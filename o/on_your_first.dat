I guess it is like climbing the highest peak <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that sort of stuff.|$|E
500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get it <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|The working {{title for}} the episode was [...] "New Girl", which changed to the current [...] "Day One" [...] by the {{beginning}} of October 2006. Head writer Chris Chibnall, who wrote the episode, found that writing the second episode was hard, as there was a challenge to demonstrate how Torchwood works, and set the formula {{for the rest of the}} series. He wanted to write an episode that would centre on Gwen about her [...] "first day in hell", and show the audience that Torchwood is unlike any normal job, as one small mistake can have major ramifications on the city. The scene where Gwen accidentally opens the meteor was meant to [...] "extend the metaphor of breaking the photocopier <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> day at work". It is also set to show the separate dynamic between the team and Gwen. Series creator Russell T Davies stated that as the rest of the team are for the aliens, science, technology and mythology, Gwen is for [...] "the people"; she's the only person in the team who cares about what happens to Carys. Eve Myles also noted in the episode's audio commentary that throughout the episode, it added a mix between her domestic life and the science fiction.|$|E

2500|$|Montgomerie is {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} best golfers never to have won a major championship, after finishing in second place on five separate occasions. During what most consider to be his best years in the 1990s Montgomerie had several close shaves. A third place at the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links was the first of these. He was prematurely congratulated by Jack Nicklaus who said [...] "Congratulations <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> U.S. Open victory" [...] to Montgomerie after he finished the 18th hole on Sunday. Tom Kite, who was still on the golf course when Montgomerie finished, wound up winning the championship.|$|E
2500|$|Colt McCoy led the Longhorns {{through the}} snow flurries to the Nebraska 5. With {{less than a minute}} remaining, Nebraska leading by one point, and the Horns facing fourth down, Texas needed a field-goal to win. Johnson had already missed three kicks (two field goals and a blocked extra point) and he told Coach Brown late in the game that his leg was {{tightening}} up. [...] Brown looked to walk-on sophomore Ryan Bailey to attempt the kick. [...] Bailey was not listed on UT's depth chart and coach Brown later admitted he wasn't sure whether Bailey had even been on the team as a freshman. [...] Bailey had made only 10 kicks as a high-school kicker from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas and he had never attempted a kick for the Longhorns. The trip to Nebraska was only the second time he had ever been included in the travel roster, which is limited to 64 players. Before the kick, Brown told him [...] "You're the luckiest guy in the world. You've got a chance to be Dusty Mangum <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> kick." [...] Mangum had scored the game-winning field goal as time expired to lift the Longhorns to victory over the Michigan Wolverines in the 2005 Rose Bowl.|$|E
