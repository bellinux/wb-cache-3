500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come".|$|E
500|$|Luca Paolini (Katusha) {{attacked}} {{from the}} main group and caught the five chasers, with Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) doing the same shortly afterwards. While Paolini and Terpstra were chasing, Geraint Thomas was blown violently from his bike, landing on his left shoulder. He landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> was able to rejoin the group, although {{he appeared to be}} shaken by the crash. As the riders approached the Kemmelberg for the final time, Roelandts had a lead of around two minutes. Vandenbergh led up the climb, with Thomas following closely and the other riders struggling. Vanmarcke and Terpstra soon caught up, with Debusschere quickly following. Paolini eventually returned to the group, but Oss was unable to do so. As they crossed the final climb of the day with [...] remaining, Roelandts had a one-minute lead ahead of the six-man group.|$|E
500|$|As the 2017 clay court swing commenced, Federer {{stepped back}} to rest and skip the entire clay season to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> hard court seasons, {{as well as to}} prolong his career. Djokovic and Murray {{returned}} from their respective elbow injuries to join alongside Nadal in competing in the 2017 Monte-Carlo Masters. Both Djokovic and Murray lost in the early stages while Nadal claimed the 2017 Monte-Carlo Masters title, which saw him becoming the first male player to historically winning a single tournament 10 times and simultaneously winning a new record most clay court titles at 50, surpassing Guillermo Vilas's 49. Nadal and Murray then both participated in Barcelona. Murray lost in the semi-finals to Dominic Thiem, while Nadal beat Thiem to win his tenth Barcelona title. This was the second week in a row in which Nadal became another tournament's 10-time champion, subsequently becoming the only male tennis player to do so for two separate ATP tournaments each, one of the ATP Masters 1000 series and the other being of the ATP 500 series. In the 2017 Madrid Open, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray competed for the title. Murray lost early while Nadal and Djokovic contested the semi-final, which Nadal won in 2 sets. Nadal then {{went on to win the}} Madrid open, again defeating Thiem in the final to claim a record 5th Madrid Open title and equal Djokovic's record of 30 ATP Masters 1000 series titles. In Rome, Murray's poor form continued, with him losing in the second round to Fabio Fognini. Nadal's unbeaten run on clay during 2017 came to an end in the quarter-finals as he was beaten by Thiem in their third meeting of the season. Djokovic, meanwhile, continued his slight improvement in form, making the final after thrashing Thiem in the semi-finals for the loss of only one game. However, he then lost the final in straight sets to Alexander Zverev Jr. where he showed that lack of continuity was still present.|$|E

2500|$|At long last, Garuda alighted {{in front}} of the waiting serpents. [...] Placing the elixir <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> thereby {{liberating}} his mother Vinata from her servitude, he urged the serpents to perform their religious ablutions before consuming it. [...] As they hurried off to do so, Indra swooped in to make off with the elixir. The serpents came back from their ablutions and saw the elixir gone but with small droplets of it on the grass. They tried to lick the droplets and thereby split their tongues in two. From then onward, serpents have split tongues and shed their skin as a kind of immortality. From that day onward, Garuda was the ally of the gods and the trusty mount of Vishnu, as well as the implacable enemy of snakes, upon whom he preyed at every opportunity.|$|E

2500|$|The narrator inexplicably {{finds himself}} in a grim and joyless city, the [...] "grey town", which is either Hell or Purgatory {{depending}} {{on whether or not}} one stays there forever. He eventually finds a bus for those who desire an excursion to some other place (and which eventually {{turns out to be the}} foothills of Heaven). He enters the bus and converses with his fellow passengers as they travel. When the bus reaches its destination, the passengers on the bus — including the narrator — are gradually revealed to be ghosts. Although the country is the most beautiful they have ever seen, every feature of the landscape (including streams of water and blades of grass) is unyieldingly solid compared to themselves: it causes them immense pain to walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> even a single leaf is far too heavy for any to lift.|$|E
2500|$|By 1990 {{overuse of}} the beach and {{surrounding}} area was a real problem, with visitors walking on the reef, swarming the surrounding areas, parking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> {{on the sides of}} the road. Commercial filming was banned during that year. Measures were taken to limit use and so visitor access was limited to the parking lot, and when it was full everyone after was turned away. [...] In 1997, the city of Honolulu levied an entrance fee on non-residents of the state, leading to a class action lawsuit by a visitor, which was settled in favor of the city during 2004. Then in August 2002 the Marine Education Center was opened at the entrance to the bay, where still today new visitors must watch a short film and receive instruction about conservation of the Bay's resources. Upon watching the film, visitors are allowed to sign a form and skip any subsequent film if they should return within the following 365 days.|$|E
