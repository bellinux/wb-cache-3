40|$|Objectives: Several donor and {{recipient}} {{factors are}} known to be associated with graft loss in a kidney transplant. In this retrospective single-center study, we analyzed the effect of clinical and immunologic factors on kidney transplant outcomes in our region in Italy. Materials and Methods: The study included 245 transplanted recipients from deceased donors at Federico II University of Naples, Kidney Transplant Centre, between the years 2000 and 2006. Age, cause of death, history of hypertension, hypotension or cardiac arrest, length of time spent in the intensive care unit, serum creatinine levels and human leukocyte antigen typing all were evaluated in the donors. Age, time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> human leukocyte antigen typing, antibody sensitization, and allocation were evaluated in the recipients. Age, donor/recipient matching, and human leukocyte antigen mismatches also were evaluated. Results: Cox regression analysis showed that in recipients, time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> increased <b>the</b> risk of restarting dialysis (OR 1. 019, 95 % CI: 1. 000 - 1. 038; P =. 050) and dying (OR 1. 017, 95 % CI: 1. 000 - 1. 038; P =. 032). Patients who received a kidney from a donor with a history of hypertension presented a major risk of death (OR 3. 212, 95 % CI: 1. 190 - 8. 668; P =. 021), while human leukocyte antigen-A mismatch increased the risk of restarting dialysis (OR 3. 137, 95 % CI: 1. 255 - 7. 842; P =. 014). Conclusions: In our study, in recipients, time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> and a history of hypertension were associated with a greater risk of death.

They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports, 86,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field. The average wait is said to be over 30 years, but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.

The sell-out streak has had the effect (intended or not) of ensuring that all Packers home games are televised in Green Bay and Milwaukee, a streak that started in 1973 (prior to that time, local telecasts of home games were disallowed regardless of how many tickets were sold); the Packers are one of four NFL teams (the others being the Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, and Pittsburgh Steelers) that have not had a home game blacked out since the 1973 blackout rules were put into place.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{transplantation}} has changed survival from {{as low as}} 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today. Liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with ALF, and survival rates of 56–90% can be achieved. In addition to transplantation, better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of transplantation among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized.

40|$|Given {{the limited}} pool of donor organs, {{accurate}} predictions of survival <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> and post transplantation are crucial for cardiac transplantation decisions and policy. However, current clinical risk scores do not yield accurate predictions. We {{develop a new}} methodology (ToPs, Trees of Predictors) built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> principle that specific predictors {{should be used for}} specific clusters within the target population. ToPs discovers these specific clusters of patients and the specific predictor that perform best for each cluster. In comparison with current clinical risk scoring systems, our method provides significant improvements in the prediction of survival time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> and post transplantation. For example, in terms of 3 month survival for patients who were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> US patient <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> in <b>the</b> period 1985 to 2015, our method achieves AUC of 0. 847, the best commonly used clinical risk score (MAGGIC) achieves 0. 630. In terms of 3 month survival/mortality predictions (in comparison to MAGGIC), holding specificity at 80. 0 percents, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 1, 228 (26. 0 percents more patients out of 4, 723 who actually survived, holding sensitivity at 80. 0 percents, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 839 (33. 0 percents) more patients out of 2, 542 who did not survive. Our method achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions post transplantation. Therefore, we offer a more accurate, personalized approach to survival analysis that can benefit patients, clinicians and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because risk prediction is widely used in diagnostic and prognostic clinical decision making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far reaching.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} {{objective and}} subjective indicators {{of death in}} prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients in a follow-up study of 12 months. Methods The study included end-stage renal disease patients undergoing HD and analyzed demographic and laboratory data from the dialysis unit's records. Baseline data concerning socioeconomic status, comorbidity, quality of life level, coping style and depression were also assessed. For variables that differed in the comparison between survivors and non-survivors, Cox proportional hazards for death were calculated. Results The mortality rate was 13. 0 %. Non-survivors differed in age, comorbidity, inclusion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transplant <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and physical functioning score. The hazard ratios of death were 8. 958 (2. 843 - 28. 223; p p = 0. 007) for not being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transplant <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> 1. 038 (1. 012 - 1. 066; p = 0. 005) for age, and 0. 980 (0. 964 - 0. 996; p = 0. 014) for physical functioning.

2500|$|This term also {{refers to}} a series of living donor transplants in which one donor donates to the highest {{recipient}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and the transplant center utilizes that donation to facilitate multiple transplants. These other transplants are otherwise impossible due to blood type or antibody barriers to transplantation. The [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] kidney is transplanted into one of the other recipients, whose donor in turn donates his or her kidney to an unrelated recipient. Depending on the person <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> this has sometimes been repeated for up to six pairs, with the final donor donating to the person {{at the top of the}} list. This method allows all organ recipients to get a transplant even if their living donor is not a match to them.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> period spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> true inpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> {{is a valid}} indication of the total time that patients {{have to wait for}} an operation; and to assess the feasibility of monitoring <b>the</b> total "postreferral <b>waiting</b> time" by using existing computerised information systems. SETTING [...] Three randomly selected Scottish hospitals. SUBJECTS [...] <b>Waiting</b> <b>list</b> patients admitted to hospital for operations during June to August 1993 in six major specialties, separate attention being focused on cataract operations and hip and knee replacements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] The total time that patients have to wait for an operation after the initial general practitioner referral [...] <b>the</b> postreferral <b>waiting</b> time [...] compared with that spent at the final stage of <b>the</b> process <b>on</b> <b>the</b> true inpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> RESULTS [...] In the specialties investigated roughly half (58 days; 53 %) of <b>the</b> average postreferral <b>wait</b> of 110 days was spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> true inpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> one third (35 days; 32 %) being spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and one sixth (17 days; 15 %) <b>waiting</b> between <b>waiting</b> <b>lists.</b> Only a quarter of cataract patients (73 / 292) were treated within three months of general practitioner referral compared with over three quarters (228 / 292) within three months of being placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> Nevertheless, within a year over 99 % of patients (290) had been treated whichever date was taken as the starting point. CONCLUSIONS [...] Monitoring postreferral waiting times would provide a much more accurate picture for purchasers and patients of waiting times for treatment than is obtained by focusing exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> true inpatient <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and facilitate fairer comparisons between NHS trusts in national league tables.
