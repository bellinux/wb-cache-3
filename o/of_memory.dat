5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{scenarios}} where customized allocators are desirable. Some {{of the most common}} reasons for writing custom allocators include improving performance of allocations by using memory pools, and encapsulating access to different types <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> like shared memory or garbage-collected memory. In particular, programs with many frequent allocations of small amounts <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> may benefit greatly from specialized allocators, both in terms of running time and memory footprint.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{should be}} copy-constructible. An {{allocator}} for objects of type T {{can be constructed}} from an allocator for objects of type U. If an allocator, A, allocates a region <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> R, then R can only be deallocated by an allocator that compares equal to A.|$|E

5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> can last for a lifetime.

5|$|In 1978, Lawrence {{purchased}} the Commodore PET 2001 {{and no longer}} needed the university's computer. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight kilobytes <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> Due {{to a lack of}} space, he designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would not have to be stored in memory. Lack <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> was Lawrence's primary design obstacle. Nevertheless, the final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port required a more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's most popular port was for the Commodore 64.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of chronic pain on the recall <b>of</b> autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> pain and non-pain events was examined. Eleven chronic pain patients and 11 age- and sex-matched control subjects retrieved autobiographical memories to neutral and pain-related cue words. Patients and controls retrieved equal numbers <b>of</b> <b>memories,</b> but pain subjects retrieved more <b>memories</b> incorporating elements <b>of</b> physical pain. Analysis {{of the content}} <b>of</b> these <b>memories</b> revealed that patients and controls recalled equal numbers <b>of</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> themselves and other people in acute pain and that the difference observed was attributable to the pain patients recalling <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> themselves in chronic pain. <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> pain were recalled significantly faster than non-pain memories.

40|$|At whole, {{this thesis}} {{analyzes}} {{the measurement of}} brand equity in <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant, one of a Chinese restaurant in Arnhem, Nederland. This thesis is divided into six chapters, which {{each has its own}} content. Chapter one is introduction. It tells about the background of the research, the research problem definition and the research objective- the purpose of this thesis. Chapter two is the general overview about the company. It contains the history <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant, and the background of choosing the name and the symbol <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant. The literature review about the brand equity used in the research problem is explained on chapter three. The fourth chapter discusses about the research methodology used in this thesis. It combines the qualitative and quantitative method on this research. The writers will do the in-depth interview with the owner <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant and the guest. It is about their perception <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant?s brand. Some questionnaires are spread to some Arnhem citizens. After that the writers will compare the result of the questionnaires with the theories that the writers have. The fifth chapter is the main discussion of this thesis whereas all data that have been collected through interviews and observation are being analyzed. The analysis is done based on theories existed. And the last chapter describes about the conclusions about the research and the recommendation for <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant that could be implemented in order to increase the performance and quality <b>of</b> <b>Memories</b> <b>of</b> Asia Restaurant...|$|R
