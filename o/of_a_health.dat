5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Health</b> Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Croc: Legend of the Gobbos was first teased {{on the back}} of the Sega Saturn version of the game’s manual. Initially advertised for a Christmas 1998 release,Croc 2 was {{released}} in June of 1999 for the Sony PlayStation, and later for Microsoft Windows and the Game Boy Color. A Sega Saturn release was also advertised but never released, and a Sega Dreamcast port of the game was ultimately cancelled. The game follows Croc as he once again ventures to defeat Baron Dante, who has captured an old inventor Gobbo, while simultaneously searching for his long-lost parents. The game makes numerous gameplay changes from the first game, including the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>health</b> counter, more mission-based levels, and an open HUB area for navigating levels. A 2D side-scrolling port of the game for the Game Boy Color, simply titled Croc, was released in June 2000. Three mobile phone games based on the game, developed by Morpheme, were released through the mid-2000s, titled Croc Mobile: Jungle Rumble, Croc Mobile Pinball, and Croc Mobile: Volcanic Panic!.|$|E

However, little is known about factors that may influence <b>a</b> person&rsquo;s likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate. Purpose: This study was designed to examine factors that influence <b>a</b> person&rsquo;s likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate. Methods: The participants were 889 randomly selected community members who were assigned to read one of six vignettes. Social support and confidence in the health care system were manipulated in the vignettes. Social support was either high or low and overall confidence was high, moderate, or low. The dependent variables were participants&rsquo; likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate and the hourly rate participants were willing to pay for <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate for six different services. Results: The results indicated that social support did not affect the likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate; however, confidence in the health care system did affect the likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate. Participants who read vignettes, in which the patient was described as having lower overall confidence levels, indicated <b>a</b> greater likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate than participants who read the vignettes in which the patient was described as having high confidence. Conclusions: More {{research is needed to determine}} other factors that may influence the likelihood <b>of</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate and whether hiring <b>a</b> <b>health</b> advocate is <b>a</b> cost-effective way to improve the quality of health care by reducing the number of medical mistakes and improving patient-provider communication.

40|$|The {{population}} of Paracatu {{is at risk}} <b>of</b> Arsenic (<b>As)</b> exposure associated with long-term exploration of the largest open pit gold mine in Brazil. <b>As</b> part <b>of</b> the interdisciplinary research "The Paracatu project: Arsenic environmental contamination and human health risks assessment in Paracatu-MG", carried out between 2011 and 2013, we used data disaggregated by gender to identify the sources of As-related information being accessed by inhabitants of Paracatu and to examine if access to these sources was correlated to awareness <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>health</b> effects and adoption of behaviors to reduce risk <b>of</b> <b>As</b> exposure. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were carried out with 460 participants (294 women and 166 men) {{to collect data on}} respondent's socio-demographic characteristics, use of mass media and social communication networks as sources <b>of</b> information on <b>As</b> issues, the trustworthiness of these information sources, awareness <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>health</b> effects, and adoption of behaviors to reduce As exposure. For both men and women, interpersonal communication was used and trusted more frequently than mass media to obtain information on <b>As.</b> Discussion <b>of</b> <b>As</b> issues occurred preferentially among individuals of the same gender and was associated with awareness <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>health</b> risks. There are marked differences in variables correlated with the adoption of behaviors to reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>As</b> exposure between men and women. Discussing As issues with women was associated with adoption of risk-reduction practices for both genders. In contrast, men who discuss As issues with other men were less likely to adopt As exposure prevention behaviors. Finally, adoption was associated with awareness <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>health</b> effects for women, but {{this was not the case}} for men. Policy implications for decision makers, practitioners and researchers are discussed, based on concrete examples of how gender-specific approaches can effectively guide the formulation and implementation of health promotion campaigns and programs...|$|R
