25|$|<b>Osteoglossids</b> are basal {{fish that}} {{originated}} some {{time during the}} Cretaceous, and are placed in the actinopterygiid order Osteoglossiformes. As traditionally defined, the family includes several extant species from South America, one from Africa, several from Asia, and two from Australia. Today Arapaimidae is often regarded as a separate family, which includes the arapaimas and the African arowana. Consequently, the South American genus Osteoglossum, and the Asian and Australian genus Scleropages are the only extant genera that remain in the osteoglossid family. Arapaimidae and Osteoglossidae split about 220 million years ago (Mya), during the Late Triassic.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Osteoglossidae, Asian arowanas are highly adapted to fresh water and are {{incapable}} of surviving in the ocean. Therefore, their spread throughout the islands of southeast Asia suggests they diverged from other <b>osteoglossids</b> before the continental breakup was complete. Genetic studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing the ancestor of the Asian arowanas diverged from the ancestor of the Australian arowanas, S. jardinii and S. leichardti, about 140million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous period. This divergence took place in the eastern margin of Gondwanaland, with the ancestors of Asian arowanas carried on the Indian subcontinent or smaller landmasses into Asia. The morphological similarity of all Scleropages species shows little evolutionary change has taken place recently for these ancient fish.|$|E
40|$|Some bony remains, {{otoliths}} and squamules {{belonging to}} the <b>osteoglossid</b> genus Scleropages are described from the continental Paleocene of Hainin (Mons Basin, Belgium).

40|$|The marine <b>osteoglossid</b> “Brychaetus” caheni {{from the}} Lower Paleocene of Cabinda (Africa) is re-studied.

40|$|The author {{describes}} the snout osteology of the fossil Osteoglossidae Phareodus and Brychaetus. He {{shows that the}} two genera considerably differ in their naso-ethmoid region. Indeed, Phareodus encaustus and P. queenslandicus possess a large dermethmoid contacting the frontals and separating the two nasals from each other, which is the primitive condition within teleosts. P. testis {{is a little more}} specialized. Its dermethmoid still separates partially the two nasals but it begins to lose its contact with the frontals. On the contrary, Brychaetus muelleri exhibits a specialized snout pattern. The two nasals, articulated with the frontals, are joined together on almost their entire length, except at their anterior edge where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from the frontals, is inserted between them, as in Osteoglossum and Scleropages. Thus, Brychaetus is a valid genus and not a synonym of Phareodus. The author also shows that the <b>osteoglossid</b> Musperia radiata, from the Eocene of Indonesia, displays the same advanced snout pattern as Brychaetus and the two Recent Osteoglossidae. The caudal skeleton of Musperia is described for the first time. The first preural and the first ural centra bear complete neural spines. The five hypurals are autogenous. There is a pair of uroneurals and no epural...|$|R

40|$|Soon after hatching, the <b>osteoglossid</b> fish Arapaima gigas {{undergoes}} a rapid {{transition from a}} water breather to an obligate air breather. This {{is followed by a}} gradual disappearance of gill lamellae, which leaves smooth filaments with a reduced branchial diffusion capacity due to loss of surface area, and a fourfold increase in diffusion distance. This study evaluated the effects these changes have on gill function by examining two size classes of fish that differ in gill morphology. In comparison to smaller fish (∼ 67. 5 g), which still have lamellae, larger fish (∼ 724. 2 g) without lamellae took up a slightly greater percentage of O 2 across the gills (30. 1 % vs. 23. 9 %), which indicates that the morphological changes do not place limitations on O 2 uptake in larger fish. Both size groups excreted similar percentages of CO 2 across the gills (85 %– 90 %). However, larger fish had higher blood Pco 2 (vs. mmHg) and (vs. mmol L− 1) concentrations and lower blood pH (vs.) than did smaller fish, despite having lower mass‐specific metabolisms, suggesting a possible diffusion limitation for CO 2 excretion in larger fish. With regard to ion regulation, rates of diffusive Na+ loss were about 3. 5 times higher in larger fish than they were in smaller fish, despite the lowered branchial diffusion capacity, and rates of Na+ uptake were higher by about the same amount despite 40 % lower activity of branchial Na+/K+‐ATPase. Kinetic analysis of Na+ uptake revealed an extremely low‐affinity (μmol L− 1), low‐capacity (nmol g− 1 h− 1) transport system. These data may reflect a general reduction {{in the role of the}} gills in ion balance. Renal Na+/K+‐ATPase activity was 5 – 10 times higher than Na+/K+‐ATPase activity in the gills, and urine:plasma ratios for Na+ and Cl− were very low (0. 001 – 0. 005) relative to that of other fish, which suggested an increased role for dietary salt intake and renal salt retention and which was representative of a more “terrestrial” mode of ion regulation. Such de‐emphasis of branchial ion regulation confers greatly reduced sensitivity of diffusive ion loss to low water pH. Ammonia excretion also appeared to be impacted by gill changes. Rates of ammonia excretion in larger fish were one‐third less than that in smaller fish, despite larger fish having blood ammonia concentrations that were twice as high...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Maastrichtian Deccan Intertrappean otolith {{association}} allows for the reconstruction of a fish fauna of 22 taxa, of which 16 are identified at species level. Three species are new: “genus Heterotidinarum” heterotoides, “genus Percoideorum” citreum and Dapalis erici. The represented taxa include typical freshwater ones, essentially freshwater ones with some marine intruders, near shore marine groups including {{a significant portion of}} freshwater intruders and predominantly marine fishes, including however some scarce freshwater residents. The most probable interpretation of such an association is that the Deccan Intertrappean Beds correspond to freshwater environments of a coastal area, where intrusion by marine elements or temporary connections with the marine realm existed. The Indian Maastrichtian and Ypresian faunas are compared with the European fossil record. The fossil record of <b>osteoglossids,</b> ambassids, and channids points to ancient Eurasiatic affinities of European freshwater and brackish Paleogene and Early Miocene fish faunas...|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{morphological}} {{studies have}} addressed the interrelationships of Osteoglossomorpha, a group that sometimes is considered the sister group of all other living teleostean fishes. Many characters used in these studies {{were found to be}} poorly defined, to be coded incorrectly or illogically, or to display more variation than was described. The goal {{of this study is to}} address these concerns and contribute generally to knowledge of the morphology and systematic relationships of osteoglossomorphs. Analysis of 72 characters scored for 20 genera resulted in 2 most parsimonious cladograms. The only difference in the topologies of these cladograms is in the position of †Lycoptera (recovered as either the sister group of all other osteoglossomorphs sampled or of †Eohiodon + Hiodon). †Ostariostoma is recovered as the sister group of all non-hiodontiform osteoglossomorphs. Mormyrids are sister group of notopterids + <b>osteoglossids</b> (including Pantodon). Mormyrids and notopterids usually are considered more closely related to each other than to any other group; characters not included here support this relationship and future consideration of these characters must be made. † Palaeonotopterus is interpreted as sister-group of all mormyrids sampled; however, only 22 % of characters could be scored for it and its resemblance to notopterids are undeniable. General problems of character definition are discussed in my review of characters used in previous analyses. ...|$|E
