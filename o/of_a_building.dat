5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building.</b> As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E

5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase {{the supply of}} energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies {{reduce the need for}} alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give the impression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are {{the work of the}} restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
50|$|Firewalls {{can be used}} to {{subdivide}} <b>a</b> <b>building</b> {{into separate}} fire areas and are constructed in accordance with the locally applicable building codes. Firewalls are <b>a</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building's</b> passive fire protection systems.|$|R

5|$|By 1909, the {{collection}} {{had grown to}} 10,000 volumes and 10,000 pamphlets, with R. J. Nichols as the librarian. The library collection continued to grow and totaled 36,478 volumes in 1918. In February 1917, the state legislature gave the school $65,000 towards construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> to house the library.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E

40|$|Throughout the {{conceptual}} and design stages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building’s</b> construction cycle, numerous {{decisions are made}} and modified, based on cost/benefit measurements. Early on, the Building Owner and the design team make determinations as to the quality level target for a project, based on market needs and trends as well as financial capabilities and interests of investors. For instance, in the case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> office <b>building,</b> will it provide “Class A ” or a “Class B ” office space? These decisions affect nearly every aspect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building’s</b> parts and pieces. In this case, we will concentrate on the noise and vibration options and choices related to <b>a</b> <b>building’s</b> plumbing and piping systems.

5|$|In the 1900, a final {{attempt to}} {{increase}} the attendance of the camp meetings at Mountain Grove Campground {{was made by the}} Board of Managers. As well as general renovation, this included an addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> called the Preacher's Home, which was situated behind the auditorium. The purpose of this was to attract preachers to attend, thus inspiring locals to attend as well. This plan was not successful.|$|E
5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in violation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> code prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above the garage. The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the garage. No part of the building was in violation of the code.|$|E
5|$|The first church {{building}} was erected in 1886 in Oconto, Wisconsin, by local women who believed Christian Science had helped them. For {{a down payment}} of $2,000 and a mortgage of $8,763, the church purchased land in Falmouth Street, Boston, for the erection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building.</b> Eddy asked Augusta Stetson, a prominent Scientist, to establish a church in New York. By the end of 1886 Christian Science teaching institutes had sprung up around the United States.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E
5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack off the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain {{the location of a}} valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> have been {{discovered}} in many European countries, {{as well as in}} other parts of the world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
