5|$|The {{debate about}} {{his place in}} the Conservative pantheon has {{continued}} since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and was succeeded by Lord Granby; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being. While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase Hughenden Manor, in Buckinghamshire. The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London {{for the rest of their}} marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{was born}} and raised in Cape Town, the son of the South African {{politician}} P V van der Byl, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading agitators for Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
50|$|He was Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand from 1968 to 1976, when he {{resigned}} {{to become a}} Member of Parliament. He strongly opposed many of the policies <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> leader, Robert Muldoon.|$|R
60|$|No {{one would}} ever know what it had cost him to obtain these papers. No {{one would ever}} know how much he had sacrificed of pride, revenge and hate {{in order to save}} a few shreds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> honour.|$|R
25|$|Remarkably, Nixon won the {{election}} despite winning {{only two of the}} six states (Arizona and South Carolina) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier. He remains the only presidential candidate to win in spite of defending such a low number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> states. All <b>of</b> the remaining four States carried by Goldwater were carried by Wallace in 1968. They would be won by Nixon in 1972.|$|R
5|$|When Lord Melbourne loses {{a vote in}} Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, {{wishes to}} replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with {{supporters}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation {{to form a new}} government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Ravalomanana {{decided to}} {{register}} {{as an independent}} candidate in the Antananarivo mayoral election rather than finance a representative from another party. The president of the Judged by Your Work Party (AVI), Norbert Lala Ratsirahonana, had met the entrepreneur several years prior in relation to Tiko business matters. The two discussed the possibility that Ravalomanana could run as an AVI candidate, but this idea was abandoned. His principal opponent, former Prime Minister Guy Willy Razanamasy of the Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar (AREMA party), suffered from low popularity, leading Ratsiraka to tacitly support Ravalomanana's candidature against the representative <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> By contrast, Ravalomanana was an unknown, attracting attention primarily for his considerable success in employment and wealth creation through Tiko, and his esteemed role as Vice President of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, which was vocal in its support for the candidate.|$|E
5|$|Since its legalization in 2005, couples from a {{cross section}} of Spanish society have entered into {{same-sex}} marriages. Within the first year the law received royal assent, an influential socialist leader and Madrid city councilor Pedro Zerolo married Jesús Santos in January, and popular television presenter Jesús Vázquez married Roberto Cortés in March. In October 2005, Spain's prominent anti-terrorism judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska married his fiancé Gorka Gómez. In August 2006, Ourense city councilor and member of the People's Party Pepe Araujo, whose party originally opposed the law, married his fiancé Nino Crespo. In September 2006, Alberto Linero Marchena and Alberto Sánchez Fernández, both army soldiers assigned to the Morón Air Base near Seville, became Spain's first military personnel to marry under the new law. In August 2008, Doña Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia and three-time Grandee of Spain (branded the Red Duchess for her socialist activism), became the highest ranking Spanish noble to marry in an articulo mortis (deathbed) wedding to longtime companion Liliana Maria Dahlmann, now the Dowager Duchess of Medina Sidonia by right of her late wife. In June 2015, the then mayor of the Basque capital Vitoria, Javier Maroto, announced his engagement to longtime partner Josema Rodríguez. The wedding was held on 18 September 2015 at Vitoria's City Hall. Maroto, a member of the conservative People's Party's national board, is known for his views contrary to the stance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> pertaining to same-sex marriage in Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had challenged the law approving same sex marriage when he was Opposition Leader, attended the wedding celebrations as a guest.|$|E
50|$|Although {{accused of}} {{corruption}} after leaving office, Lusinchi was popular during his presidency, and was succeeded {{by a member}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political <b>party,</b> Carlos Andrés Pérez.|$|R

50|$|Ram had rallied an All India Congress Committee (U) meeting <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> {{expelling}} <b>party</b> leader Devraj Urs {{from the}} party. As a direct consequence Ram {{was expelled from}} Congress (U).|$|R
25|$|In Texas, Connally {{was finding}} himself {{at odds with}} the more liberal wing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> and on the {{national}} stage, Democrats were becoming bitterly divided over the Vietnam War. Johnson solicited Strauss's advice on the issue.|$|E
25|$|But {{there were}} exceptions. His friend Karl Liebknecht stood {{alone in the}} Berlin Reichstag, and against 110 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>Party</b> members, when he voted against German war credits. Learning of Liebknecht's action, Ture Nerman knew which side he was on.|$|E
25|$|In December, the DPJ {{created a}} {{government}} {{task force to}} review government spending and pledged to make cuts equal to $32.8billion. However, the task force cut {{only a quarter of}} that amount. Hatoyama even had to renege on a campaign promise to cut road-related taxes – including a highly symbolic gasoline tax and highway tolls. Hatoyama faced criticism from fringes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> some calling for a return to public works spending.|$|E
50|$|In the Republican primary, Joe Lhota, {{a former}} deputy mayor and former {{chairman}} of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority carried every borough but Staten Island, which was won by John Catsimatidis, a businessman, publisher and property developer. Catsimatidis, in losing, won nearly as large a percentage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> vote (40.69%) as the Democratic winner, Bill de Blasio won <b>of</b> <b>his</b> (40.81%). The 61,111 valid votes cast in the Republican primary were less than one-eleventh of the 691,801 cast in the Democratic one held on the same day in the same polling places.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Four Powers Commission, the LPP was weakened by internal splits. Woldeab Woldemariam left the party to form a group <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> The <b>party</b> was dissolved in December 1950.|$|R
25|$|Winthrop Rockefeller had {{few members}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> to guide his {{programs}} through the legislature. Eleven of Rockefeller vetoes were overridden, {{far more than}} for other Arkansas governors in a four-year period. The fate of Rockefeller programs rested with the Democratic legislators, one of whom, Arkansas House Speaker Sterling R. Cockrill of Little Rock, provided assistance to Rockefeller and in 1970 even joined the Republican Party to run for lieutenant governor on Rockefeller's ticket when Maurice Britt stepped down.|$|E
25|$|A {{political}} fight {{which began}} as a conflict between the President and the Supreme Court turned into a battle between Roosevelt and the recalcitrant members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> in the Congress. The political consequences were wide-reaching, extending beyond the narrow question of judicial reform to implicate the political future of the New Deal itself. Not only was bipartisan support for Roosevelt's agenda largely dissipated by the struggle, the overall loss of political capital {{in the arena of}} public opinion was also significant.|$|E
25|$|The touch {{paper for}} the final crisis was the {{unlikely}} subject of the sale of captured German assets in Nigeria. As Colonial Secretary, the Conservative leader Bonar Law led the debate and was subject to a furious attack by Sir Edward Carson. The issue itself was trivial, {{but the fact that}} Law had been attacked by a leading member <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> and was not supported by Lloyd George (who absented himself from the House only to dine with Carson later in the evening), was not.|$|E
50|$|Governor L. C. Hughes {{had taken}} office {{shortly before the}} close of the {{previous}} session. The governor's time in office since then had been tumultuous with many influential territorial members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political <b>party</b> calling for his removal from office.|$|R
50|$|Rodriguez Saá {{lost the}} support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Justicialist <b>Party</b> and {{resigned}} {{before the end}} of the year.

5000|$|Muhammad Jusuf Kalla ( [...] ; born 15 May 1942) is an Indonesian {{politician}} {{who has been}} Vice President of Indonesia since 2014, having previously served from 2004 to 2009. He was unsuccessful as Golkar's presidential candidate in the 2009 presidential election. Since 2009 Kalla {{has served as the}} Chairman of the Indonesian Red Cross Society. Before Kalla declared himself as the running mate for Joko Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, a 2012 poll placed his popularity among likely voters in the top three contenders for the presidency and ahead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> nominee Aburizal Bakrie. He is the first person to hold two non-consecutive terms as Vice President of Indonesia.|$|R
25|$|As a legislator, Austin {{spoke out}} against an early attempt to {{increase}} legislators' salaries and later {{was one of only}} two legislators (193-2) to vote against increasing legislators' travel allowance from 15-17 cents per mile. He sponsored legislation for strict reporting requirements for lobbyists; criticized the leadership <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> for the hiring practices of former legislators; and provided Governor Thornburgh with the deciding vote which defined the authority of the state's first elected Attorney General over the objections of the leadership in his party.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{opposed the}} death penalty and {{supported}} legalisation of abortion and homosexuality; this did not help his acceptance by the more right-wing elements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> at the time. Macleod established good personal relations with several of his Labour opposite numbers, including both Bevan and James Callaghan, even though he clashed with Callaghan numerous times at the dispatch box while serving as Shadow Chancellor in the 1960s (by contrast, he did not get on with Callaghan's successor as Chancellor, Roy Jenkins, considering him vain and arrogant).|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{marked the}} third consecutive presidential victory for the Republican Party, and the first and, to date, last time that a party had won more than two consecutive presidential elections since the Democrats won all five elections from 1932 to 1948. Bush was the first sitting vice president to be elected president since Martin Van Buren in 1836, and the first successor to be elected from the same party since Herbert Hoover in 1928. To date, {{this is the last}} election in which a retiring president was succeeded by a member <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Adams' {{re-election}} in 1898 {{was not without}} controversy as he was opposed by Governor Hazen S.

50|$|Similar {{to other}} African leaders during the {{immediate}} independence era, Tsiranana oversaw the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> {{power at the}} expense of other parties. A political system that strongly favored the incumbent complemented these actions. For example, although the political process allowed minority parties to participate, the constitution mandated a winner-take-all system that effectively denied the opposition a voice in governance. Tsiranana's position was further strengthened by the broad, multiethnic popular base of the PSD among the côtiers, whereas the opposition was severely disorganized. The AKFM continued to experience intraparty rifts between leftist and ultranationalist, more orthodox Marxist factions; it was unable to capitalize on increasingly active but relatively less privileged Malagasy youth because the party's base was the Merina middle class.|$|R
25|$|Lula's {{administration}} {{was plagued by}} corruption scandals, notably the mensalão scandal and s in his first term. The Brazilian Attorney-General presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensalão affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Top officials involved, such as Roberto Jefferson, José Dirceu, Luiz Gushiken and Humberto Costa denied {{he was aware of}} any wrongdoing; but one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> members, Alindo Chinaglia, alleged that Lula had been warned that the corruption existed. Having lost numerous government aides in the face of political turmoil, Lula survived largely unscathed {{in the eyes of the}} public, with overwhelming approval rates.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Blaine {{was from}} the reform wing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> but the Mugwumps {{rejected}} his candidacy. This division among Republicans {{may have contributed to}} the victory in 1884 of Grover Cleveland, the first president elected from the Democratic party since the Civil War. In the period from 1876 to 1892, presidential elections were closely contested at the national level, but the states themselves were mostly dominated by a single party, with Democrats prevailing in the South and the Republicans in the Northeast. Although the defection of the Mugwumps may have helped Cleveland win in New York, one of the few closely contested states, historians attribute Cleveland's victory nationwide to the rising power of urban immigrant voters.|$|E
25|$|Gradually French Cardinals de Bernis and Luynes {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was impossible to find any better candidate with chances for the election than initially rejected by them Cardinal Braschi. This was the turning point of the conclave. The Braschi's candidature gained important and influential allies. But Spain and Portugal still opposed him as too much devoted to Jesuits. Braschi also had some opponents in the radical wing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> To secure the required majority for Braschi, Cardinal de Bernis aligned himself with Cardinal Zelada, who recentely acted as mediator: de Bernis had to convince the political factions, while Zelada had to overcome the opposition among radical Zelanti. Also Cardinal Albani was engaged in the promotion of Braschi.|$|E
5000|$|Wappel was not {{appointed}} to Jean Chrétien's cabinet, {{and was a}} frequent critic <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> social legislation. He opposed the Chrétien government's decision to extend anti-discrimination protection to homosexuals in 1994, describing homosexuality as [...] "statistically abnormal, ... physically abnormal and ... morally immoral".
