5|$|A {{red cross}} {{was a symbol}} for many Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries.

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> MSE performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> pilots symbols {{with respect}} to <b>the</b> existing <b>designs.</b> First, we compare each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> pilot set with the existing IEEE 802.16 e standard pilot symbols separately, i.e., SISO–OFDM mode. The aim is to observe <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> pilot symbols in each antenna {{with respect to}} the standard one to ensure that each designed pilot set has better performance. A noteworthy fact is that, when some SISO–OFDM methods are adopted in MIMO–OFDM pilot <b>designs</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> some <b>designed</b> pilot set deteriorates with increased number of transmit antennas. This implies that, only a few pilot sets yield a significant performance.|$|R

5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of the time, {{like the one}} planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral {{was one of the}} largest in the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> many {{operational}} officers {{were opposed to}} the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Features at {{the park}} include a fountain, artworks, a cafe, and a {{distinctive}} glass canopy. Director Park was designed by Laurie Olin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> firm OLIN, and the Portland-based architectural firm ZGF Architects. The park {{is part of what}} had originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect the two sets of park blocks arose in the 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made a proposal for what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E

5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in two versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, {{at the time a}} cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E
