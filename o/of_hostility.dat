5|$|Although it was {{intended}} for Magnus and Olaf to rule the kingdom jointly without division, in practice Olaf ruled over Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway), while Magnus controlled the Uplands and Trøndelag (the middle parts of Norway) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway. Despite of this division, {{there are no signs}} <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> between the brothers, and their relationship appears to have been peaceful.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century William Shakespeare and {{his contemporaries}} lived in London {{at a time}} <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> to the {{development}} of the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and German {{troops were}} {{involved}} in the unofficial cessations <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> along the Western Front. The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when German troops decorated the area around their trenches in the region of Ypres, Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|E

The deal set out the Terms for a Cessation <b>of</b> <b>Hostilities</b> in Syria. Russia and the U.S. proposed that the cessation <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> commence at 00:00 (Damascus time) on February 27, 2016.

With great difficulty he assembled 30,000 men; half of whom {{on the second day}} returned with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them.

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder is shown {{evidence}} of alien life which may actually {{be part of a}} huge government hoax designed to deflect attention from secret military programs. Meanwhile, Scully struggles with her cancer in the face <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> from her brother, who believes she should no longer be working.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> and disappointment.|$|E

5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained an attitude <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|In his New Policies {{sponsored}} by Shenzong, Wang Anshi enhanced central authority over Song's frontier administrations, increased militia activity, increased troop levels and war horses {{sent to the}} frontiers (including the border areas with Đại Việt), and actively sought loyal supporters in border regions who could heighten the pace of extraction of local resources for the state's disposal. Officials at court debated the merits or faults of Wang's policies, yet criticism of his reforms even appeared in Đại Việt, where the high officer Lý Thường Kiệt (1019–1105) publicly announced that Wang's policies were deliberate efforts to seize and control their border frontiers. Tensions between Song and Lý were critical, and in these conditions any sign <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> had potential to ignite a war.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the decline {{experienced}} by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, the Vietnamese Government began repairing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries {{as part of a}} greater effort to rejuvenate Vietnam's shattered economy. Since its invasion in 1979, China had placed sustained pressure on the northern borders of Vietnam, with the province of Ha Tuyen regularly shelled by Chinese artillery. In September 1985, Chinese bombardment of Ha Tuyen reached a peak when 2,000 rounds were fired. To reduce the state <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> along the border region, and ultimately normalise relations with China, the Vietnamese Government dropped all hostile references to China at the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986, and also adopted the Doi Moi policy. In August 1990, as the Cambodian Peace Plan, authored by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, was being endorsed by the UN Security Council, both China and Vietnam moved towards accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp governed England while Richard {{was on the}} Third Crusade, but his {{authority}} was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused a great deal <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} <b>of</b> <b>hostility,</b> fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point <b>of</b> <b>hostility.</b> Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The German {{government}} {{had been hoping}} that the Ottomans would enter the war to support them but the government in Istanbul was undecided. The Germanophile Ottoman War Minister, Enver Pasha, began conspiring with the German ambassador to bring the empire into the war. Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian vessels into opening fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display <b>of</b> <b>hostility,</b> causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{difficulties}} in domestic policy contrasted with notable accomplishments in foreign policy. He {{had long been}} an advocate of expansionism toward the Pacific and free trade, and was fond of evoking themes of national destiny {{and the spread of}} liberty in support of these policies. His positions were largely in line with Jackson's earlier efforts to promote American commerce across the Pacific. Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets, he sent lawyer Caleb Cushing to China, where he negotiated the terms of the Treaty of Wanghia (1844). The same year, he sent Henry Wheaton as a minister to Berlin, where he negotiated and signed a trade agreement with the Zollverein, a coalition of German states that managed tariffs. This treaty was rejected by the Whigs, mainly as a show <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> toward the Tyler administration.|$|E

5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for one reason or another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign <b>of</b> <b>hostility,</b> and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
5|$|In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, {{a son of}} the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), began {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up {{with the rest of}} the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> towards him amongst its troops. Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.|$|E
