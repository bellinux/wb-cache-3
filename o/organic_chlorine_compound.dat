The major components of NOM are humic substances (HS) which are typically naturally occurring compounds that account for 30 – 80 % of the dissolved organic matters in natural water (Yang et al. 2004). HS mainly consist of humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and humin (Matilainen et al. 2011). Since the early 1970 s, water quality and treatment issues related to NOM have been reported, where these substances in natural water facilitated bacteria reproduction during drinking water distribution and produced harmful disinfection by-products (DBP), such as trihalomethanes (THMs), during chlorination process. They also caused {{a reduction in the}} effectiveness of water purification by interfering with various oxidants, increasing the solubility of heavy metals due to complexation with metals and adsorbed organic pollutants (Yang et al. 2007).

40|$|Alguns compostos organoclorados são motivo de grande preocupação, em razão da elevada toxicidade e persistência, tanto no meio ambiente quanto em organismos vivos. Dentre tais compostos, encontra-se o pentaclorofenol, utilizado para a conservação de madeira e na proteção de lavouras. Uma das tecnologias mais promissoras para o tratamento dessa classe de compostos tóxicos é a hidrodescloração catalítica, através da qual é possível recuperar a matéria-prima utilizada na síntese do contaminante. Embora diferentes catalisadores possam ser utilizados nesta reação, destacam-se os sólidos à base de Pd e Ru, notadamente devido à maior atividade catalítica. No entanto, os elevados preços destes metais nobres podem aumentar significativamente os custos do processo. Nesse contexto, o objetivo do presente trabalho é estudar os efeitos da presença dos metais básicos Fe e Ni em catalisadores à base de Pd e Ru, destinados à hidrodescloração do pentaclorofenol em fase líquida. Para tanto, catalisadores monometálicos e bimetálicos, suportados em alumina (Al 2 O 3) ou titânia (TiO 2), foram preparados a partir dos precursores clorados, através do método de co-impregnação a seco. Os sólidos obtidos foram caracterizados por meio das técnicas de adsorção de N 2 (método BET), microscopia eletrônica de varredura com espectrometria de energia dispersiva de raios-X (MEV-EDX), espectroscopia fotoeletrônica de raios-X (XPS), redução à temperatura programada (TPR) e microscopia eletrônica de transmissão (MET). A hidrodescloração do pentaclorofenol foi conduzida num reator Parr® do tipo "slurry", à temperatura de 383 K e sob pressão de H 2 de 0, 5 MPa. Na reação de interesse, a adição de Ni ao catalisador de Ru/TiO 2 diminui a atividade catalítica, porém mantém a elevada seletividade de cicloexanol, possibilitando, portanto, uma diminuição do custo do catalisador, sem perda de seletividade. Já para o catalisador de Pd/TiO 2, a presença de Ni também diminui a atividade catalítica, assim como observado no caso do catalisador de Ru/TiO 2, mas verifica-se uma diminuição da seletividade de fenol. Por sua vez, a adição de Fe ao catalisador de Pd/TiO 2 tem pouca influência sobre a atividade e a seletividade, possibilitando, assim, uma significativa diminuição do custo do catalisador, sem prejuízo do desempenho catalítico. Os comportamentos catalíticos observados são analisados e interpretados à luz dos resultados obtidos através das caracterizações dos sólidos, assim como das informações disponíveis na literaturaSome <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> are {{of great}} concern, {{because of high}} {{toxicity}} and persistence, both the environment and in living organisms. Among these compounds, is the pentachlorophenol, {{which is used to}} Wood conservation and for the protection of crops. A very promising technology to treating this class of toxic compounds is the catalytic hydrodechlorination, through which it is possible the recovery of raw material used in the synthesis of the contaminant. Although various catalysts may be used in this reaction, we highlight the solids Pd and Ru, mainly due to higher catalytic activity. However, the high prices of these noble etals can increase significantly the process costs. In this context, the objective of this work is to study the effects of base metals addition, Fe and Ni, in the catalysts based on Pd and Ru, for the pentachlorophenol hydrodechlorination in liquid phase. For this, monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, supported in alumina (Al 2 O 3) or titanium oxide (TiO 2), were prepared from chlorinated precursors by the incipient impregnation method. The obtained solids were characterized by techniques of N 2 adsorption (BET method), scanning electronic microscopy with X-ray spectrometry analysis (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and transmission electronic microscopy. The pentachlorophenol hydrodechlorination was carried out in a "slurry" Parr® reactor, at the temperature of 373 K under the hydrogen pressure of 0, 5 MPa. In the interest reaction, the addition of Ni to the Ru/TiO 2 catalysts reduces the catalytic activity, but the high cyclohexanol selectivity is maintained, enabling thus, decrease the catalyst cost, without loss of selectivity. To the Pd/TiO 2 catalyst, the i presence reduce the catalytic activity, like to the observed to the Ru/TiO 2 case, but is verified the decreasing of phenol selectivity. In turn, the Fe addition to the Pd/TiO 2 catalyst has little influence on the activity and selectivity, leading thus to a significant decrease in the catalyst cost, without prejudice to the catalytic performance. The observed catalytic behaviors are analyzed and interpreted based in the results obtained through the characterization of solids, as well as information available in the literatur...|$|R

A multiple linear regression analysis performed on the dataset indicated that retention of organochlorine in soils is related to the organic carbon content, Cl input and soil pH...|$|R

The sludge solids were evaluated for Adsorbable organic halide (AOX) in static benthal deposits {{as a function of}} overlying water and the reduction in organic loading on static benthal sludges was compared with the resuspended and completely mixed deposits. <b>Organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> on the sludge was most effectively reduced under full strength Kraft wastewater. There were no significant increases in inorganic chloride content in the overall system in spite of decrease in total <b>organic</b> <b>chlorine.</b> The sum of sludge, water and gas-phase halides was not constant across the sludge/water system but decreased by at least 50 % in each of the reactors...|$|R

40|$|Reactive <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> are {{an often}} {{overlooked}} group of compounds {{that may have}} played a catalyst role in tropospheric ozone formation in the Houston area. In the Houston area an ozone episode occurred in August of 1993, when an alkane-rich hydrocarbon plume passed over anthropogenic sources of molecular chlorine (Cl 2). Although the troposphere contains over 200 reactive chlorine gases, eight of them have been reported to constitute a majority of the tropospheric chlorine burden. To investigate the importance of <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> in the atmospheric chemistry of ozone non-attainment areas in Texas, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) is conducting a series of inventories and atmospheric modeling studies for reactive chlorine emissions. As a component of these TNRCC studies, Eastern Research Group (ERG) developed an inventory methodology for reactive chlorine emissions from mobile and area sources, and conducted an emission inventory for Southeastern Texas to demonstrate the methodology. Some of the sources that were inventoried by ERG included swimming pools, commercial cooling towers, laundry bleach, sea salt aerosols and crustal dust chlorine.

40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the flow of}} toxic materials through industry and into the environment {{is one of the major}} tasks for the IIASA Study, "The Future Environments for Europe: Some Implications, of Alternative Development Paths". Toxic chemicals represent a great threat to the environment, and yet they are commonly used in industrial societies. A sustainable development path would require that usage and disposal of toxic chemicals be compatible with the long-term health of humans and the natural environment. Examining the current and past flows of these materials is a starting point for understanding options for management of their use and disposal, and the impact these options might have on the economy and society. The method chosen to analyze this problem is a materials balance approach in which toxic chemicals are traced as they move through the industrial economy; from extraction to production to intermediate uses and finally to end uses. The methodology and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed in some detail in Chapter 2. The implementation of this approach will become apparent in Chapters 3 through 6 as four individual chemical elements are studied. The four elements examined are bromine, chlorine, sulfur and nitrogen. These chemicals were chosen from a list of 15 which were of particular interest because of the exceptional biological activity of many of the compounds derived from them. The major goal of the project was to develop process-product flow diagrams for these elements showing their pathways through the industrial economy. Each of Chapters 3 through 6 contains a discussion of production processes, major uses, process-product flow diagram(s) and an Appendix with detailed information about the chemical transformations involved in each of the processes. In addition, further investigations including quantitative analysis and discussions of the applicability of this approach for a given element are included in some of the Chapters. Chapter 3, Bromine, presents a detailed qualitative material balance and a more aggregated quantitative material balance for the Netherlands and the United States for 1978 and 1985. The selection of these two countries was based solely on available data. Although the U. S. is not formally part of the study, it is useful as it more closely represents the Western European consumption pattern on average than the Netherlands. While the quantitative analysis focuses only on two countries for two years, it does demonstrate both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the material balance approach. Bromine consumption is an interesting case as it has been heavily impacted by the phase-out of leaded gasoline and strong market shifts are expected in the future. Chapter 4, Chlorine, presents an in-depth qualitative materials balance and a look at the pathways of chlorine into the environment based on its pattern of end-use consumption. Currently, millions of tons of chlorine are produced each year for use as a disinfectant and in the organic and inorganic chemical industries. Many of the end-uses of chlorine result in eventual releases into the environment of various compounds which have a significant effect on environmental quality. <b>Organic</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>compounds</b> are of great use to man because they are not readily biodegradable and they are chemically stable. However, because of these qualities they represent some of the most difficult disposal problems of any anthropogenic material. Chapter 5, Sulfur, presents a thorough qualitative analysis of the industrial processes and an in-depth discussion of the applicability of the materials balance approach to sulfur. A large portion of anthropogenically mobilized sulfur is from the burning of fossil fuels and the smelting of ores, two processes where sulfur is not an intentional product, simply an unavoidable one. The bulk of scientific study of sulfur wastes is concentrated on these areas due to their contribution to the acid rain problem. The analysis presented here shows that over half of the total anthropogenic sulfur budget in Europe is from industrial sources other than fossil fuels and ore smelting. This is a fairly surprising result. Thus, the flow of sulfur through the industrial economy in Europe is significant and greater {{understanding of}} the eventual disposal of this sulfur is needed. In addition, sulfuric acid is the number one industrial chemical based on the tonnage of production. It is used in a myriad of industries where it is generally consumed in the process and not embodied in the end product. This presents difficulties in the implementation of the materials balance analysis for sulfur. Chapter 6, Nitrogen, presents the process-product flow diagram for nitrogen. About 95...|$|R
