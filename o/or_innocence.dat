5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes a position on the guilt <b>or</b> <b>innocence</b> of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E

One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced to swallow a poison to determine their guilt <b>or</b> <b>innocence.</b> Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt <b>or</b> <b>innocence</b> and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
