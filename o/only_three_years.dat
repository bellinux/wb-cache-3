5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought {{it would be easier to}} pronounce.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 an {{exceptionally}} strong composite of aluminium oxide and silicon carbide whiskers was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite {{to a commercial}} product took <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and silicon carbide whisker-reinforced composite {{were introduced to the}} market.|$|E
50|$|On 23 July Wings of Desire was the <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>year</b> old colt {{to take on}} {{the older}} horses in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and was {{installed}} the 4/1 3rd favourite behind Hong Kong Vase winner Highland Reel and Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. As the <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>year</b> old in the field he was claiming 12 pounds {{from the rest of the}} field and was expected to improve from his Epsom Derby run on only his fifth start ever. Wings of Desire settled in second behind Highland Reel for most the race and chased him down the straight but was unable to get past being beaten just over a length with the pair 3 lengths clear of Hardwicke Stakes winner Dartmouth in third.|$|R

50|$|When Aslaug {{heard the}} news of Eric and Agnar's death, she cried blood, and asked Ragnar's sons to avenge their dead {{brothers}}. Ivar the Boneless {{was afraid of the}} magic that ruled in Sweden, but when his little brother, the <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>year</b> old Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye wanted to attack Eysteinn, the brothers changed their minds.|$|R
5|$|Low captained {{a number}} of ships, usually {{maintaining}} a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured {{at least a hundred}} ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> Low remains notorious {{as one of the most}} vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before murdering them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a handful}} of men reached Illinois Country, help {{never made it to}} the fort. Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E

5|$|Baith Israel Anshei Emes's move to egalitarianism {{culminated in}} August 1988, when Debra Cantor {{was hired as}} its first female rabbi, making it the first synagogue in the Northeastern United States to be led by a woman. Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been valedictorian of that year's graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. The {{decision}} was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative movement had ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, MD71 was {{involved}} in a three-route number change involving highways in three different areas of the state. MD71 was reassigned to the Blue Star Memorial Highway then under construction from Queenstown to the Delaware state line; this designation lasted <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> before U.S.Route301 was rerouted onto the highway in 1959. MD71 was designated MD194 to match the adjacent numbered highway in Pennsylvania. MD194 had previously been assigned to Flower Avenue in Takoma Park; Flower Avenue was then designated MD787.|$|E

5|$|Later {{the same}} month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup after {{defeating}} Porto 2–0 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Cesc Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's {{total amount of}} official trophies. The Super Cup victory also marked another impressive achievement as Pep Guardiola won his 12th trophy out of 15 possible in <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> {{at the helm of}} the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|On taking office, Welensky {{was forced}} to take sides in the Suez Crisis. The {{government}} of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics. In {{the aftermath of the}} Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} prestigious clubs in Australia was the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), which was formed in 1838, <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after the {{founding}} of Melbourne. The MCC dominated cricket in Australia {{for the rest of the}} century. Although club membership was intended for the social elite, similar to that of leading English clubs at the time, its ability to secure the best cricketers in its teams made it enormously popular with spectators; the intention of the MCC seems to have been to spread cricket's popularity in a similar way to the Marylebone Cricket Club's efforts in England.|$|E

5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously served <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> in the Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently {{to ensure}} {{the success of the}} shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the only state governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by Richard Hawes, the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Gefion {{initially}} {{served with}} the main German fleet and frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern on trips to other European countries, including a state visit to Russia in 1897. In late 1897, Gefion was reassigned to the East Asia Squadron; she arrived there in May 1898. The ship {{took part in the}} Battle of Taku Forts in June 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China. She returned to Germany in 1901 and was modernized, but she did not return to service after the work was finished in 1904. She was to be mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but a crew could not be assembled due to shortages of personnel. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship in Danzig from 1916 {{to the end of the}} war. In 1920, she was sold, converted into a freighter, and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld. She served in this capacity for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> and was broken up for scrap in Danzig in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Homer gets a {{magazine}} loaded with personality tests and quizzes {{his friends and}} family with them. Later on, he takes his own test which reveals that has <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> left to live. Terrified of his supposedly impending death, he develops insomnia and goes insane. Homer visits the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's psychiatrist, who suggests that he take a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to Florida and find themselves {{in the middle of a}} raucous spring break when they get there. Marge wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attends a concert featuring Joe C. and Kid Rock. Homer becomes the life of spring break until it ends and the wild college students return to their studies.|$|E

5|$|In 1719 the Duke and Duchess {{were able}} {{to move into the}} east wing of the {{unfinished}} palace, but Marlborough had <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> to enjoy it. While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in the vault at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side lying in the vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{news of the}} {{situation}} in the West Indies forced the authorities to take action. During the autumn of 1808, a number of ships were despatched carrying much needed food and military supplies, but several were intercepted, including the frigate Thétis, captured during the Action of 10 November 1808 in the Bay of Biscay. Despite the losses, some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared, including the frigate Topaze, ordered to transport 1,100 barrels of flour to Cayenne. The cargo was loaded during late November and early December, the frigate also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison. The ship, under the command of Captain Pierre-Nicolas Lahalle, was <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> old and carried 40 heavy guns.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
