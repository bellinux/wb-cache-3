5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.|$|E
5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the target value is less than <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. Grunting and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E

5|$|The Second Constitutional Settlement was {{completed}} in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare, or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius, or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13BC.|$|E
