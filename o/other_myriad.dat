After a single negative experience, users tend to switch to one of the <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> of alterna tives available to them on the Internet. Two key compon ents of Internet application quality are scalability and reli ability. In this paper, we present the first general-purpose mechanism capable of maintaining reliability in the face of process, machine, and catastrophic failures. We define catastrophic failures as events that cause entire clusters of servers to become unavailable such as network partition ing, router failures, natural disasters, or even terrorist at tacks. Our mechanism utilizes client-side tunneling, client-side redirection, and implicit redirection triggers to deliver reliable communication channels. We capitalize on previ ous work, Redirectable Sockets (RedSocks), that focuses on Internet application scalability. RedSocks are communica tion channels enhanced with a novel session layer aimed at modernizing network communication. We modify Red-Socks to create the first fault tolerant socket solution that can handle all server-side failures. Our mechanism is com patible with NATs and Firewalls, scalable, application in dependent, and backwards compatible. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Governmental {{mandates}} {{and public}} awareness have forced progressively smaller and less sophisticated agencies and organizations to initiate stream monitoring programs, particularly in urban and urbanizing areas. Yet {{many of these}} monitoring efforts lack either a coherent conceptual framework or appropriately chosen methods, and they rely on monitoring techniques that are simply infeasible for these institutional settings. We propose a monitoring strategy, and specific existing monitoring protocols, that will be useful for the management and rehabilitation of streams in ur-banizing watersheds. A monitoring strategy must be developed by 1) identifying the management question(s) being addressed, 2) determining the institional level of effort required (and available) to effectively make particular kinds of measurements, and 3) identifying what specific parameters should and can be measured. Only a limited set of parameters show much utility or feasibility in addressing the most common management questions being faced by municipalities in urbanizing, humid-area regions of the United States. These include measures of riparian canopy, bank erosion and bank hardening, and in-stream large woody debris. With some additional expertise useful data can also be included on channel gradient, substrate composition, and pools. Nearly all of the <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> parameters that have been measured historically on rivers and streams show little apparent value in these watershed and institutional settings...|$|E

Finally, recommendations are put forth, on how best to overcome these barriers and further improve the effectiveness of its use. The research is carried out via interviews with front end users and managers involved with its deployment and everyday use. The data generated and the analysis conducted leads to the conclusion that 4 D CAD as a tool is indeed valuable and can {{have a positive impact on}} projects, but these benefits come only where it is used appropriately...|$|E
40|$|Malaysian Public Universities are {{undergoing}} {{the process of}} transformation which requires efforts from every components of the universities, especially the academic staffs, {{in order to achieve}} high rankings internationally and to fulfill their key performance indicator for the purpose of promotion and appraisal. These ambitions have increased the workload of academic staffs and extend their workloads from teaching to <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> of responsibilities such as; research, consultation, administrative works and community services. In light of this, the benefits received by the academic staffs are disproportionate with their workloads. This research examines the relationship between transformation of higher education status, the workload of academic staff and the proportionality of benefit allocated to them. Data was collected through interview with the top level management from four different categories of universities such as Accelerated Program for Excellence, Research, Focused and Comprehensive University. Thematic content data analysis technique was employed in analyzing the data collected. The findings shows that the transformation of higher education status has intricate the workloads of academic staffs with less benefits. The workloads and job specifications of the academic staffs are different in accordance to the categories of the universities. Meanwhile, all public universities are bound to follow the standard scheme provided by the Public Service Department of Malaysia. This study suggests that the contract of service of academic staffs be revised to include clear terms on the improvement of scheme and benefits for academic staffs in public universities...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play pivotal {{roles in}} {{regulating}} various cellular functions. It {{has been well}} established that GPCR activates NF-κB and aberrant regulation of GPCR-NF-κB signaling axis leads to cancers. However, how GPCRs induce NF-κB activation remains largely elusive. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that a novel scaffold protein, CARMA 3, is indispensable in GPCR-induced NF-κB activation. In CARMA 3 -deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, some GPCR ligand-, like lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), induced NF-κB activation is completely abolished. Mechanistically, upon GPCR activation, CARMA 3 is linked to the membrane by β-arrestin 2 and phosphorylated by some PKC isoform. Phosphorylation of CARMA 3 unfolds its steric structure and recruits its downstream effectors, which in turn activate the IKK complex and NF-κB. Interestingly, GPCR (LPA) -CARMA 3 -NF-κB signaling axis also exists in ovarian cancer cells, and knockdown of CARMA 3 results in attenuation of ovarian cancer migration and invasion, suggesting a novel target for cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the biology of CARMA 3, discuss the GPCR (LPA) -CARMA 3 -NF-κB signaling axis in ovarian cancer and speculate its potential role in other types of cancers. With a strongly increasing tendency to identify more LPA-like ligands, such as endothelin- 1 and angiotensin II, which also activate NF-κB through CARMA 3 and contribute to myriad diseases, GPCR- CARMA 3 -NF-κB signaling axis is emerging as a novel drug target for various types of cancer and <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> diseases...|$|E

40|$|Ananda Devi [1957 -], a French-language {{author and}} poet from Mauritius, adds depth to the lyricism already {{inherent}} in her writing by drawing upon that country 2 ̆ 7 s multicultural heritage, which includes African, Hindu, and French, and its Creole language. Le Long Désir (2003) defies genre, being neither strictly poetry nor prose, and presents more {{a collection of}} prose poems than a structured story with a tangible plot. The poetic aspect of her text, accomplished through this Creole as well as experimentation with grammatical structures and the display of the text on the page, inclines me as a translator to prioritize the lyricism of her text over its content, though cer-tainly I have endeavored to bring both into my English translation of selected sections of the book. Its unifying theme of the struggle of women with violence, anguish and self-definition is brought to the fore by running motifs of animalistic behavior, putrefaction, and darkness, which are accompanied by equally vivid instances of fragility and beauty, signaling the plurality of the situation of women.

40|$|In September 2004, {{the opening}} of the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington DC {{provided}} the nation with another opportunity to self-narrate on both sub-national and national levels. For many Native and non-Native peoples, the newest Smithsonian Institution represented not only a new method of museological practice based on self-governance and representation but also that Native America existed prior to European Contact, continues today and is worthy of being understood as both part and precursor of a larger collective identity of the nation. This occurred with the museum's successful Mitsitam Cafe whereby American cuisine was defined with a Native genesis. The landscape, as well, was scripted as begin original to the northeastern habitat of the United States, in contrast to the Beaux-Arts inspired landscapes of Europe which define the rest of the National Mall. A sensory engagement with both the Cafe and landscaped grounds, moreover, would separate this particular museal space- intended to be a Native place- from its neighbors. How the senses attend to an engagement with the museum is central to the planning behind the institution- as well as my analysis- whereby the sensorium is mediated both for public consumption and to meeting particular ideological ends. At the same time that Native America is re-presented in our nation's capital, however, sub-national agendas are continually negotiated by the nation-state, whether aligned or not. Historically the museum may be conceived as an instrument of pedagogy and nationalist promulgation and the new Indian museum is no exception. Allowed to self-represent, the NMAI is subsequently re-scripted by a larger agendafashioned on an inherited Euro-American discourse- that ultimately privileges the nation and nation-making over subaltern demands. As the National Mall is poised to receive a new museum on the African American experience one also recognizes how America's Lawn is rooted in spatial practices and narrative techniques of World Expositions in 19 th century America and Europe, further complicating the institution. These and <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> tensions have challenged the Native-inspired museum and this contested space, {{in the shadow of the}} nation's capitol, continues to be defined on shifting terms of national self-imagining. Designed to broadcast pan-tribal Native voices, the museum continues to harbor other historically inherited voices that destabilize the mission the institution aspires to achieve...|$|E
40|$|To date, adult {{educational}} research {{has had a}} limited focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) adults and the learning processes in which they engage across the life course. Adopting a biographical and life history methodology, this study aimed to critically explore the potentially distinctive nature and impact of how, when and where LGBT adults learn to construct their identities over their lives. In-depth, semi-structured interviews, dialogue and discussion with LGBT individuals and groups provided rich narratives that reflect shifting, diverse and multiple ways of identifying and living as LGBT. Participants engage in learning in unique ways that {{play a significant role}} in the construction and expression of such identities, that in turn influence how, when and where learning happens. Framed largely by complex heteronormative forces, learning can have a negative, distortive impact that deeply troubles any balanced, positive sense of being LGBT, leading to self- censoring, alienation and in some cases, hopelessness. However, learning is also more positively experiential, critically reflective, inventive and queer in nature. This can transform how participants understand their sexual identities and the lifewide spaces in which they learn, engendering agency and resilience. Intersectional perspectives reveal learning that participants struggle with, but can reconcile the disjuncture between evolving LGBT and <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> identities as parents, Christians, teachers, nurses, academics, activists and retirees. The study’s main contributions lie in three areas. A focus on LGBT experience can contribute to the creation of new opportunities to develop intergenerational learning processes. The study also extends the possibilities for greater criticality in older adult education theory, research and practice, based on the continued, rich learning in which participants engage post-work and in later life. Combined with this, there is scope to further explore the nature of ‘life-deep learning’ for other societal groups, brought by combined religious, moral, ideological and social learning that guides action, beliefs, values, and expression of identity. The LGBT adults in this study demonstrate engagement in distinct forms of life-deep learning to navigate social and moral opprobrium. From this they gain hope, self-respect, empathy with others, and deeper self-knowledge...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the potential for}} the application of distributed computing frameworks to industrial and also lightweight consumer-level Machine Vision (MV) applications. Traditional, stand-alone MV systems have many benefits in well-defined, tightly- controlled industrial settings, but expose limitations in interactive, de-localised and small-task applications that seek to utilise vision techniques. In these situations, single-computer solutions fail to suffice and greater flexibility in terms of system construction, interactivity and localisation are required. Network-connected and distributed vision systems are proposed as a remedy to these problems, providing dynamic, componentised systems that may optionally be independent of location, or take advantage of networked computing tools and techniques, such as web servers, databases, proxies, wireless networking, secure connectivity, distributed computing clusters, web services and load balancing. The thesis discusses a system named Myriad, a distributed computing framework for Machine Vision applications. Myriad is composed components, such as image processing engines and equipment controllers, which behave as enhanced web servers and communicate using simple HTTP requests. The roles of HTTP-based distributed computing servers in simplifying rapid development of networked applications and integrating those applications with existing networked tools and business processes are explored. Prototypes of Myriad components, written in Java, along with supporting PHP, Perl and Prolog scripts and user interfaces in C, Java, VB and C++/Qt are examined. Each component includes a scripting language named MCS, enabling remote clients (or <b>other</b> <b>Myriad</b> components) to issue single commands or execute sequences of commands locally to the component in a sustained session. The advantages of server- side scripting in this manner for distributed computing tasks are outlined with emphasis on Machine Vision applications, as a means to overcome network connection issues and address problems where consistent processing is required. Furthermore, the opportunities to utilise scripting to form complex distributed computing network topologies and fully-autonomous federated networked applications are described, and examples given on how to achieve functionality such as clusters of image processing nodes. Through the medium of experimentation involving the remote control of a model train set, cameras and lights, the ability of Myriad to perform traditional roles of fixed, stand-alone Machine Vision systems is supported, along with discussion of opportunities to incorporate these elements into network-based dynamic collaborative inspection applications. In an example of 2 D packing of remotely-acquired shapes, distributed computing extensions to Machine Vision tasks are explored, along with integration into larger business processes. Finally, the thesis {{examines the}} use of Machine Vision techniques and Myriad components to construct distributed computing applications with the addition of vision capabilities, leading to a new class of image-data-driven applications that exploit mobile computing and Pervasive Computing trends...|$|E

The care of the sick, the injured, the dying may be {{the function of the}} hospital, but {{it is the responsibility of}} every citizen. Unionists are citizens first and unionists second. As a citizen, the unionist knows that the collective bargaining of the commercial enter-prise cannot be transplanted to the hospital. The constructive right to strike, the bedrock of union life and power can be self-destructive. Slowdowns, work stoppages in a hospital can become matters of life and death. No responsible unionist can, there-fore 3 talk of strikes or slowdowns in relation to hospitals. Collective bargaining itself assumes a different meaning in the hospital atmosphere. In the commercial enterprise, production pace, assignment of work and the many <b>other</b> <b>myriad</b> aspects of profit making are open to discussion between management and union. There is little parallel in the hospital. This is the problem. TJith the growth of unions in the community and the benefits of dignity and security which unionism bestows upon the 0 union member, the hospital employee naturally seeks the same status and in the same manner. On the other hand, the hospital is not comparable to the shop, the factory, the warehouse, the retail store. Union leadership in Toledo feels that reasonable men acting as citizens first and managers and unionists second can resolve this problem. It is further hoped that J| this may be a Toledo contJribution to the national problem of unionization of hospitals.
