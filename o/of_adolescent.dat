40|$|Our {{objectives}} were to compare adolescent and parent {{ratings of the}} health-related quality of life (HRQL) <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> treated for cancer, to compare the HRQL <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> who were on treatment vs. the HRQL {{of those who were}} off treatment following their diagnosis with cancer and to assess the HRQL <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> who were at different points of time following their diagnosis with cancer. The HRQL <b>of</b> 70 <b>adolescents</b> (aged 10 to 18 years) consecutively attending the Women's and Children's Hospital Oncology Clinic in South Australia was assessed by means of standard questionnaires. Parents completed the Child Health Questionnaire, the Functional Status II(R) Questionnaire and the Impact-on-Family Scale. Adolescents completed the self-report version of the Child Health Questionnaire. In general, there was good agreement between parent and adolescent reports. However, parents <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> receiving active treatment for cancer reported that their illness was having a greater impact on the adolescents' physical functioning than was reported by the adolescents. The psycho-social functioning <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> in single-parent families was reported also by parents to be worse than that <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> in 2 -parent families. The physical functioning <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> had only a weak relationship with parental status but a significant relationship with treatment status. Despite generally good agreement between parent and adolescent reports describing the HRQL <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> treated for cancer, it cannot be assumed that reports from parents are always an accurate reflection of the views <b>of</b> the <b>adolescents.</b> Studies examining the influence of independent factors on adolescents' HRQL must take into account differences in reports from these 2 informants and the possibility that key independent variables have differing relationships with the various domains which comprise adolescents' HRQL.

5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. In {{the past}} few decades {{adolescents}} have become sexually active on a younger age. This may result in risk behaviours such as drug use and delinquent behaviour. Parents and peers can {{play a role in the}} sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The goal <b>of</b> the present study is to examine the relationship between parents and peers, and the sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The focus will be on psychological control, behavioural control, sexual communication with parents and peers, sexual attitudes of parents and peers, peer pressure, and sexual experiences of peers. Method. Data of a longitudinal study has been used for the present study. A total of 1297 participants from four high schools provided information through online questionnaires. Regression analyses have been used to examine the relationship between the concepts and sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Results. Psychological control, sexual communication with parents and peers, sexual attitudes with parents and peers, and sexual experiences of peers were associated with sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> However, the psychological control and sexual attitudes of parents associations were weak. No association was found between behavioural control, peer pressure and sexual experience <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Sexual communication with peers was the best predictor for sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Conclusion.

Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention <b>of</b> <b>adolescent</b> criminals.

The amount and nature of time spent caring for adolescents {{with and without disabilities}} may vary (Crowe & Michael, 2010). This qualitative study describes the differences between the occupational performance goals <b>of</b> mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> with disabilities and mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> without disabilities. Methods: A sample of 20 mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> with disabilities and 20 mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> without disabilities was recruited. Adolescents had to be between 13 and 19 years of age and identified by the mother as having a disability or no disability. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (Law et al., 2005) was used to gather narrative information from the mothers in a semi-structured interview format. The data was then qualitatively analyzed and compared. 	 Results: Using grounded theory and thematic coding, the data was organized into six themes describing the mothers’ occupational performance goals. Five of the six themes were shared between both groups, with minor differences {{in the nature of the}} identified occupations. However, only mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> with disabilities identified goals concerning supporting their adolescents. Conclusions: The findings highlight the difference in the nature of occupational performance goals between mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> with disabilities and mothers <b>of</b> <b>adolescents</b> without disabilities. While similarities exist between the two groups, it is important to understand the different demands <b>of</b> mothering <b>adolescents</b> with disabilities to better support them in their daily occupations.
