50|$|Traffic signal {{preemption}} systems sometimes {{include a}} method for communicating to the <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> that requested the preemption (as well as other drivers) that a traffic signal is under control of a preemption device, {{by means of a}} notifier. This device is almost always an additional light located near the traffic signals. It may be a single light bulb visible to all, which flashes or stays on, or there may be a light aimed towards each direction from which traffic approaches the intersection. In the case of multiple notifier lights at a controllable intersection, they will either flash or stay on depending on the local configuration, to communicate to all drivers from which direction a preempting signal is being received. This informs regular drivers which direction may need to be cleared, and informs activating vehicle drivers if they have control of the light (especially important when more than one activating vehicle approaches the same intersection). A typical installation would provide a solid notifier to indicate that an activating vehicle is approaching from behind, while a flashing notifier would indicate the emergency vehicle is approaching laterally or oncoming. There are variations of notification methods in use, which may include one or more colored lights in varying configurations.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for intelligent path prediction, predicting {{the motion of}} an observed vehicle by reasoning about the actions taken by the <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The thesis considers only the problem of tracking a vehicle performing a transit mission, a mission that proceeds from a start location to a goal location guided by an intelligent planning criterion. Intelligent planning criteria are modeled by generalized cost criteria, which allow for basis cost criterion, for example, distance, visibility, or safety, to be considered, or convex combinations of such basis cost criteria to be considered. Two main investigations are addressed. ^ The first investigation {{is to develop a}} method for identifying a decision-making strategy that seemingly explains the observed vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s motion. The start location is assumed to be known, the goal location is assumed to be in a given set of candidate goal locations, and an intelligent planning criterion is assumed to be guiding the vehicle. Given the history of the observed vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s path, the objectives are to (1) select the cost criterion that best explains the observed motion, (2) predict the goal location of the vehicle, and (3) predict the future path leading to the goal location. In solving this problem, search pointer information provided by reverse graph searches is exploited. Best fitting a goal location and cost criterion pair to explain the decision-making strategy of the vehicle is accomplished through a path similarity correlation measure comparing the observed path data to search gradient direction information. ^ The second investigation is to develop a method of automatically proposing a candidate goal location for the observed vehicle. Given the cost criteria that best explains the history of the observed vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s path, the objectives are to (1) propose a region of plausible goal locations and (2) rank the locations in the set of plausible goal locations based on some heuristic merit. In solving this problem, search pointer information provided by forward graph searches is exploited. Establishing the region of plausible goal locations is accomplished using search tree results. Finally, the region of plausible goal locations is analyzed to rank the locations based on heuristic merit. ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{civil and}} {{military}} applications of UAVs, or ground robots, require {{a set of}} vehicles to monitor a group of targets. Routing problems naturally arise in this setting where <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> have to plan the paths suitably in order to optimize <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> resources available such as sensors, fuel etc. These vehicles may differ either in their structural (design and dynamics) or functional (sensing) capabilities. This thesis addresses an important routing problem involving two heterogeneous <b>vehicles.</b> As <b>the</b> addressed routing problem is NP-Hard, we develop an approximation algorithm and heuristics to solve the problem. Our approach involves dividing the routing problem into two sub-problems: Partitioning and Sequencing. Partitioning the targets involves finding two distinct sets of targets, each corresponding to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We then find a sequence in which these targets need to be visited in order to optimize <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> resources to <b>the</b> maximum possible extent. The sequencing problem can be solved either by Christofides algorithm or the Lin-Kernighan Heuristic (LKH). <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> partitioning is tackled by solving a Linear Program (LP) obtained by relaxing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constraints <b>of</b> an Integer Programming (IP) model for the problem. We observe <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> two LP models for the partitioning. The first LP model is obtained by relaxing only the integrality constraints whereas in the second model relaxes both integrality and degree constraints. The algorithms were implemented in a C++ environment with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> Concert Technology for CPLEX, and Boost Graph Libraries. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> these algorithms was studied for 50 random instances of varying problem sizes. It was found that on an average, the algorithms based on the first LP model provided better (closer to the optimum) solutions as compared to those based on the second LP model. We also observed that for both the LP models, <b>the</b> average quality <b>of</b> solutions given by the heuristics {{were found to be}} better (within 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimum) than <b>the</b> average quality <b>of</b> solutions obtained from the approximation algorithm (between 30 - 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimum depending on the problem size) ...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{equipped with}} integrity augmentation systems offer the potential to increase safety, efficiency and sustainability of airport ground operations. The model predictive behaviour of these systems supports a timely detection of any deviations from the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), producing useful alerts for onboard mission management. Firstly, <b>the</b> system architecture <b>of</b> a Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) for autonomous airport surface vehicle operations based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements is described. Subsequently, an integrity augmentation module is implemented in the NGS by modeling the key GNSS signal degradation phenomena including masking, multipath and signal attenuation. The GNSS integrity augmentation system is capable <b>of</b> monitoring <b>the</b> RNP and alerting <b>the</b> remote <b>operator</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airport surface <b>vehicle.</b> <b>The</b> uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presented system is that both caution and warning flags are produced based on prediction-avoidance and reaction-correction capabilities respectively. Additionally, the system is capable of issuing suitable steering commands to the onboard mission management system/remote ground base station <b>operator</b> in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> GNSS signal degradations or losses. Multipath is modelled in detail using a ray tracing algorithm and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> position error is computed {{as a function of}} relative geometry between the satellites, receiver antenna and reflectors in realistic airport operation scenarios. Additionally, <b>the</b> surface <b>vehicle</b> dynamics and reflective surfaces of buildings are modelled in order to simulate a vehicle trajectory through a typical airport airside/aprons environment. Simulation case studies are performed to validate the mathematical models developed for the integrity augmentation system and the results corroborate <b>the</b> suitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed system to generate useful and timely integrity flags when GNSS is used as <b>the</b> primary means <b>of</b> navigation...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity (AVTA), {{along with}} Electric Transportation Applications and Arizona Pubic Service (APS), is {{monitoring}} <b>the</b> operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> APS Alternative Fuel (Hydrogen) Pilot Plant {{to determine the}} costs to produce hydrogen fuels (including 100 % hydrogen as well as hydrogen and compressed natural gas blends) for use by fleets and other <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> advanced-technology <b>vehicles.</b> <b>The</b> hydrogen fuel cost data {{will be used as}} benchmark data by technology modelers as well as research and development programs. The Pilot Plant can produce up to 18 kilograms (kg) of hydrogen per day by electrolysis. It can store up to 155 kg of hydrogen at various pressures up to 6, 000 psi. The dispenser island can fuel vehicles with 100 % hydrogen at 5, 000 psi and with blends of hydrogen and compressed natural gas at 3, 600 psi. The monitoring system was designed to track hydrogen delivery to each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three storage areas and to monitor <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> electricity on all major equipment in the Pilot Plant, including the fuel dispenser island. In addition, water used for the electrolysis process is monitored to allow calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total cost <b>of</b> plant operations and plant efficiencies. The monitoring system at the Pilot Plant will include about 100 sensors when complete (50 are installed to date), allowing for analysis of component, subsystems, and plant-level costs. The monitoring software is mostly off-the-shelve, with a custom interface. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensors input to the Programmable Automation Controller as 4 - to 20 -mA analog signals. The plant can be monitored over <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet, but the control functions are restricted to the control room equipment. Using the APS general service plan E 32 electric rate of 2. 105 cents per kWh, during a recent eight-month period when 1, 200 kg of hydrogen was produced and the plant capacity factor was 26 %, the electricity cost to produce one kg of hydrogen was $ 3. 43. However, the plant capacity factor has been increasing, with a recent one-month high of 49 %. If a plant capacity factor of 70 % can be achieved with the present equipment, <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> electricity would drop to $ 2. 39 per kg of hydrogen. In this report, the power conversion (76. 7 %), cell stack (53. 1 %), and reverse osmosis system (7. 14 %) efficiencies are also calculated, as is the water cost per kg of hydrogen produced ($ 0. 10 per kg). The monitoring system has identified several areas having the potential to lower costs, including using an reverse osmosis system with a higher efficiency, improving the electrolysis power conversion efficiency, and using air cooling to replace some or all chiller cooling. These activities are managed by the Idaho National Laboratory for the AVTA, which is part of DOE’s FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program...|$|R
