30|$|A {{simulation}} method {{as described in}} [4] has been followed, and the components soldering results have been contrasted with polarimeter stress measurements in order to investigate the <b>optimization</b> <b>and</b> <b>miniaturization</b> <b>of</b> laser components packaged with the solderjet bumping technique. The goal was to draw a distinction for cases at which the resulting beam depolarization reached values higher than 1 %. We found that the solderjet bumping technique showed much better results than the maximum expected results in all analyzed cases. In the study, we could simulate and solder components down to 300  μm cube sizes, without strongly affecting the laser emission and with bonding strengths that comply with theoretical values. These results affirm solderjet bumping as a reliable technique that is able to assemble components down to the laser beam size (as {{in the case of}} fibers) without strongly affecting the laser beam polarization.|$|E
40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) {{constitute}} {{a family of}} detoxification enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione {{with a variety of}} hydrophobic compounds, including drugs and their metabolites, to yield water-soluble derivatives that are excreted in urine or bile. Profiling the effect of small molecules on GST activity is an important component in the characterization of drug candidates and compound libraries. Additionally, specific GST isozymes have been implicated in drug resistance, especially in cancer, and thus represent potential targets for intervention. To date, there are no sensitive miniaturized high-throughput assays available for GST activity detection. A series of GST substrates containing a masked luciferin moiety have been described recently, offering the potential for configuring a sensitive screening assay via coupled luciferase reaction and standard luminescence detection. We report on the <b>optimization</b> <b>and</b> <b>miniaturization</b> <b>of</b> this homogeneous method to 1, 536 -well format using GSTs from 3 different species: mouse isozyme A 4 - 4, human isozymes A 1 - 1, M 1 - 1, and P 1 - 1, and the major GST from the parasitic worm Schistosoma japonicum...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and specific enzyme inhibition assay based on alcohol oxidase (AlOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for determination of mercury Hg(II) in water samples has been presented. This {{article describes the}} <b>optimization</b> <b>and</b> <b>miniaturization</b> <b>of</b> an enzymatic assay using a chemiluminescence reaction. The analytical performance and detection limit for determination of Hg(II) was optimized in 96 well plates and further extended to 384 well plates with a 10 -fold reduction in assay volume. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by dissolved Hg(II) {{was found to be}} linear in the range 5 – 500 pg. mL− 1 with 3 % CVin inter-batch assay. Due to miniaturization of assay in 384 well plates, Hg(II) was measurable as low as 1 pg. mL− 1 within 15 min. About 10 -fold more specificity of the developed assay for Hg(II) analysis was confirmed by challenging with interfering divalent metal ions such as cadmium Cd(II) and lead Pb(II). Using the proposed assay we could successfully demonstrate that in a composite mixture of Hg(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II), inhibition by each metal ion is significantly enhanced {{in the presence of the}} others. Applicability of the proposed assay for the determination of the Hg(II) in spiked drinking and sea water resulted in recoveries ranging from 100 – 110. 52 %...|$|E
