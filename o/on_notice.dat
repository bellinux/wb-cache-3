5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

When companies began selling gloves, pills, inhalers, diuretics, shampoos and other products during the Swine Flu scare, Schumer urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to open an investigation.

Henry was legitimately injured and was ruled out of the scheduled match between the two at The Great American Bash, thus further delaying a potential feud between the two after being delayed by Batista's initial injury.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, 2009, the Rams offered Incognito {{a one-year}} tender worth $1.01 million, which he signed on May 3. Incognito started all nine {{games in which}} he played for the Rams in 2009. On December 13, {{during the first half}} of a 47–7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Incognito drew two 15-yard {{penalties}} for headbutting Titans players. Head coach Steve Spagnuolo benched him for the second half, and the two got into a heated confrontation on the sidelines. It was the second time Incognito had been benched for losing his composure; he had been pulled from the season opener against Seattle for two personal fouls. However, the Titans incident was the last straw; the Rams waived him two days after the game. In 2013, former Rams general manager Billy Devaney told ESPN that Spagnuolo had given Incognito numerous chances to clean up his act, and had put him <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> that the Rams would cut ties with him if he couldn't control his anger.|$|E

500|$|While {{he was in}} London Belcher {{arranged}} for Lieutenant Governor Dummer {{to be replaced by}} William Tailer (whose appointment to that post in 1715 he had ironically managed to supersede by lobbying for Dummer's appointment), and recommended that Jeremiah Dummer (with whom his relations had become seriously strained) be dismissed as colonial agent. [...] He was well received in Massachusetts upon his arrival in 1731, but immediately began to purge opponents and their supporters from positions over which he had control.

500|$|Justice Kennedy {{rejected}} Drayton's {{argument that}} officers coerced passengers by showing their badges, {{noting that the}} sight of police officers should be a [...] "cause for assurance, not discomfort". Likewise, he rejected the argument that placing an officer near {{the door of the}} bus constituted a seizure, because the officer [...] "did nothing to intimidate passengers" [...] and [...] "left the aisle clear". Justice Kennedy also held that the nature of the encounter did not change after Brown was arrested, because [...] "he arrest of one person does not mean that everyone around him has been seized by police". Rather, witnessing Brown's arrest [...] "should have put Drayton <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> of the consequences of continuing the encounter by answering the officers' questions".|$|E

500|$|A {{key figure}} {{in the end of}} the blacklisting of McCarthyism was John Henry Faulk. Host of an {{afternoon}} comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of communist [...] "disloyalty". Marked by AWARE as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost uniquely among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957 and finally won the case in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> that they were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. Although some informal blacklisting continued, the private [...] "loyalty checking" [...] agencies were soon a thing of the past. Even before the Faulk verdict, many in Hollywood had {{decided it was time to}} break the blacklist. In 1960, Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was publicly credited with writing the films Exodus and Spartacus.|$|E
500|$|The Web site drew media {{attention}} when the Church of Scientology's attorneys Moxon & Kobrin contacted Stollery, claiming the ScienTOMogy domain name was an infringement of their trademark, despite being a different word by one letter.

500|$|Through December, Foraker {{worked to}} try to retain his Senate seat, which {{required}} action by the Ohio legislature in the era before direct election of senators. [...] His rivals were Burton and the President-elect's brother, former congressman Charles Phelps Taft, though {{near the end of}} the contest, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding asked for his name to be considered. Both Foraker and Burton opposed Charles Taft's call for a caucus of the Republican legislators to determine the party's candidate. On December 29, President Roosevelt weighed in on the question. Roosevelt [...] "lost no time in putting the Republican members of the Ohio legislature <b>on</b> <b>notice</b> that to re-elect Mr. Foraker to the Senate would be regarded as nothing less than treason to the party". [...] Roosevelt accused Foraker of seeking to make a bargain with the Democrats to secure his re-election in exchange for a Democratic replacement for Dick in 1911. Faced with this presidential intervention and Charles Taft's withdrawal from the race, Foraker saw no path to victory and conceded on December 31. [...] The Republican caucus two days later selected Burton, whom the legislators duly selected on January 12.|$|E
