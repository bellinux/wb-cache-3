5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> {{in the middle}} order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E
5|$|After being {{aided by}} rain {{while in a}} disadvantageous {{position}} during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over Middlesex—to prepare for the next Test at Headingley. Barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of time, {{and was replaced by}} Neil Harvey. Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated {{the three}} openers {{in the tour}} matches, but Morris and Barnes were {{preferred}} in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle order in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 {{in the first two}} Tests.|$|E

5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects of his game, he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the chance of being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E
5|$|Nowitzki averages {{just over}} one block {{per game and}} never made an All-Defense Team. However, playing more around the {{perimeter}} took him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> where a typical power forward would be detracted from his overall defensive stats. Despite rarely blocking shots, he is ranked 8th in active players for defensive win shares as of July 2014.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 Australia {{team that}} toured England {{has become known}} as The Invincibles, because they did not lose a single game. Following their {{performances}} during the Australian season, Barnes and Morris were favoured as Australia's first-choice opening pair, while Brown batted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle order in the first two Tests.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Bill Brown, their reserve opener, who had batted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in {{the middle}} order and scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings. Brown {{was replaced by the}} all rounder Sam Loxton; the move had an unexpected impact on Johnson's playing role during the Test.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace, accumulating his runs at a lower strike rate than the other recognised batsmen. He was out with the score at 6/402 as Australia went on to declare at 8/462 and win by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was usually against Worcestershire. Bradman and his co-selectors felt that Loxton was not among the 11 strongest players, so he was not selected against Worcestershire. Loxton’s debut had come about because first-choice opener Arthur Morris had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour. Sid Barnes had opened in that match with Bill Brown. Morris and Barnes were Bradman's preferred pair and they opened against Worcestershire, while Brown, who was on his third tour of England, was played <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle-order, pushing Loxton out of the team. Loxton looked on as Brown made 25 and Australia won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Besides Lindsay, {{six players}} have scored {{more than three}} tries in a Championship match; of these Ian Smith is the only player to achieve the feat twice. He scored four tries in {{successive}} matches during the 1925 Five Nations Championship. Wales' Jehoida Hodges normally played as a forward, but after an injury to winger Tom Pearson during a match against England, Hodges {{was moved to the}} wing. Despite playing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position,</b> he scored a hat-trick in a 21–5 victory for Wales. As of 2017, the only forwards to score a Championship hat-trick while actually playing in the forwards are Michel Crauste; he scored three tries for France in their 13–0 victory over England in 1962 and CJ Stander; he scored three tries for Ireland in a 63–10 win over Italy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa for Japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force suddenly appeared to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E

5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that was as close as they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant they were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew {{the majority of the}} Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} matches, which were usually played {{consecutively}} {{with only one}} or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio of openers, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in the middle order {{in the first two}} Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.|$|E

5|$|In the Tests, Woodfull unselfishly {{broke up}} his opening {{combination}} with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 {{to accommodate the}} prodigiously talented young batsman Archie Jackson. Woodfull was uncomfortable batting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position,</b> scoring six, 58 and 17 {{in the first three}} Tests. Woodfull batted only once in each Test, as Australia easily won the first Test by ten wickets, and the next two by an innings. Woodfull was restored {{to the top of the}} order for the fourth Test in Melbourne after Jackson's illness became too much, forcing the young batsman to withdraw from competition. Woodfull struck 83 run out as Australia took a third consecutive innings victory. He then scored his first century for the season, making 177 and 27 not out in a state match against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Kaim had six battalions of infantry, four squadrons of cavalry {{and plenty}} of {{artillery}} deployed at Rothenzholl. He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb {{to the north and}} an advance guard in Loffenau. Saint-Cyr left Duhesme's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain. He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve. Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank, he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad. Taponier surprised the Saxons and sent them scurrying back north. With Lambert and Lecourbe's brigades, Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim. Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses, Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim's troops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
