25|$|On Tatooine, {{there is}} a droid factory that the Galactic Empire has set up, So the {{rebellion}} sends C-3PO and R2-D2 and you, a rebel agent disguised as a Jawa to complete missions leading to the secret droid factory and to reprogram the evil droid army, but first, you must win the trust <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>fellow</b> Jawas. To proceed to the droid factory, the player must complete eight training missions and four top-secret missions with task-specific requirements, Such as 'Droid must be magnetic, Droid {{must be able to}} see in the dark, or Droid must weigh less than 100 kilograms. This allows you to complete the mission. Through experiential learning, players learn about and apply the scientific principles of energy, force, light, engineering, and magnetism. In addition, the game encourages players to apply math, logic, and critical thinking skills. The game contains 87 droid parts which can be combined in 25 million different combinations for manufacturing. In the Jawa Droid Workshop, players can paint and name their creations, and make them dance, while a holographic design grid lets players have a 360 degree view of their work in progress. In in-game InDex provided players with encyclopedic explanations on the science used in the game to help players; it could also link to the internet for access to further links.|$|E

"SIR:– Among {{the members}} of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express to you in some formal way their {{appreciation}} of the great zeal, ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session. As chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the Judiciary Committee of the House, the duties incumbent upon you have been exceeding [...] important and exacting, both in committee room and {{on the floor of the}} House. In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous, industrious, painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>fellow</b> members but of the people of the state at large.

2500|$|Clark {{believes}} that he was punished not for his undisclosed arrest record, but for causing conflict with producers behind the scenes. According to Clark, after {{he made it to}} the twelve finalists' round, he and the other finalists were unduly pressured by producers to sign a contract, using one of two attorneys handpicked by the producers for representation, or be disqualified from the show. Clark and his fellow contestants' position was that having the producers select an attorney for them was a conflict of interest, a conclusion they reached with the advice of Abdul, who had told Clark, [...] "Look, if you can get six <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>fellow</b> contestants to stand up with you and say, 'We want our own attorney, we're not rolling with this stuff you want us to do,' they will not kick off the rest of the cast." [...] The other contestants decided to support him in standing up to producers, and consulted with Paula Abdul's lawyer, Howard Siegel, on Abdul's recommendation (though Clark maintains in his book {{that they did not know}} at the time that Siegel was one of Abdul's attorneys). Two weeks later, producers began asking Clark about his arrest record, and dismissed him from the show.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{arrived at}} on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian {{commander}} Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc {{to turn over}} the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: [...] "Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for you, since it has been only too well earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>fellow</b> citizens". When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: [...] "General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic". Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited St. Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: [...] "At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled…This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country". In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French: [...] "Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweet must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve". Dessalines never received the letter as he already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed Léogane. The Haitians burned down Leogane and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines's actions at Leogane: [...] "Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns". The French, who been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites were stunned to learn how much the Haitians hated them for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of Leogane wrote: [...] "They heaped up bodies" [...] which [...] "still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces".|$|E
