25|$|After {{playing a}} show in Norfolk, Virginia, on March 21, 1956, the Perkins Brothers Band headed to New York City for a March 24 {{appearance}} on NBC-TV's Perry Como Show. Shortly before sunrise on March 22, on Route 13 between Dover and Woodside, Delaware, Stuart Pinkham (also known as Richard Stuart and Poor Richard) assumed duties as driver. After hitting {{the back of a}} pickup truck, their car went into a ditch containing about a foot of water, and Perkins was left lying face down in the water. Drummer Holland rolled Perkins over, saving him from drowning. He had sustained three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a severe concussion, a broken collar bone, and lacerations all over his body in the crash. Perkins remained unconscious for an entire day. The driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> truck, Thomas Phillips, a 40-year-old farmer, died when he was thrown into the steering wheel. Jay Perkins had a fractured neck and severe internal injuries; he never fully recovered and died in 1958.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, 2008, a California Highway Patrol ("CHP") {{dispatcher}} in Humboldt County, California {{received a}} 911 call from an anonymous caller. According to the dispatcher, the caller reported a silver Ford F150 pickup with {{the license plate}} number [...] "8D94925" [...] ran them off the highway. The caller stated that the truck was last seen heading southbound on California State Route 1. CHP dispatchers relayed the report to officers in the geographic area, and the vehicle was soon spotted traveling southbound at mile marker 66 near Fort Bragg, California. Officers pulled over the vehicle and discovered that Lorenzo Prado Navarette and Jose Prado Navarette were the only occupants. After {{standing next to the}} cab <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> truck, the officers noticed [...] "a very distinct smell of marijuana coming from the vehicle". Officers then searched the vehicle and found four large bags containing [...] of marijuana, an unopened box of oven bags, clippers, and fertilizer in the bed of the truck.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that indicia of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that reasonable cause for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> truck, Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows the other car was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 emergency system are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E

50|$|Another popular {{modification}} is {{to reverse}} <b>the</b> electric polarity <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> (or one coil of a dual-coil pickup). When two pickups are selected, this produces {{a very thin}} and weak sound, due to phase cancellation between <b>the</b> <b>pickups.</b> <b>The</b> closer <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> are to each other, the greater the cancellation and thus the weaker and thinner the resulting sound. In case of a humbucker {{this results in a}} sound that is so weak as to be almost unusable, as well as <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickup's</b> hum-cancelling properties (due to the coils being magnetically out-of-phase, but electrically in-phase with each other).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{realization}} of high bandwidth pickup electrodes with a cutoff frequency above 40  GHz. <b>The</b> proposed cone-shaped <b>pickups</b> {{are part of a}} bunch arrival-time monitor designed for high (> 500 [*][*]pC) and low (20  pC) bunch charge operation mode providing for a time resolution of less than 10  fs for both operation modes. The proposed design has a fast voltage response, low ringing, and a resonance-free spectrum. For assessing <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> manufacturing tolerances on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups,</b> an extensive tolerance study has been performed via numerical simulations. A nonhermetic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> was built for measurement and validation purposes. The measurement and simulation results are in good agreement and demonstrate <b>the</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>pickup</b> system to meet the given specifications...|$|R

2500|$|Van Halen (a {{self-described}} [...] "tone chaser") achieved his distinctive tone {{using the}} EVH [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] guitar, a stock 100-watt Marshall amp, a Variac (to lower the voltage of the amp {{to keep the}} same tone as an amplifier running full-blast at lower volumes), and effects such as an Echoplex, an MXR Phase 90, an MXR Flanger, chorus, and EQs as well as wah since the early 90s. Van Halen constructed his now legendary Frankenstrat guitar using a Boogie Bodies factory [...] "2nd" [...] body, Charvel neck, a single vintage Gibson PAF humbucker pickup sealed in molten surfboard wax done {{at home in a}} coffee can to reduce microphonic feedback (which also warped the bobbin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickup),</b> a pre-CBS Fender tremolo bridge (later to be a Floyd Rose bridge) and a single volume control with a knob labeled [...] "tone".|$|E

50|$|Blend potentiometers (essentially two potentiometers ganged on {{the same}} shaft) allow {{blending}} together two pickups in varying degrees.

To improve the measurement accuracy, <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beam position monitor pickups was mapped in the laboratory before they were installed in the BEPC ring. The microcomputer-controlled test set consists of high frequency coaxial switches to select each pickup electrode, a movable antenna to simulate the beam, a signal source, a spectrum analyzer to measure <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> signals, and analysis software. The signal source operates well below the- 3 dB cutoff frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> (buttons).

These guitars, however, could be electrically amplified via a Charlie Christian pickup, a magnetic single-coil <b>pickup</b> that converted <b>the</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibrating strings into an electrical signal. <b>The</b> clear sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> made <b>the</b> ES series immediately popular with jazz musicians.

40|$|A part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beam {{losses at}} {{transition}} crossing of high intensity beams in the CERN PS {{have been attributed}} to an excursion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closed orbit.

Investigations showed that <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> used for <b>the</b> radial loop system was not optimized with respect to the dispersion change caused by <b>the</b> fast change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transition energy. Thanks to new electronics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit measurement system, turn-by-turn orbit data could be recorded around transition crossing. Their analysis, together with calculations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transverse optics, allowed determining a new choice <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> positions for <b>the</b> radial loop.
