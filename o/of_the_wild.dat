5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as playful synonyms of the name.

Ellacombe suggests this may be from Saffon Lilly, citing Prior in support, though admittedly conjectural.|$|E

5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} {{has been}} even more complex and many schemes of subgenera, sections, subsections and series have been proposed, although all had certain similarities. Most authorities now consider there to be 10 – 11 sections based on phylogenetic evidence. The problems have largely arisen from the diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> species, frequent natural hybridisation and extensive cultivation with escape and subsequent naturalisation. The number of species has varied anywhere from 16 to nearly 160, but is probably around 50 – 60.|$|E

In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro.

The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
