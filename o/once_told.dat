5|$|Salinger was romantically {{involved}} with television actress Elaine Joyce {{for several years}} in the 1980s. The relationship ended when he met Colleen O'Neill (b.

5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother <b>once</b> <b>told</b> me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{is later}} kidnapped by Colin, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine <b>once</b> <b>told</b> him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it.|$|E

25|$|James Boswell who was {{a student}} of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that {{speaking}} about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his conversation was unimpressive.

25|$|Some {{say that}} the {{reconstruction}} would have been both much more efficient and inexpensive if more contracts were granted to local Iraqi firms, {{many of whom were}} shut out of the process {{due to the fact that}} they were state-owned.

25|$|Wood {{is remembered}} {{throughout}} the coaching realms as always being {{a student of}} football. Former Dallas Cowboys' head coach, Bill Parcells, <b>once</b> <b>told</b> {{the story of how}} Wood drove five hours each day for weeks just to watch his Texas Tech linebackers practice. Baylor's former head coach, Grant Teaff, said that Wood once spent the night in his film room just to ask how a particular play had been run.

25|$|This legend was {{developed}} {{over time and}} has been chronicled by Gayle Dean Wardlow, Edward Komara and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans {{more than two decades}} after his death. Son House <b>once</b> <b>told</b> the story to Pete Welding as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in Down Beat in 1966. Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.|$|E
25|$|Leontius was {{in prison}} when a monk <b>once</b> <b>told</b> {{him that he would}} one day wear the Imperial diadem. Such talk was not only {{dangerous}} for the monk (who if discovered would have been blinded and exiled for treason) but also dangerous for the man whose ears received— and preyed upon Leontius' mind until in 695 (after being released) he immediately began a relatively unplanned coup. Fortunately for him many of his comrades had also been imprisoned (suggesting that perhaps his entire unit may well have been disgraced) so when he marched upon his former prison to release the inmates, many declared their support for him.|$|E

25|$|Xun Xu {{served as}} the Supervisor of the Palace Writers {{for a long time}} and had access to state secrets.

When someone congratulated on his new appointment, he expressed his anger over losing his previous appointment. When he was serving as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he evaluated his subordinates based on their performance and dismissed those who failed to live up to his expectations. Emperor Wu <b>once</b> <b>told</b> Xun Xu that he hoped that Xun Xu would learn from Xun Yu and Xun You by promoting deserving officials and dismissing corrupt officials. A few months after Xun Xu assumed his new appointment, his mother died so he resigned and wanted to go home for filial mourning. However, Emperor Wu denied him permission and sent Zhou Hui (周恢) to announce an imperial edict ordering him to return to his job.|$|E
