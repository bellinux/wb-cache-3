Pretreatment is a necessary step for efficient and effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel. This study investigated the effects of microwave-assisted alkali pretreatment, microwave pretreatment (distilled water) and untreated canola straw and <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> on the pellet quality, and the conversion of microwave pretreated and alkali treated substrates into sugar for cellulosic bioethanol production. Microwave pretreatments were carried out by immersing the biomass in dilute alkali solutions (NaOH and KOH) at various concentrations of 0, 0. 75 and 1. 5 % (w/v) for microwave-assisted times of 6, 12, and 18 min, and at a fixed microwave power of 713 W. Alkali treatments were carried out by soaking and the same alkali used for the microwave pretreatment. The biomass and alkali concentrations remained unchanged. Chemical composition analysis of canola straw and <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> showed that the application of microwave-assisted alkali pretreatment on the biomass disrupted and broke down the lignocellulosic structure of canola straw and <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> compared to microwave pretreatment and alkali treatment. Images acquired using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed the structural changes caused by microwave-assisted alkali pretreatment on biomass samples.

40|$|<b>Oat</b> <b>hull</b> is an abundantly {{available}} form {{of biomass}} in Canada, which is mostly used as low-value feed material. With high fibre content, {{it can be}} used in the production of industrial products by providing opportunity as an additive in the replacement of petroleum-based products. Moreover, bio-based plastics/ biodegradable polymers are gaining popularity, as reinforced matrices into natural fibres to produce biodegradable composites. Therefore, the objectives of this investigation were to develop biocomposite materials from cellulose and lignin which were post-hydrolysis products of <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> using biodegradable polymers (polylactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL)) and to compare the physical and mechanical properties of formulated biocomposites with polypropylene (PP) biocomposites so that a low-cost and eco-friendly biomaterial can be produced. Further, the effect of an impact modifier was investigated to improve the impact properties of such biocomposites. The <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> biomass was cleaned and chemically pretreated to produce different kinds of fibres by dilute acid hydrolysis followed by delignification at different temperature conditions. The fibres resulting from pretreatment processes were AHB (acid-catalyzed hydrolysis by-product), CRB- 30 and CRB- 65 (cellulose-rich biofibre). Chemical analysis of fibres showed a reduction in hemi-cellulose and lignin content, with increased cellulose content. Formulations with rates of at 15 % and 30 % AHB or CRB fibres of the total mass of biocomposites were tested. The effect of impact modifier at 15 % inclusion rate was also investigated with polylactic acid- and polycaprolactone-based composites. A twin screw extruder and a compression molding machine were respectively used for compounding the formulations and product molding/fabrication. The performance of the composites in all formulations was finally assessed by measuring their physical and mechanical properties such as density, color measurement, water absorption, tensile strength, flexural strength and tensile-impact energy. Fibre loading from 15 % to 30 % significantly affected the density and water absorption of the manufactured composites. The density of composites increased with addition of fibres; water absorption also increased with fibre addition in all formulations. Color analysis showed that products appeared darker in color because of addition of fibres. The results for the mechanical properties of PLA-based composites indicated that tensile and flexural strength of biocomposites generally decreased when compared to those of virgin polymers, while Young’s modulus and flexural modulus increased with corresponding increase in fibre content from 15 % to 30 %. On the other hand, PCL-based biocomposites with 30 % fibre loading offered higher flexural strength than that of composites loaded with 15 % fibres; similarly, tensile modulus and flexural modulus increased with an increase in fibre content. The most significant result is that tensile-impact strength of PLA- and PCL-based composites increased with addition of an impact modifier. Therefore, eco-friendly composites were successfully developed from an <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> biomass by-product in combination with biodegradable polymers...|$|R

40|$|T T IS {{a widely}} known fact that fibrous •* • {{material}} {{is generally not}} well assimi-lated by a growing chick; furthermore, {{the effect on the}} growth of a chick sometimes may be quite derogatory depending on the quantity of the fibrous material used in the diet. This effect is generally considered to be attributable to a reduction in the en-ergy intake (Fraps, 1946; Peterson, 1950). In spite of the above findings, Davis and Briggs (1947) found that chick growth was promoted to a greater extent by a diet con-taining cellulose than one not containing cellulose, and they concluded this phenom-enon might be caused by a specific effect of the cellulose itself or by some cellulose de-composition products. Heuser et al. (1945) and Bird and Whitson (1946) reported that fibrous feed did not affect the rate of egg production. Further, Lillie et al. (1951) found that <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> cellulose contained in a diet even at a level of as high as 64 % did not reduce the rate of egg production, but did actually decrease feed utilization.

The oat hull additions were: 1) 0 % hulls, 2) 8 % hulls, 3) 16 % hulls and 4) 24 % hulls. The last treatment represented the hull content of regular oats. Both, hulled oats and <b>oat</b> <b>hulls,</b> were first ground separately to a fine meal and then pressed into pellets, in order to prevent feed selection by horses. Treatments were assigned in a duplicated 4 x 4 Williams square design. A preliminary feeding of 16 days was followed by 5 day collection in each period.

UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed that the extracted material displays a broadband, structureless absorption profile a common feature of melanins. MALDI-TOF MS measurements demonstrated that oat melanin is a homopolymer built up from p-coumaric acid and consists mainly of low molecular weight (527 - 1499 Da) oligomers of 3 - 9 monomer units. The tetramer oligomer proved to be dominant. The results of the FT-IR analysis indicated that oat melanin is a fully conjugated aromatic system containing tetrasubstituted aromatic rings linked by C-C coupling. The in vitro preparation of melanin from p-coumaric acid by horseradish peroxidase was performed for comparison.

To achieve this goal, the fibers are needed to be ground and be thoroughly analyzed for fiber sizes distributions and aspect ratios distributions to identify {{the size and shape of}} fibers to correlate such information with mechanical properties of the NFPC. In this dissertation, it was found that <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> fibers were smaller than bagasse fibers on average and had lower aspect ratios compared to bagasse fibers. Using Minitab software, two-level factorial experimental design was employed in three design of experiments (DOEs) to check the effect of fiber type, fiber content, coupling agent content, impact modifier type and impact modifier content on mechanical and impact properties of NFPC. Samples as per DOE runs were conditioned, compounded with twin screw co-rotating extruder, injection molded and tested. The results indicated that bagasse interacts much better compared to <b>oat</b> <b>hull</b> with coupling agent. As well, styrene copolymerized with ethylene/propylene rubber appeared to be more effective in increasing impact properties. Coupling agent appeared to very effective increasing tensile properties although had mild deteriorating effect on impact properties. It was found that compared to unfilled polypropylene, bagasse as a natural filler was very effective on Flexural properties, however, bagasse decreased the tensile properties when compared to unfilled polypropylene. SEM microscopy was used to observe mechanism of impact and appeared to support numerical tests results of Izod Impact Energy responses. Statistical methods generally validated the results and best normal residual plot fit was for Izod Impact results which was almost linear. The worst fit however, belonged to mean failure Energy results. Statistical validity of results was also considered in detail using normal residual plots and were reported in detail for each DOE. Generally, the results were validated with some exceptions. It is important to evaluate and understand the effect of UV weathering on properties of commercially available NFPC products. To achieve this goal, a Design of experiment was designed to run tests for effect of weathering and physical impact location on multi-axial impact properties of an NFPC product. Commercial products were cut to size and impacted by multi-axial impact tester and work versus displacement graphs were generated. Effect of UV weathering and impact location was studied on Multi-Axial impact responses of NFPC commercial roofing product and results indicated UV weathering deteriorated total energy, energy to maximum load and maximum load of roofing product. The location of impact either in middle or side or with/without back reinforcement, was not found to be effective on multi-axial impact properties The statistical method used was mildly validated using normal residual plots...|$|R
40|$|In both <b>hulled</b> {{and naked}} <b>oat</b> (Avena sativa L.), {{aberrant}} "fatuoid" plants can occur; {{these can be}} recognized by their prominent twisted and geniculate lemma awns. Fatuoids of <b>hulled</b> <b>oat</b> cannot be used as cultivars because their grain shatters from the plant. In contrast, fatuoids of naked oat do not shatter {{and can be used}} as cultivars. In naked <b>oat,</b> occasional <b>hulled</b> grains may occur, detracting from grain quality and consistency. Some fatuoid lines of naked oat have been observed to produce few hulled grains. Here, we used crosses involving two fatuoid naked oat lines and three nonfatuoid <b>oat</b> cultivars (one <b>hulled</b> and two naked) to study the inheritance of the naked-grained and fatuoid characters. Phenotypic ratios observed in the F 2 generation were not consistent with codominant single-gene models for either character. Dominant single-gene models in which the hulled and fatuoid alleles are recessive, and for which the expression of the dominant gene is variable, were satisfactory in some, but not all, crosses. Within F 2 populations, true-breeding fatuoids could be quite reliably {{selected on the basis of}} the presence of two or more geniculate lemma awns per spikelet, while true-breeding nonfatuoids could be quite reliably selected on the basis of the absence of geniculate lemma awns. In naked oat, fatuoid plants tended to produce fewer hulled grains than nonfatuoid plants, suggesting that the fatuoid condition may enhance the expression of the naked-grained character. Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the genetic control of the naked-grained and fatuoid characters, it should be possible and useful to develop fatuoid naked oat lines for use as cultivars...|$|R
