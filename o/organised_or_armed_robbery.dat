5000|$|Shoplifting (also {{known in}} slang as {{boosting}} and [...] ) {{is a popular}} term used for the unnoticed theft of goods from an open retail establishment. Shoplifting typically involves a person concealing a store item on their person, in pockets or under clothes (or in a bag, baby stroller, etc.) and leaving the store without paying for it. With clothing, shoplifters may put on items from the store and leave the store wearing the clothes. The terms [...] "shoplifting" [...] and [...] "shoplifter" [...] are not usually defined in law. The crime of shoplifting generally falls under the legal classification of larceny.

[...] The {{committee}} consisted of K.S. Anderson, a stipendiary magistrate, and Susan Armstrong, a lecturer of law at UNSW. The committee's review urged that everyone {{had the right to}} be released on bail unless there were strong reasons for refusing it, and recommended that police and the courts should have to show reason why someone should not be granted bail. A study found that bail was more likely to be refused to older people, Aboriginals, [...] "shabby"-looking people (including those wearing beards - possibly a middle-class prejudice), defendants without a lawyer, defendants with a previous criminal record, and defendants who did not ask for bail. Two studies were conducted into bail by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research to assist the Committee, their findings were published in 1977. The BoCSaR review noted that cases such as Philip Western, who killed a bank manager while on bail, were capable of triggering reviews of the bail law. [...] While the Committee recommended a presumption in favour of bail for all offenses, an exception was added for violent <b>or</b> <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> by the NSW Government.

5000|$|Before {{withdrawing}} from the town, the retreating Austrian forces let the criminals out of the prisons, some of whom volunteered to join Polish militia and fight against the Ukrainians. The town was also full of Austrian army deserters. Polish authorities also armed a number of volunteers (including some former criminals) who promised to fight the Ukrainians. In {{the first days of}} the Polish-Ukrainian conflict, the Polish quarter of Lwów was defended only by a group of poorly armed volunteers, mainly students and even younger people in their early teens, known in Polish historiography as Lwów Eaglets. A sizable group of Polish defenders, however, consisted of petty criminals. On November 9-10, the Jews of Lwów formed a militia and declared their neutrality in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict over the city. Other than reports of isolated instances of Jewish support for the Ukrainian side, Lwów's Jews remained officially neutral; the accounts of sporadic Jewish support for the Ukrainians would serve as a rationale for accusations that most Jews adopted the anti-Polish stance. The criminal elements within the Polish forces sometimes engaged in theft <b>or</b> <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> while wearing Polish insignia; when these criminals were fired on by the Jewish self-defence militia, some Poles believed that the Jews were fighting against Poland. The West Ukrainian People's Republic respected Jewish neutrality and during the two weeks that the city was controlled by Ukrainian forces there were no incidents of anti-Jewish violence. Poles resented the proclaimed Jewish neutrality, and there were reports, leading to exaggerated rumors, that some Jews, including the militia, collaborated with the Ukrainians in various ways, up to actively engaging the Polish forces. On the morning November 22, after taking the city in the night of November 21 to November 22, and amidst rumors that Lwów's Jews would be made to pay for their [...] "neutrality" [...] in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict, Polish forces interned and disarmed the Jewish militia.|$|R

40|$|<b>Armed</b> <b>robbery</b> is {{a serious}} crime that can have a {{negative}} impact on individual victims and employees of targeted businesses. People who work in locations vulnerable to <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> can experience emotional repercussions if present at work during an <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) continues to undertake research to assist in reducing <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> in Australia and to reduce the severity of the effect this crime can have on people’s lives. The National <b>Armed</b> <b>Robbery</b> Monitoring Program (NARMP) was established in 2003 to fill an information gap on trends and patterns of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> in Australia, with a particular focus on identifying changes over time in the use of specific weapons. The 2007 annual report is the fifth publication since the (AIC) began monitoring this offence. Building on previous analyses, this 2007 report provides an overview of the 7, 133 victims of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> and the situations, including locations, which made them vulnerable to victimisation. The 2007 data collection and annual report has included additional information about <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> incidents. In total, there were 6, 086 <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> incidents in 2007. The inclusion of this additional data allows for a more detailed examination of <b>armed</b> <b>robberies</b> reported to police in Australian state and territories during 2007. Such information is valuable in assisting law enforcement as it provides a more complete picture of incidents of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> This includes being able to determine whether there are any differences in net gains for offenders based on the type of weapon they use, the locations they target, or whether the offence is committed by one or more offenders. Equally important is being able to assess whether crime prevention initiatives are having their desired impact. Separate AIC publications have been produced in recent times for this purpose, focusing on specific locations vulnerable to <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> such as service stations. To build further on this crime prevention focus, a section on crime prevention for <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> is included in the report. Many of the AIC’s long term monitoring programs, including the NARMP, are dependent upon the support and cooperation of state and territory police. The NARMP is now accumulating enough data that some basic trends can be explored for recent years and analysis is able to provide further insight into some very different <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> scenarios, including high-yield <b>armed</b> <b>robberies.</b> A case study is presented in this year’s annual report examining some of the most serious incidents of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery,</b> including those carried out by ‘professional’ offenders...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, four <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> {{profiles}} {{have been}} constructed, {{based on information}} contained in qualitative police narratives supplied {{as part of the}} AIC’s National <b>Armed</b> <b>Robbery</b> Monitoring Program. Summary In 2010, approximately 5, 000 individuals and organisations reported being the victim of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> After assault and sexual assault, <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> is the third most common violent crime reported; a trend that has remained consistent over the last 10 years (AIC 2013). However, <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> is unique when compared with other types of violence due to its overlap with property crime. Specifically, while <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> involves the use or threat of force or violence, the primary purpose is to deprive the individual or organisation of their property (Pink 2011). A such, an incident of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> can have both immediate and long-term psychological and economic ramifications for the victim. Therefore, the prevention of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> remains a key focus of business groups,as well as law enforcement agencies. In order to develop effective crime prevention strategies, it is necessary to acknowledge the heterogeneous nature of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> Incidents of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> can vary depending on whether the victim was a person or an organisation, whether the offender was armed with a knife, firearm or other weapon, or whether the offence occurred on the street or in a commercial premise (Borzycki & Fuller 2014; Mouzos & Borzycki 2003). Therefore, understanding the qualitative differences between incidents is vital in order to avoid implementing ineffective and generic approaches to <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> prevention. Previous profiles of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> have almost exclusively focused on the of fender. Research conducted in Australia and overseas has examined the characteristics and motivations of offenders in order to explain the variations in robbery (see Gabor et al. 1987; Matthews 2002; Mouzos & Borzycki 2003; Nugent et al. 1989; Walsh 1986). However, while such an approach has merits as an investigative tool, it is limited in its presentation of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> more generally. Specifically, these profiles fail to appropriately capture the influence of the environment and the victim on the offender. It would therefore be useful, when looking to prospectively prevent crime, to broaden this focus and incorporate not just the offender but also vulnerabilities associated with particular victims and/or locations...|$|R
40|$|D. Cur. <b>Armed</b> <b>robbery</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common crimes in South-Africa and often leads to signs of mental problems. The focus of heal {{services}} in South Africa is on primary healthcare. Therefore it would be more effective to treat the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> at the primary level, that is before symptoms of the traumatic reaction convert into mental illness. Therapists observed, however, that survivors of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> terminate therapy prematurely. This might be the reason for failing to use all opportunities to recover within a reasonable period of time. When the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> does not complete therapy, or does not receive therapy, it leads to a serious decrease in the survivor's mental health status and can necessitate admission and, or treatment with medication. To prevent admission and treatment with medicines, the researcher explored the experience of therapy in order to use the information as a departure point for a model for facilitative interaction for the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> by the psychiatric nurse. The aim of this research is the description of a model for facilitative interaction for the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> that can be used by the psychiatric nurse at primary health care level. The researcher followed certain steps to reach the goal. Firstly the experience of the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> and the experience of the therapist of the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> following this traumatic incident was explored and described. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with the two target groups, it is the survivors of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> and the therapists of survivors of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by the researcher and another objective coder. Thereafter a litterature review was done to support the research results which was integrated into the results. Thirdly, concepts were identified, defined and classified in order to create a model for the psychiatric nurse's facilitative interaction with the survivor of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery.</b> Fourthly the structure and process of the model were described and explained by means of illustrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of service station <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> has steadily {{increased over the}} past decade. This paper examines the {{incidence of}} <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> at service stations and profiles the offenders involved. The incidence of service station <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> has steadily increased over the past decade. Using the Australian Institute of Criminology 2 ̆ 7 s National <b>Armed</b> <b>Robbery</b> Monitoring Program (NARMP) data, this paper examines the incidence of <b>armed</b> <b>robbery</b> at service stations and profiles the offenders involved. The NARMP data shows that about one in ten <b>armed</b> <b>robberies</b> in Australia were of service stations, and that these {{were more likely to}} be targeted at night by lone offenders using knives. The most common item stolen was cash, with an average value of 643. The relative youth of the offenders — on average 23 years old — and infrequent use of firearms suggests the <b>armed</b> <b>robberies</b> involved little if any planning. This opportunistic targeting of service stations has been attributed to their extended opening hours, their sale of cigarettes and other exchangeable goods, their high volume of cash transactions and their isolation from other businesses. Widespread adoption of crime prevention measures by service stations, such as transfer trays, could help reduce their risk of being robbed, but the paper cautions that displacement effects should be considered prior to the implementation of new countermeasures.  ...|$|R
