5|$|Critic Andy Gill {{links the}} <b>opening</b> <b>line</b> {{of the song}} to the title of Arthur Koestler's bleak novel Darkness at Noon, set in the Great Stalinist purge of 1938 in Soviet Russia. For Gill, Dylan is {{suggesting}} that the human spirit can be cast into darkness by the dead hand of communism {{as well as by}} American capitalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003, costing NOK590 million. With the <b>opening,</b> <b>line</b> 4 was {{extended}} from Ullevål stadion to Storo. Nydalen {{had grown up}} as an urban redevelopment area after the local industry had been abandoned in the 1980s, where 14,800 jobs had been located by 2004. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass, with the whole project costing NOK1,348 million.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the two high-powered offenses, {{both of which were}} led by strong rushing attacks. The rushing attacks differed; Northern Illinois' was led by junior quarterback Jordan Lynch, who finished fourth in the nation in rushing, while Kent State's was led by a running back tandem consisting of Dri Archer and Trayion Durham. The <b>opening</b> <b>line</b> favored Northern Illinois by seven points. After being tied at the end of regulation, the game went into two overtime periods and eventually concluded with Northern Illinois winning 44–37. The Huskies were subsequently invited to the 2013 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the <b>opening,</b> <b>line</b> 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
5|$|Despite the obstacles, {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The <b>opening</b> <b>line</b> of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the <b>opening,</b> <b>Line</b> 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion.

25|$|The epic {{begins with}} a {{dedication}} section, with the poet paying homage to Virgil and Homer. The first line mimics the <b>opening</b> <b>line</b> of the Aeneid, and pays a hopeful tribute to the young King Sebastião. The story, then (in imitation of the classical epics) portrays the gods of Greece watching over the voyage of Vasco da Gama. Just as the gods had divided loyalties during the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas, here Venus, who favors the Portuguese, is opposed by Bacchus, who is here associated with the east and resents the encroachment on his territory. We encounter Vasco da Gama's voyage in medias res as they have already rounded the Cape of Good Hope. At the urging of Bacchus, who is disguised as a Moor, the local Muslims plot to attack the explorer and his crew.|$|E

Another shows Burke and semi-naked male gymnasts exercising, whilst another shows Burke donning the lace outfit singing and dancing {{in front of a}} glitter wall, while Laza Morgan does also. The video begins with Burke singing the <b>opening</b> <b>line</b> of the song and performing various dance moves. This scene is intercut by Laza Morgan who begins to perform his lines and introducing himself and Burke. The next scene shows Burke and the male gymnasts exercising/dancing in a gym then beginning a dance routine. Subsequently, in the chorus is Burke and her male dancers performing the main dance routine which is occasionally interrupted to show shots of Burke in the gym and singing in front of the glitter wall.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's <b>opening</b> <b>line,</b> therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
