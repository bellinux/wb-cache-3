5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations <b>of</b> <b>marital</b> infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E

According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance.

5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list of individual rights. It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right <b>of</b> <b>marital</b> privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.|$|E

40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) The {{institution}} of marriage rests upon shared expectations <b>of</b> appropriate <b>marital</b> behaviour including those of sexual fidelity and lifetime partnership. Therefore, a wife whose husband has been convicted of rape, experiences a violation in her marriage. The experience <b>of</b> the <b>marital</b> relationship <b>of</b> convicted rapists is not a well-documented phenomenon, particularly from the offenders’ wives’ perspectives. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was adopted to explore the experience and the meanings that participants attributed to the phenomenon <b>of</b> the <b>marital</b> relationship with a convicted rapist. Descriptions of such experiences were sourced from open-ended interviews conducted with three participants. Participant interviews were transcribed and analysed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Despite the distinctiveness of the participants’ individual experiences, the researcher identified five superordinate themes common across the three participants’ descriptions. These themes are encapsulated as follows: (a) Wives’ positive experiences <b>of</b> their <b>marital</b> relationship; (b) Wives’ negative experiences <b>of</b> their <b>marital</b> relationship; (c) Wives’ ambivalent experiences in their marital relationship; (d) Wives’ emotional experiences {{as a consequence of}} their former husbands’ convictions for rape; and (e) Wives’ experiences of stigmatisation. The findings have potential implications for future research...|$|R
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period <b>of</b> <b>marital</b> intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless <b>of</b> <b>marital</b> status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E

40|$|The grief {{reactions}} of bereaved {{mothers and fathers}} and their perception <b>of</b> their <b>marital</b> relationship {{following the death of}} their infant were examined and compared with nonbereaved couples. The correlation between bereaved parents' grief reactions and their marital intimacy was also explored. A total of 114 couples participated in the study, 57 bereaved couples and 57 nonbereaved. Bereaved couples had lost an infant ($>$ 20 weeks gestation and $<$ 1 year of age) within 24 months of the home visit. Bereaved women rated their grief reactions higher than their spouse. Bereaved women also differed in their perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>marital</b> intimacy compared to their husbands.

40|$|D. Phil. (Educational Psychology) There is {{substantial}} evidence that potential marital partners {{have difficulty with}} their decision-making for a marital partner. As a result these potential marital partners often base their decisions <b>of</b> a <b>marital</b> partner on limited awareness. Little or no {{research has been done}} on the decision-making process <b>of</b> a <b>marital</b> partner, and that is why the question can be asked: "How did you make the choice for a marital partner?" The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a model as framework of reference for the facilitation of awareness in the decision-making process for a marital partner as integral part of mental health. A theory generative, qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was used to conduct this study. The fieldwork was done by having semistructured phenomenological interviews with marital partners. The results obtained were analysed and categorised. The results obtained from the analysed data reflect the fact that potential marital partners make the choice <b>of</b> a <b>marital</b> partner based on limited awareness. The main concept of facilitation of awareness in the decision-making <b>of</b> a <b>marital</b> partner was identified and defined as creating a safe space wherein people can be assisted in becoming conscious about their inner and outer world. A model was developed as framework of reference to facilitate awareness in the decision-making process <b>of</b> a <b>marital</b> partner as integral part of mental health...|$|R

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} assumptions <b>of</b> behavioural <b>marital</b> therapy (BMT) are that maritally distressed couples (DCs) emit lower frequencies of pleasing behaviours, higher frequencies of aversive behaviours, and desire more behaviour change by their spouses than do nondistressed couples (NDC).

Couples also completed the Areas of Change Questionnaire (ACQ) which measures the desired behaviour change by spouse, and perceptions of change requested of self by spouse.
