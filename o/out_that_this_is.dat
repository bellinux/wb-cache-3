5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E

25|$|Based on this, {{one might}} think that, if the wavefunction for each {{particle}} (in more precise terms, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy {{the laws of physics}} (apart from the weak interaction). It turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (P=−1, or alternatively P=–), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (P=+1, or alternatively P=+).|$|E
25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{stressed}} {{the idea of}} an active mind even in otium (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's Vetus Itala in De otio religioso where in Christianity it was associated with contemplation and vacatio (vacate—be still). He points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> associated with videre (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of otium as vacate et videte (be still and see—a form of meditation, contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.|$|E

25|$|Fitzpatrick {{continues}} to develop her {{ideas of the}} importance of community with an analysis of digital text preservation in which she proposes that current technical issues with digital text preservation will require social solutions. This proposal is based on Fitzpatrick’s reasoning that difficulties in the preservation of digital texts are not caused by any quality inherent to digital artifacts but, rather, stem from our understanding of digital products and our social practices concerning their use. It is often assumed that issues with digital preservation are due to the ephemeral quality of digital artifacts. Fitzpatrick points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not entirely correct, illustrating that print text is by no means permanent and digital text is far more permanent than is commonly thought. The loss of access to digital texts or their interpretability, sometimes due to incompatibility between older media formats and newer platforms, is mistakenly perceived as the loss of digital texts themselves. Establishing this fact, Fitzpatrick argues that digital preservation efforts should not focus entirely on technical solutions to technical issues, but instead should concentrate on developing socially organized preservation systems. In addition to focusing on the development of preservation practices through community organization, Fitzpatrick argues that creators of digital artifacts must take steps to ensure the compatibility of their work with preservation efforts, stating: “…planning for the persistent availability of digital resources as {{part of the process of}} their creation will provide the greatest stability of the resources themselves at the least possible cost”.|$|E

[...] However, Berton also points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an over-simplification of national stereotypes. Arguably Expo did, {{for a short period}} anyway, bridge the 'Two Solitudes.' ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea gave the episode a largely positive review wrote that Michael is [...] "totally taken with himself", but still [...] "has shown us his vulnerabilities". Sciannamea noted that, by showing the audience Michael's humanity, the writers were making [...] "this sitcom so compelling". Sciannamea, however, did point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the second week}} in a row that [...] "Pam is offended by something Jim has said or done", which in his mind [...] "will get tiresome quickly if it continues". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "B+".

500|$|In 2011, {{graduate}} student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen. Using {{scanning electron microscopy}} technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then {{compared to that of}} 87modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, new analyses of Archaeopteryxs feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation, insisting the wing feather was [...] "matte black with a darker tip" [...] and one of his colleagues also brought up the subject in a review paper however, no new evidence was published.|$|E
500|$|Many of the plaintiff's experts also {{relied on}} the {{reported}} detection of measles virus RNA in Michelle's intestinal tissue. This claim was based on results from O'Leary's Unigenetics lab, and was examined by Stephen Bustin, a world-renowned expert on polymerase chain reaction who has authored a number of scientific papers on the subject, {{as well as a}} book entitled A-Z of Quantitative PCR. He pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> based on results from the O'Leary lab, and concluded, based on a 2002 paper by Uhlmann that described their PCR methodology, that this lab contained a lot of contaminating DNA, and that the assays were actually detecting this DNA rather than the RNA which makes up the measles virus. Bustin pointed out that, among other things, O'Leary's Unigenetics lab which published this study neglected to use controls, and also did not discuss contamination. For this reason, Bustin concluded that [...] "the positive results from the Unigenetics laboratory are spurious and likely {{to be the result of}} contamination or false positives," [...] citing two other peer-reviewed papers as evidence for this claim. In addition, Bustin and Bertus Rima both testified that Cotter was unable to replicate the Unigenetics lab's results, in contrast to Kennedy's claim that they were able to replicate these results.|$|E
