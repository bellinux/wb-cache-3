The lifting surface method solves the localized propeller problem, while the Euler/IBLT solver handles the global flowfield, capturing the effective inflow problem. For viscous flows, the boundary layer is constructed based upon the parameters specified by the IBLT solution, and is merged with the inviscid Euler flowfield. The robust coupled method is capable of representing <b>open</b> <b>propellers,</b> ducted propulsors, and internal flow cases, including multi-blade row applications. For large axisymmetic bodies, the user may specify a nominal inflow, and the coupled method {{is used for the}} localized propulsor problem only, further increasing the computational efficiency. The specified nominal flow field may be calculated by other numerical flow solvers, obtained from experimental results, or calculated from a Euler/IBLT solution of the entire body.

Ducted propellers are prevalent in modern marine propulsion systems, and the application of this technology continues to expand.

40|$|Ducted fan vertical/short {{take-off}} {{and landing}} (V/STOL) uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAV) are popular {{because of their}} capacity of offering a higher static thrust/power ratio for a given diameter than <b>open</b> <b>propellers.</b> They are also known as camera/antenna carrying or sensor positioning devices. Because of their complicated missions, {{they need to be}} capable of flight in a broad range of atmospheric conditions. In forward flight, the performance of these vehicles is poor because of the distorted inlet flow. The present experimental study uses a planar particle image velocimeter (PIV) system to investigate the near duct aerodynamic performance in hover and forward flight condition. High resolution PIV measurements provide reliable aerodynamic measurements forming a validation basis for further analytical and computational design studies. A radial equilibrium based fan aerodynamic model in combination with angular momentum conservation principle and energy equation is effectively integrated into a three-dimensional RANS based computational system.

40|$|Tilting ducted fans {{present a}} {{solution}} for the lifting and forward flight propulsion requirements of VTOL aircraft. However, the geometry of the duct enshrouding the propeller has great a effect on {{the efficiency of the}} fan in various flight modes. Shroud geometry controls the velocity and pressure at the face of the fan, while maintaining a finite loading out at the tips of the fan blades. A duct tailored for most efficient generation of static lifting thrust will generally suffer from performance deficiencies in forward flight. The converse is true as well, leaving the designer with a difficult trade affecting the overall performance and sizing of the aircraft. Ideally, the shroud of a vertical lifting fan features a generous bell mouth inlet promoting acceleration of flow into the face of the fan, and terminating in a converging nozzle at the exit. Flow entering the inlet is accelerated into the fan by the circulation about the shroud, resulting in an overall increase in thrust compared to an <b>open</b> <b>propeller</b> operating under the same conditions. The accelerating shroud design is often employed in lifting ducted fans to benefit from the thrust augmentation; however, such shroud designs produce significant drag penalties in axial flight, thus are unsuitable for efficient forward flight applications. Decelerating, or diffusing, duct designs are employed for higher speed forward flight configurations. The lower circulation on the shroud tends to decelerate the flow into the face of the fan, which is detrimental to static thrust development; however, net thrust is developed on the shroud while the benefits of finite blade loading are retained. With judicious shroud design for intended flight speeds, a net increase in efficiency can be obtained over an <b>open</b> <b>propeller.</b> In this experiment, conducted under contract to NASA LaRC (contract NAG- 1 - 02093) circulation control is being applied to a mildly diffusing shroud design, intended for improved forward flight performance, to generate circulation in the sense of an accelerating duct design. The intent is to improve static thrust performance of a ducted fan tailored for high speed axial flight, {{while at the same time}} significantly reduce the pressure signature on the ground plane. Circulation control on the fan shroud is achieved by the Coanda effect...|$|E

40|$|Open water {{tests of}} propellers, pod units and {{thruster}} units are usually {{performed in a}} steady manner where the forward velocity and propeller rotation rate are constant during each measurement. It can require {{a considerable amount of}} time in the towing tank to complete an open water diagram with this method. Therefore, a faster method is proposed which applies a quasi-steady approach; the forward velocity of the towing carriage is varied while the thrust and torque are measured continuously. With this method, the normal open water diagram (J= 0 to KT = 0) can be determined in one single run through the towing tank instead of multiple runs. This quasi-steady open water (QSO) procedure greatly reduces the time required to perform open water model tests. The method has been tested at MARIN. During those tests, it was seen that there are hysteresis effects on the raw data, but those can be negated by taking the average of the accelerating and the decelerating halves of the measurement.
