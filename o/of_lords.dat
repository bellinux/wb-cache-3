5|$|The House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary peers {{to a seat}} in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b> Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b> This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who {{are not part of the}} House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1999 House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Act, a {{new form}} of {{representative}} peer was introduced to allow some hereditary peers to stay in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Jagdish temple {{has very}} old idols (almost 300 years old) <b>of</b> <b>Lord</b> Jagannath (Lord Krishna). The {{specialty}} of this temple {{is that there}} are two idols <b>of</b> The <b>Lord</b> and both are <b>of</b> <b>Lord</b> Jagannath (Krishna). In other temples <b>of</b> <b>Lord</b> Jagannath there are three idols - Lord Krishna, Lord Balram and Devi Subhadra (Sister <b>of</b> <b>Lord</b> Krishna and Lord Balram). But in Jagdish Mandir - Kurseong both the idols are <b>of</b> The <b>Lord.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{statement}} in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E

5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.|$|E

5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b> Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E

5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Bill into the House of Commons. The House of Commons passed the bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b>|$|E

5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b> Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b>|$|E
5|$|The House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Act 1999 (c. 34) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that was}} given Royal Assent on 11 November 1999. The Act {{reformed}} the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> one of the chambers of Parliament. For centuries, the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the Act removed such a right. However, {{as part of a}} compromise, the Act did permit ninety-two hereditary peers to remain in the House on an interim basis. Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House.|$|E
5|$|The last {{trial in}} the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> was that of Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford, in 1935 for {{manslaughter}} (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added {{an amendment to the}} Criminal Justice Act 1948, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> Act 1999 restricted this privilege to members of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords.</b> The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords,</b> taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House <b>of</b> <b>Lords</b> and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E
