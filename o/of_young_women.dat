A type of intrauterine device (IUD) known as the Dalkon shield led to increased rates of PID in the 1970s. Current IUDs are not associated with this problem after the first month.|$|E

According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E

5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho.

Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.|$|E
5|$|Blomkvist's {{daughter}} Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him {{and notes}} that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander {{based on the work}} she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on {{the eastern end of}} Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party that he gave for the Boiler Room Girls, a group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated presidential {{campaign}} the year before. Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge (which did not have a guardrail at that time). Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> in his dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} the doctors and insurers and {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity. After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows that}} gender {{differences}} in fecundity horizons may cause persis-tent under-representation of women in high-powered professions, unless coordination failures in women’s marriage-timing decisions are corrected. To the extent {{that there is a}} trade-off between early marriage and investment in a high-powered career, an age-induced decline in women fertility may cause marriage prospects of high-powered women to depend on the marriage-timing decisions <b>of</b> <b>younger,</b> more fertile <b>women.</b> Under these assumptions, women’s marriage-timing decisions exhibit strategic complementarities. For the initial cohort <b>of</b> <b>younger</b> <b>women,</b> these complemen-tarities induce a non-cooperative game with two Pareto-ranked, Nash-equilibria. Because of the interdependence of women marriage prospects across age-cohorts, the marriage-timing chosen by the initial cohort <b>of</b> <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> determines that <b>of</b> all subsequent cohorts, leading to steady-state equilibria whereby history repeats itself across all future cohorts of women. Either they all are married women with a high-powered career, or they all are married with a low-powered career. As the former is rather counterfactual, our analysis suggests that persistent professional imbal-ances between the sexes are caused by a coordination failure in the marriage-timing decisions of the initial cohort <b>of</b> <b>younger</b> <b>women.</b> (JEL: J 12; J 16; J 24...|$|R
