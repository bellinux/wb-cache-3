5|$|Mask <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Eclipse {{was first}} {{revealed}} in January 2008 at a Tecmo press conference. It {{was the first}} series title to be developed and released for a Nintendo console. It was released on July 31, 2008. Its release was timed to coincide with a traditional time in Japan for people to tell each other ghost stories. Upon release, the game featured several bugs affecting player progress through the game, as revealed in a message to fans from Nintendo. While no North American release was planned, a European release was in the works and was briefly outed by a French gaming magazine. After the leak, Nintendo stated that a European release had been planned, but since then the localization had been cancelled. In addition to Nintendo, no other third-party publisher would publish the game overseas, leaving Mask <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Eclipse as a Japan-exclusive title.|$|E

40|$|Apollo 17 {{carried a}} {{miniature}} mass spectrometer, called <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> Atmospheric Composition Experiment (LACE), {{to the moon}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apollo <b>Lunar</b> Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) to study the composition and variations in <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> instrument was successfully deployed in the Taurus-Littrow Valley with its entrance aperture oriented upward to intercept and measure <b>the</b> downward flux <b>of</b> gases at <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> surface. During <b>the</b> ten lunations that the LACE operated, it produced a large base <b>of</b> data on <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> atmosphere, mainly collected at night time. It was found that thermal escape is the most rapid loss mechanism for hydrogen and helium. For heavier gases, photoionization followed by acceleration through the solar wind electric field accounted for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss. The dominant gases on the moosn were argon and helium, and models formed for their distribution are described in detail. It is concluded that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helium in <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> atmosphere is <b>of</b> solar wind origin, and that there also exist very small amounts of methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide...|$|R

5|$|While many {{versions}} of the tale exist, Ila is usually described as a daughter or son of Vaivasvata Manu and thus the sibling of Ikshvaku, {{the founder of the}} Solar Dynasty. In versions in which Ila is born female, she changes into a male form by divine grace soon after her birth. After mistakenly entering a sacred grove as an adult, Ila is either cursed to change his/her gender every month or cursed to become a woman. As a woman, Ilā married Budha, the god of the planet Mercury and the son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> deity Chandra (Soma), and bore him a son called Pururavas, the father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lunar</b> dynasty. After the birth of Pururavas, Ilā is transformed into a man again and fathered three sons.|$|E

5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lunar</b> orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
