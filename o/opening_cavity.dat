40|$|AbstractAimTo {{present a}} case of mandibular first molar with addictional distolingual root (Radix Entomolaris). IntroductionRadix Entomolaris is an {{additional}} third root {{that can be found}} lingually in first mandibular molars; in European population it has be reported that separate Radix Entomolaris is present with a frequency of 5 %. 1 It is of utmost importance that the clinician be familiar with root and root canal anatomy. It allows mechanical and chemical cleaning of the entire pulp cavity and its complete three-dimensional obturation. One of the main reasons for root canal treatment failure in molars is because the clinicians has not removed all the pulp tissue and microorganisms from the root canal system. 2 The knowledge of endodontic anatomy is also important to prevent procedural errors such as instrument separations, zips and root perforations. Materials and methodsIn this article an orthograde retreatment of mandibular first molar with Radix Entomolaris is described. DiscussionClinicians should be aware of Radix Entomolaris through 1. a thorough inspection of the pre-treatment radiograph 2. a trapezoidal <b>opening</b> <b>cavity</b> 3. a conservative instrumentation because RE often presents a moderate/severe curvature in the coronal third that could be masked on regular periapical radiographs...|$|E
40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} element for many biological life forms {{as part of a}} large number of prosthetic groups of proteins involved in central cellular processes. The cellular iron content should be maintained within a narrow range to avoid the adverse consequences of iron deficiency or excess. The preservation of cellular iron homeostasis is achieved through coordinated regulation of iron absorption, storage and export by protein IRP 1 (Iron Regulatory Protein 1). IRP 1 (PDB 3 SNP) binds IREs (Iron Responsive Elements) in UTRs of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in the iron recruitment, abduction and export. On the other hand, the cytosolic aconitase (PDB 2 B 3 Y), that contains a cluster [4 Fe- 4 S] at active site, and is a key enzyme in the main energy production pathway being part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Aconitase and IRP 1 show significant sequence identity and the main hypothesis is that they are both the same protein despite the significant structural and functional differences. The first objective of this study is to determine whether these two proteins are really the same. By using computational methods, the mechanism by which the apo- 2 B 3 Y can alter its function, going from a closed conformation with the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster to an open conformation without cluster, has been studied in detail. To understand the conformational change, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed. Overall, the results obtained in this work have shown that the enzyme cytosolic aconitase evolves towards an open conformation. Thus, concluding that the same protein performs two functions: in low iron conditions it bind to IREs mRNA acting as IRP 1 and in high iron conditions assembles [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster acting as cytosolic aconitase. The second aim of the project consists of analysing the effect of mutations on the aconitase conformational change. In this work, several residues from the <b>opening</b> <b>cavity</b> are mutated. The most significant effects corresponds to the double mutation S 778 A_R 780 Q which is able to retain the protein in a closed conformation similar to PDB 2 B 3 Y. The residues 778 and 780 play an important role in the transition from cytosolic aconitase to IRP 1, being a critical factor in identifying iron-related diseases and in advancing the clinical treatments for such disorders of iron metabolis...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Recent {{experiments}} with the relativistic klystron amplifier (RKA) {{indicate that the}} frequency and efficiency of current modulation are monochromatic and almost 100 percent in appropriate system parameters 1. One of the main issues in the RKA is enhancement of power at high frequency. The size and <b>opening</b> of <b>cavities</b> in the RKA should be reduced, to increase the excitation frequency. Therefore, a high-power high-frequency klystron amplifier has inherent problems due to reduced cavity size, including electron emission and ac beam loading at the gap <b>opening</b> of <b>cavities.</b> To minimize these problems, we propose to eliminate the intermediate cavities and to modulate beam current {{by means of the}} resistive-wall instability. In the conventional klystron, the beam energy is modulated at the first cavity and this modulation is reinforced in the intermediate cavities before the beam segments arrive in the extraction cavity. 1 In the resistive-wall klystro...|$|R

The periodic velocity {{field in the}} region of the <b>cavity</b> <b>opening</b> has been measured for various flow conditions and the vorticity distribution has been computed from the measured data using numerical differentiation. The results indicate that the shear layer rolls up into discreet vortices, which travel across the <b>cavity</b> <b>opening.</b> Two resonances were found. The first is characterized by a single vortex being present and results in the greatest amplitude. The second is characterized by the presence of two vortices which excite a distinct but lesser amplitude resonance. As the flow velocity changes, the position of these vortices shifts relative to the phase of the acoustic cycle. The timing of the interaction between the moving vortices and the acoustic particle velocity determines, to a large extent, the intensity of the excitation, and therefore also the oscillation amplitude.
