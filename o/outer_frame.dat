5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
25|$|May 9, 1994: A {{carefully}} assembled <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> {{of a car}} painted as an MIT Campus Police car {{appeared on}} top of the Great Dome. This hack quickly gained recognition on many local news sources and on national television.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{positions}} of the 27 stars on the globe make the Brazilian flag {{one of the most}} complicated national flags to construct. The official design is defined by law no. 5,700, issued on 1 September 1971. The flag's length is twenty modules and the width, fourteen, translating into an aspect ratio of 10:7. The distance of the vertices of the yellow rhombus to the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> is a module and seven-tenths (1.7m). The blue circle {{in the middle of the}} yellow rhombus has a radius of three and a half modules (3.5m). The center of the arcs of the white band is two modules (2m) to the left of the meeting point of the extended vertical diameter of the circle with the base of the <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> The radius of the lower arc of the white band is eight modules (8m) and the radius of the upper arc of the white band is eight and a half modules (8.5m). The width of the white band is a half of a module (0.5m).|$|E

40|$|Abstractg-Frames {{are natural}} generalizations of frames which cover many other recent generalizations of frames, e. g., bounded quasi-projectors, <b>frames</b> of subspaces, <b>outer</b> <b>frames,</b> oblique frames, pseudo-frames and {{a class of}} time-frequency {{localization}} operators. Moreover, {{it is known that}} g-frames are equivalent to stable space splittings. In this paper, we study the stability of g-frames. We first present some properties for g-Bessel sequences. Then we prove that g-frames are stable under small perturbations. We also study the stability of dual g-frames...|$|R
25|$|Jaw crushers {{are heavy}} duty {{machines}} and hence {{need to be}} robustly constructed. The <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation {{if they are to}} be taken underground for carrying out the operations.|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> with the motor axles {{parallel with the}} wheel axles. Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the wheel axles via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Airflow can be {{harvested}} by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The Windbeam’s novel design {{allows it to}} operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E
50|$|Empacher, as {{all other}} racing shell manufacturers, have {{replaced}} wooden boats with carbon fibre and honeycomb sandwich constructions. The nomex honeycomb reinforces the kevlar/carbon fibre inner and <b>outer</b> <b>frames.</b> Empacher uses a vacuum bag technique to bond {{the outer layers}} with the honeycomb core. Combining kevlar and epoxy resin creates a tear and impact resistant outer shell. Empacher reinforces the gunwale with an additional carbon layer and carbon foam frames.|$|R
5000|$|While many {{residents}} have now bought these properties and made many alterations, the original floorplan for most houses {{consisted of a}} hallway, front room and then a rear kitchen with pantry, coal hole and a downstairs toilet. As these houses were originally rented, they had identical wooden doors and windows painted cream, with either dark green or brown doors and <b>outer</b> <b>frames.</b> Wooden fences with a garden hedge were also placed around every house.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} used on steam {{locomotives}} with fixed <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> and coupled axles. Typically the conventionally driven wheels are in the centre and there are outer Klien-Lindner axles, front and rear. In this way the wheels, which are fixed to the hollow axles, are 'steered' by shafts that pivot on the frame when the locomotive is curve running. Coupling rods from the conventional driving wheels in the centre act on drive cranks on the inner axles fixed to the frame.|$|R
25|$|The {{first three}} series of Washington-Franklin postage stamps {{depicted}} Washington on every denomination {{except for the}} ONE CENT issue, which presented Benjamin Franklin's profile inside the same frame design {{as that of the}} Washington issues. On January 11, 1912 Franklin for the first time began to appear on denominations of 8-cents and higher. Each of the seven successive series brought various changes in design, color, perforations, paper and sometimes printing methods. In addition to these series, there are a few individual stamps—issued {{near the end of the}} Washington-Franklin era—that can not be categorized within one of the series because of design or perforation anomalies. The last Washington-Franklin was issued in May 1923, a 1-cent green Washington-head with olive leaves, (Scott 544) would coincidentally also become the rarest postage stamp of the issue (errors excepted) and can only be positively identified by measuring its <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> dimensions. Because its distinct features are not readily apparent, this variety sometimes turns up in every day collections. This, however, is unusual, as the stamp was printed in very limited quantities and consequently any surviving examples of this variety are exceedingly rare and valuable today.|$|E
25|$|Art historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} the overall structure was designed by Hubert {{in the early to}} mid 1420s, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. One of the most renowned and important paintings in art history, generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passage to either brother, however no convincing separation has been established. The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant and Ghent mayor Jodocus Vijd and his wife Lysbette {{as part of a larger}} project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. The altarpiece's installation was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. It was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains. While indebted to the International Gothic as well as Byzantine and Romanic traditions, the altarpiece represented a huge advancement in art, in which the idealisation of the medieval tradition gave way to an exacting observation of nature and human representation. A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck maior quo nemo repertus (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself arte secundus (second best in the art)—completed it in 1432. The original, very ornate carved <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted tracery, was destroyed during the Reformation; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even playing music.|$|E
500|$|The trophy was {{designed}} by Jeroen Tirion and consists of a thick square frame, containing a film frame of the awarded movie. The <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> is made of milled wood, which has a plate attached to it, on the first line inscribed with the text [...] "Gouden Film", three squares, and the year, and on the second line with the film's title.|$|E
50|$|The outside {{frames of}} the Dukes were curved upwards over {{each pair of}} driving wheels. Inner and <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> were 3/4 in thick. The first 40 {{members of the class}} were fitted with Mansell pattern bogie wheels with wooden centres. The first 25 tenders built also had Mansell pattern wheels, and a shorter than normal {{wheelbase}} of 11 ft so that the locomotives would fit on the smaller turntables then in use west of Newton Abbot. The engine bogie was of a centre-less type designed by Dean.|$|R

500|$|The madrasa was {{completely}} rebuilt by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda, {{leaving only the}} southeastern wall and its mihrab untouched. The mihrab was described by K. A. C. Creswell as being [...] "one of the finest in Cairo". The niche of the mihrab is [...] wide and [...] deep. On {{each side of the}} niche stands a [...] high porphyry column. Above the columns are impost blocks decorated with colored geometrical designs. The semi-dome {{at the top of the}} mihrab is set within an outer arch. Surrounding this arch is a molding that forms a rectangular <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> This is the first mihrab in Egypt to have this type of frame.|$|E
500|$|Kohn {{regarded}} its visuals as {{the pinnacle}} of the show. Sava wrote {{that the notion of}} time being a flat circle could have inspired the circular shape of the inner frame. He noted the use of color beyond the circle as a way to convey the many emotions evoked for the whole of the episode. Ignoring this device, Sava saw its use as humorous diversions while it contributed to the splendor. Nussbaum described the creatures appearing in the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> as annotative and a mute chorus, suggesting they live in a parallel universe of both connection and isolation. The episode was later released on DVD twice, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Princess Day box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. Home video critic Justin Remer called [...] "Bad Timing" [...] "surprisingly devastating" [...] in DVD Talk. Kohn summed up the episode's climax as the [...] of Adventure Time.|$|E
2500|$|The text/picture {{blocks in}} the Bibles Moralisées are {{striking}} for their symmetry. Each of the pages hold 8 medallions with painted gold backgrounds, these 8 medallions are arranged in pairs, so 4 rows of two medallions. Where the medallions touch one another a stylized flower joins the two, similar flowers mark where the medallions touch the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> and the spaces between the medallions are decorated using squares placed over quatrefoils, in these there are painted angel busts over a gold “ground”. [...] Each of the paintings within the medallions held figures that were painted on a gold leaf background, and are set on a patterned ground of blue or rose brown.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{details of}} the six New York-built vessels are available. These ships had frames, keels and keelsons of white oak [...] "of the best quality", with port {{stanchions}} of locust and live oak. The keels and keelsons were fastened with corrosion-resistant copper bolts. The hulls were strengthened with diagonal iron braces, secured amidships [...] "at {{the turn of the}} bilge" [...] and running upward at a 45° angle to the <b>outer</b> <b>frames.</b> The ship stems were also strengthened with iron strapping. According to some sources, ships of the class were built with unseasoned timber and would therefore have been expected to have short working lives.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the gong circle is made from a rattan vine which is {{smoothed}} and rounded into shape. Four lengths of the vine are taken to make one frame. The lengths are divided into two pairs, a shorter pair for the inner circle and a longer pair for the outer. The instrument is held up with 16 supports, made of neang nuen, krennoonf, or beng wood. The gong circle is held together with six crossbars, designed to keep {{the distance between the}} inner and <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> fixed. Copper wires are wrapped around the length of each support post, one on the inner and one on the outer.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} three bodies connected by gaiters, the two outer bodies with short cabinets. The chassis consisted of two short-coupled frames. Each of them contained two drive axles, one leading Bissel axle and one trailing Adams axle.The frames were - as with the Be 4/7 - coupled directly by a connecting rod and two auxiliary couplers. The outer bodies were fixed to the frames, while the centre body lay on a bridging slab, which did not transfer any tractive or pressure forces. The bridging slab rested on the <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> over a pivot, and via horizontal springs between the inner drive axles and the Adams axles.|$|R
2500|$|Patrick D. Miller in his {{commentary}} on Deuteronomy suggests that {{different views of}} the structure of the book will lead to different views on what it is about. The structure is often described as a series of three speeches or sermons (chapters 1:1–4:43, 4:44–29:1, 29:2–30:20) followed by a number of short appendices– Miller refers to this as the [...] "literary" [...] structure; alternatively, it is sometimes seen as a ring-structure with a central core (chapters 12–26, the Deuteronomic Code) and an inner and an <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> (chapters 4–11/27–30 and 1–3/31–34)– Miller calls this the covenantal substructure; and finally the theological structure revealed in the theme of the exclusive worship of Yahweh established in the first of the Ten Commandments ("Thou shalt have no other god before me") and the Shema.|$|E

She had {{to close the door}} of the hut and bar every chink and cranny against the icy air, that became at last a murderous, freezing wind. Not only did she line the hut with every scrap of skin and paper she could obtain, but she went out with the spade toiling for three laborious afternoons in piling and beating snow against the <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> And now it was that Trafford talked at last, talked with something of the persistence of delirium, and she sat and listened hour by hour, silently, for he gave no heed to her or to anything she might say. He talked, it seemed, to God....|$|E

40|$|Behavior of {{the first}} floor of the U. S. -Japan seven story {{reinforced}} concrete test structure was modeled by a finite element model. The constitutive matrix describing material behavior is a normal concrete model which included a smeared cracking capability. The computed response of the system was shown to have a dependence on the level of tension stiffening present in the concrete. The selection too Iowa value distorted the behavior observed in the model. The 3 -dimensional effects presented in the test structure was also observed in the computational model.

40|$|The Remodeling Conjecture {{proposed}} by Bouchard-Klemm-Mariño-Pasquetti (BKMP) [arXiv: 0709. 1453, arXiv: 0807. 0597] relates the A-model open and closed topological string amplitudes (the all genus open and closed Gromov-Witten invariants) of a semi-projective toric Calabi-Yau 3 -manifold/ 3 -orbifold to the Eynard-Orantin invariants of its mirror curve.

60|$|There {{was much}} to do to the hut. The absence of {{anything}} but stunted and impoverished timber and the limitation of time, had forbidden a log hut, and their home was really only a double framework, rammed tight between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> {{with a mixture of}} earth and boughs and twigs of willow, pine and balsam. The floor was hammered earth carpeted with balsam twigs and a caribou skin. Outside and within wall and roof were faced with coarse canvas--that was Trafford's idea--and their bunks occupied two sides of the hut. Heating was done by the sheet-iron stove they had brought with them, and the smoke was carried out to the roof by a thin sheet-iron pipe which had come up outside a roll of canvas. They had made the roof with about the pitch of a Swiss châlet, and it was covered with nailed waterproof canvas, held down by a large number of big lumps of stone. Much of the canvassing still remained to do when the men went down, and then the Traffords used every scrap of packing-paper and newspaper that had come up with them and was not needed for lining the bunks in covering any crack or join in the canvas wall.|$|E

50|$|The {{infill wall}} is the {{supported}} wall that closes {{the perimeter of}} a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure (generally made of steel or reinforced concrete). Therefore, the structural frame ensures the bearing function, whereas the infill wall serves to separate inner and outer space, filling up the boxes of the <b>outer</b> <b>frames.</b> The infill wall has the unique static function to bear its own weight. The infill wall is an external vertical opaque type of closure. With respect to other categories of wall, the infill wall differs from the partition that serves to separate two interior spaces, yet also non-load bearing, and from the load bearing wall. The latter performs the same functions of the infill wall, hygro-thermically and acoustically, but performs static functions too.|$|R
50|$|The 9.25 m span wide (30 ft) centre section, the {{structural}} {{core of the}} DB-70, was based on four steel transverse spars, separated vertically by 2.30 m (7 ft 6 in), horizontally by 1.95 m (6 ft 5 in) and cross-braced into six frames, forming five transverse bays. The two pairs of <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> defined the forward fuselages and the outer wings, engines and undercarriage legs were attached to the outermost frames. The centre engine was mounted on the central frame, positioned well forward of both the leading edge and of the planes of the two outer propellers. The whole structure was duralumin skinned to form an aerofoil section with a chord of about 10 m (33 ft), the lower surface continuing to form the undersides of the fuselages.|$|R
