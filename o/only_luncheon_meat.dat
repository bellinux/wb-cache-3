40|$|<b>Luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> {{was used}} as a model system {{for the study of the}} effect of colour on the {{acceptability}} of fond. Techniques of colour measurement, panel assessment and colour photography were established. Commercial <b>luncheon</b> <b>meats</b> were examined and parameters which characterised the colour and appearance of the product were evaluated. <b>Luncheon</b> <b>meats,</b> prepared in the laboratory by different chopping procedures but using the same ingredients, received variable acceptability scores in panel tests, attributable to differences in their homogeneity. The effect of various additives on <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> prepared by a standard chopping procedure was investigated. Sodium nitrite was added at levels ranging from 0 to 400 parts per million and acceptable pink cured colours developed at all concentrations above a threshold input level of ten parts per million. Erythrosine powder was examined at levels between 0 to 100 parts per million. In the absence of nitrite satisfactory pink, colours were found in the region of 8 to 10 parts per million erythrosin, but in the presence of nitrite, levels of 2. 5 parts per million erythrosine 5 parts per million nitrite were the minima acceptable. Other- colouring matters, Erythrosine Lake, Allura Red, Red 2 G, Red Iron Oxide and Carmine were also evaluated in the presence and absence of sodium nitrites. Results showed that the colours of these samples were inferior to those produced by the use of erythrosine powder...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} texture differences on satiation (ad libitum food intake) in 3 pairs of solid foods. Test products were specially developed <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat,</b> meat replacers and sweets. Each food consisted of a " hard" and " soft" version, expected to lead to different eating rates and consequently to differences in oral sensory exposure time. One hundred and six subjects participated in 7 sessions. During the first sessions, subjects consumed the products ad libitum while watching a movie in a cinema. During the last session, eating rate of all products was measured. Mean intake {{did not differ significantly}} between the hard and soft version for any of the products, but subjects who ate more of the soft <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> significantly outnumbered subjects who ate more of the hard version. Eating rate was significantly slower for the hard than for the soft <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> (21 ± 10 vs. 25 ± 13. g/min); no differences were found for the other food types. Ad libitum intake was twice as high in the highest versus the lowest quartile of eating rate (p< 0. 001). Texture differences between the hard and soft versions may have been too subtle to lead to differences in eating rate for meat replacers and sweets and consequently to differences in food intake. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The term olive loaf {{can refer}} to two {{different}} food products. Primarily, it {{is a type of}} meatloaf or cold cut embedded with pimento-stuffed green olives. A secondary meaning is that of olive bread, a bread where the loaf of bread is laced with whole olives.The <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> often also contains garlic, basil or sweet peppers for additional flavor. Olive loaf is a loaf-type <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat,</b> traditionally cooked in a loaf pan as opposed to a sausage cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive loaf is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive loaf contains mostly chicken or turkey. Since most less expensive bologna is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive loaf in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive loaf is a sausage like bologna.|$|R

40|$|Background: Ready-to-eat (RTE) {{foods are}} {{considered}} a high risk food group, since they are often consumed without a cooking step. <b>Luncheon</b> <b>meat,</b> a RTE food widely consumed in Brazil, is traditionally produced as industrially vacuum-packaged loaves and afterwards is sliced and re-packaged at retail stores. Since this practice may pose an additional hazard of contamination, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate total coliform counts (TCC), coagulase-positive staphylococci counts (CPS), and the occurrence of Escherichia coli and Listeria sp. in <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> samples sliced and packaged at supermarkets. Materials, Methods & Results: Three supermarket stores belonging to either regional or national chains located in Porto Alegre were intentionally chosen, and <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> samples were purchased from the same sampled stores weekly during a 20 -week period. In each sampling event, five store-packaged <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> samples were obtained and analyzed. Individual samples (25 g) were homogenized, decimally diluted in buffered peptone water and submitted to TCC in Violet Red Bile Agar. Thermotolerant coliform (FC) were confirmed in EC broth incubated at 45 °C. Confirmed tubes were streaked on McConkey agar and submitted to E. coli identification. Isolation and enumeration of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) were performed on Baird-Parker agar. The presence of Listeria sp. was tested in pooled samples submitted to pre-enrichment in University of Vermont (UVM) Listeria Enrichment broth, followed by incubation in Fraser broth and isolation on tryptose agar with nalidixic acid and Palcam agar. TCC mean varied from 1. 2 log 10 CFU. g- 1 (store B) to 5. 5 log 10 CFU. g- 1 (store C), while CPS mean counts were similar (0. 63; 0. 65 and 0. 86 log 10 CFU. g- 1) for samples purchased at the three stores. Considering Brazilian standards for FCC, in stores A (n= 6) and C (n= 8) samples considered unsafe (above 3 log. g- 1) were found, while all samples purchased at store B are considered sound according to that standard. Moreover, three samples from each store (A and C) confirmed for the presence of E. coli. Samples contaminated with Listeria sp. (n= 16) were also found. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from six samples, and was found in all sampled supermarkets. A trend of Listeria sp. isolation frequency in samples with higher TCC was observed. Discussion: The results demonstrated that bacteria may be introduced in <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> during the slicing and packaging at supermarkets. Our data are in accordance with other reports that indicate slicing as a critical control point of contamination and transfer of pathogen, including L. monocytogenes, to foods during processing. Differences observed on extend of product contamination may have resulted from variable levels of cleanliness during handling and slicing procedures at the three supermarkets. Specifically, the cleaning of equipment surfaces represents a challenge for sanitation programs, since most equipment is not hygienically designed and must be unassembled prior to sanitization procedures. This fact may lead to the decrease of cleaning and disinfection frequency and to the hazard of biofilm formation. In conclusion, <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> sliced and packaged in supermarkets may pose a hazard to the consumers, and the adoption of more rigorous disinfection protocols for equipment and surfaces in contact with ready-to-eat foods in these stores is advisable...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally a quiver-tip rod is {{used with}} at least 4 pound line rating due to {{the weight of the}} ledger/feeder (heavier weights need heavier line). In feeder fishing, bait will be put on a hook and inside a swim-feeder which the current will cause to flow out and attract fish to the hook's {{position}} so it involves fishing upstream of where the fish are, this usually involves smaller baits like sweetcorn or maggots. The same applies to ledgering except there is a weight (called a ledger) instead of a swim-feeder and usually heavier baits are used here such as <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat.</b> Another method known as touch-ledgering can be used which involves not using a quiver-tip but instead holding the line that is loose off the reel and feeling for any pulls or the line going loose. Some anglers do this without any weights and let the bait slowly drift downstream with the line steadily moving through their hands, slugs and <b>luncheon</b> <b>meat</b> are excellent for this method.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} a food is {{contaminated}} with pathogens (harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or protozoa) may, or may not, render it adulterated.
