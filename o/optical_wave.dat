These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces cross-talk between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.|$|E
25|$|In {{birefringent}} media {{there is}} no attenuation but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change unless its polarization direction is identical {{to one of those}} basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, Fizeau {{noted that}} the purpose of the {{arrangement}} of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a Fourier transform of the <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as astronomical interferometry. It was not until 1891 that Albert A. Michelson successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson & Francis G. Pease (1921) which was applied by their 20ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the 100 inch Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the generation of}} acoustic phonons from electrostriction of <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> in small core waveguides. We specifically consider simple step-index strip waveguides composed of silica or silicon in air, with sub-micron lateral dimensions. Such waveguides support {{one or a few}} optical modes, but a rich spectrum of acoustic phonons that becomes densely populated as the phonon frequency increases. We evaluate rigorously the phonon energy density that results from the electrostriction of two frequency detuned guided <b>optical</b> <b>waves,</b> that are either co- or contra-propagating, including phonon loss. Plotting this energy density as a function of frequency detuning reveals the phonon wave packets that are electrostrictively active and gives a quantitative estimation of the energy transfer from <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> to particular phonons. Furthermore, in the backward interaction geometry, the dispersion relation of such phonons can be accessed directly by varying the optical wavelength...|$|R

25|$|Media {{that have}} {{different}} indexes of refraction for different polarization modes are called birefringent. Well known manifestations of this effect appear in <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, {{this is the}} case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of stimulated {{emission}} (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in proximity to one another, without recombining, for a certain time, termed the [...] "upper-state lifetime" [...] or [...] "recombination time" [...] (about a nanosecond for typical diode laser materials), before they recombine. A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling {{in the same direction}} as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an <b>optical</b> <b>wave</b> (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases. The spontaneous and stimulated emission processes are vastly more efficient in direct bandgap semiconductors than in indirect bandgap semiconductors; therefore silicon is not a common material for laser diodes.|$|E

40|$|We propose, {{analyze and}} {{demonstrate}} the optoelectronic phase-locking of <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> whose frequencies are chirped continuously and rapidly with time. The <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> {{are derived from}} a common optoelectronic swept-frequency laser based on a semiconductor laser in a negative feedback loop, with a precisely linear frequency chirp of 400 GHz in 2 ms. In contrast to monochromatic waves, a differential delay between two linearly chirped <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> results in a mutual frequency difference, and an acoustooptic frequency shifter is therefore used to phase-lock the two waves. We demonstrate and characterize homodyne and heterodyne optical phase-locked loops with rapidly chirped waves, and show the ability to precisely control the phase of the chirped optical waveform using a digital electronic oscillator. A loop bandwidth of ∼ 60 kHz, and a residual phase error variance of < 0. 01 rad^ 2 between the chirped waves is obtained. Further, we demonstrate the simultaneous phase-locking of two optical paths to a common master waveform, {{and the ability to}} electronically control the resultant two-element optical phased array.

40|$|A new {{scheme of}} optical pulse {{generation}} using multiple optoelectronic phase locked loops is proposed. The {{principle of the}} scheme is combining three or more coherent <b>optical</b> <b>waves</b> having equal frequency separation.

The repetition frequency of the generated optical pulse is equal to the frequency of the reference microwave / millimeter wave signal source used in the phase locked loop. The intensity profile of the generated optical pulse and the pulse width are calculated. If four coherent optical carriers are combined, the generated optical pulse has a typical width of 2. 4 picoseconds. In the proposed scheme the central frequency of the optical pulse and the repetition frequency can be varied.

A typical NAND gate is a logic device with one bias and two logic input and one output ports. It has four different combinations for its logic input ports. The output port of the NAND gate is OFF, when both logic ports are ON, otherwise the output port will be ON. The switching power threshold obtained for this structure equals to 1. 5 kW/μm 2. For designing the proposed optical logic gate we employed one resonant ring whose resonant wavelength is at 1554 nm.
