5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, {{was traded to the}} Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his head <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record.

5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

25|$|In 1942 Eric Cross' book The Tailor and Ansty {{was banned}} by the Board. The book was a {{collection}} of stories and sayings from an old country tailor called Timothy Buckley and his wife Anastasia that the author had recorded. Although they were exactly the type of Irish people romanticised by de Valera, their real-life language was too broad and racy for the Censorship Board. After the book was banned, three priests forced Buckely to go <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> burn the book in his own fireplace.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} {{expedition}} {{was that of}} Tore Hund (Tore Dog) who together with some friends, arrived in Bjarmaland in 1026.

Later, they made shore in secret, and plundered the burial site, where the Bjarmians had erected an idol of their god Jomali. This god had a bowl containing silver <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> a valuable chain around his neck.

25|$|In early 1812, a seaman named Oakey struck Collier. The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} {{sentenced him to}} death. His plea for a stay of execution was denied, and every ship in port sent a boat of seamen to witness the hanging. Oakey came on deck with his arms tied behind him, attended by the Chaplain. However, after the sentence of the Court Martial had been read Captain Hall produced {{a letter from the}} Prince Regent that, at Collier's request, commuted Oakey's sentence to transportation. The reprieve stunned Oakey, who fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> wept.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{raised the}} money to pay the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but without their consent and {{contrary}} to their wishes. [...] As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening, he was able to forbid the payment of his fine as a matter of conscience, though friends attempted to pay for him as well. [...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have struck me as with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> elbows for many days afterwards. [...] Much later, Rhode Island Governor Joseph Jenckes wrote, [...] "Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes' back (which the old man was wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus), have expressed a wonder that he should live." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norwich in {{the late}} 17th century was riven politically. Churchman Humphrey Prideaux {{described}} [...] "two factions, Whig and Tory [...] and both contend for their way with the utmost violence." [...] Nor did the city accept {{the outcome of the}} 1688 Glorious Revolution with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse [...] "with a glass of beer in hand, went down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [...] well and settled on his head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} midshipman who had distinguished himself to Captain Pigot {{during the previous}} months, but his disrating was a primary trigger to the mutiny. [...] About {{a week before the}} mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed a reef knot which had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. [...] Casey was brought before the captain, and while he took full responsibly for it, Pigot further demanded that Casey get <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> beg for forgiveness. This would have been a terrible insult for a gentleman, and Casey refused. The captain gave him 12 lashes, and he was disrated, which would end his career as a naval officer. [...] The crew felt Casey was punished unfairly, and the topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins {{went on a}} four-day {{drinking}} binge. With the urging of Cash, he opened a show in San Diego, California, by playing four songs after seeing [...] "four or five of me in the mirror" [...] and while {{being able to see}} [...] "nothin' but a blur". After drinking yet another pint of whiskey, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating [...] "big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me". The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Lord,... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and,</b> with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
