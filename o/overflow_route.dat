Later work (by Moffat and Catt, 1982; Avery and Catt, 1983; Green and McGregor, 1983), which matched gravel deposits in the Vale of St Albans with those in the modern lower Thames valley suggests that the Finchley <b>overflow</b> <b>route</b> is unlikely.and that once ponded back by the ice the primordial Thames overflowed directly into its current route around Staines.|$|E
50|$|The {{trail to}} Cedar Sink follows the Smith Valley floor for about ¾ mile. The trail is 1.6 miles round trip and circles the {{southern}} edge of the sink and eventually leads to a platform overlooking the sink. The trail is clearly delineated with many stairs leading {{to the bottom of the}} sink and there are several vista platforms along the ridge. The trail offers many glimpses at the once underground river system. The views from the plateau change depending on the weather; there are many ephemeral springs at the south end of the sink. The <b>overflow</b> <b>route</b> is dry at times and flowing strongly at other during high precipitation events. The main channel flow is often not at the surface throughout many parts of this region.|$|E

Whereas brokers and banks may buy and sell the same stocks or bonds with each other in the same day, carriers have to be very careful not to do so. For example, if carrier A buys USA from carrier B who buys it from A, one call will come in to carrier A, go to B and return to A, continually until all the circuits are taken up with the one call. If it does terminate on an <b>overflow</b> <b>route,</b> the carriers may bill each other many times over for the same call. This is called looping and is very undesirable.|$|E
5000|$|The Beighton Branch {{also served}} as an <b>overflow</b> and diversionary <b>route</b> for the GCML, with {{northbound}} trains leaving the latter at Kirkby South Junction and travelling up the Leen Valley Extension through [...] to Langwith Junction then to Sheffield using the route described above, regaining the GCML at Killamarsh North Junction. Southbound trains reversed the process.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the teletraffic modelling and performance of layered cellular networks that use overflow for new call and handover attempts in order to improve system performance It addresses the important problems how to model and analyse overflow in large cellular networks so that the overall impact across the network can be evaluated, the overflow policies that can be used with new calls and handovers to improve network performance and how these policies perform under a range of conditions. The general problem of modelling overflow in cellular networks is considered at length and from this it is concluded that the use of overflow in existing schemes such as directed retry, reuse partitioning and overlaid cells can also be described by the simple concepts of intra and inter layer overflow Using these concepts the author formulates the problem of overflow in layered networks as a subset of the general problem of overflow with multiple <b>overflow</b> <b>routes</b> and restricted <b>overflow.</b> This leads to the derivation of the mean and variance of the overflow traffic from a cell with multiple handover routes and restricted handover from the two-dimensional birth death model of the system. These expressions for the mean and variance are used in conjunction with the Equivalent Random Theory and splitting formulae {{in the development of the}} Splitting Formula Method or SF Method. The accuracy of three splitting formulae and a simple Poisson approximation are investigated and compared with simulation. From this we conclude that the splitting formulae of Akimaru and Takahashi and Wallstrom provide the best overall result. This method is used to solve the general problem of multiple user classes for an example two layer network. This leads to conclusions on the complex relationship between cell capacity, the proportion of uses that can access the microcells and the proportion of users that can overflow from the microcell to the macrocell. The Modified Splitting Formula Method is an extension of the SF Method that includes handovers and overflow for handovers. A user perceived measure of the effect of new call and handover blocking described by the probability of call failure augments the Modified SF method. This is then used to analyse five new call overflow policies for a three layer network under conditions of extended handover, restrictions on handover for calls in cells at the edge of layers and spatial offset between the peak of the traffic demand and the cell layout. The results give new and valuable insight into the behaviour of layered cellular networks with overflow and the trade-offs in performance that exist when designing and operating these networks...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{establish}} real-time connections with guaranteed qualityof -services, based on per-session (oe; ae) -characterization. Under two distinctive service disciplines, rate proportional processor sharing and fixed rate processor sharing, we derive tighter probabilistic bounds on per-session end-to-end average cell loss rate, which is caused by either buffer <b>overflow</b> in the <b>route</b> or excessive delay at the destination. One remarkable feature of the bounding solutions {{is that they are}} solely determined by the probabilistic (oe; ae) -characterization of each session itself, independent of the network environment and other connections. To improve network resource utilization, our method is extended to allow statistical sharing of buffer resources at each node. The admission control scheme presented in this paper has a great flexibility in connection management since both bandwidth and buffer resources can be adaptively allocated among incoming and existing sessi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{representative}} of {{a large group of}} pseudomonad bacteria that possess coexisting alternative pathways to L-phenylalanine (as well as to L-tyrosine). These multiple flow routes to aromatic end products apparently account for the inordinate resistance of P. aeruginosa to end product analogs. Manipulation of carbon source nutrition produced a physiological state of sensitivity to p-fluorophenylalanine and m-fluorophenylalanine, each a specific antimetabolite of L-phenylalanine. Analog-resistant mutants obtained fell into two classes. One type lacked feedback sensitivity of prephenate dehydratase and was the most dramatic excretor of L-phenylalanine. The presence of L-tyrosine curbed phenylalanine excretion to one-third, a finding explained by potent early-pathway regulation of 3 -deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7 -phosphate (DAHP) synthase-Tyr (a DAHP synthase subject to allosteric inhibition by L-tyrosine). The second class of regulatory mutants possessed a completely feedback-resistant DAHP synthase-Tyr, the major species (greater than 90 %) of two isozymes. Deregulation of DAHP synthase-Tyr resulted in the escape of most chorismate molecules produced into an unregulated <b>overflow</b> <b>route</b> consisting of chorismate mutase (monofunctional), prephenate aminotransferase, and arogenate dehydratase. In the wild type the operation of the overflow pathway is restrained by factors that restrict early-pathway flux. These factors include the highly potent feedback control of DAHP synthase isozymes by end products as well as the strikingly variable abilities of different carbon source nutrients to supply the aromatic pathway with beginning substrates. Even in the wild type, where all allosteric regulation in intact, some phenylalanine overflow was found on glucose-based medium, but not on fructose-based medium. This carbon source-dependent difference was much more exaggerated in each class of regulatory mutants...|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, over 10 {{million tons}} of {{ultrafine}} coal wastes are discarded every year, typically {{in the form of}} ultrafine slurries. These fines have a high calorific value, and contain sulfur minerals, particularly pyrite. The high calorific value of these discards leads to a waste of energy that could be harnessed and used, while the high sulfur content contributes to adverse environmental effects such as acid rock drainage (ARD). The University of Cape Town (UCT) has developed a two-stage flotation process, which involves coal flotation in the first stage and pyrite flotation of the tailings in the second stage, for mitigating the ARD potential of ultrafine wastes. Research has shown that this two stage froth flotation process was sufficient to render the tailings non-acid forming. At the same time, North West University (NWU) has been carrying out research on coal fines using the recently invented reflux classifier. The reflux classifier is claimed to be capable of separating particles down to 38 ìm in size; however, no work has been done using the reflux classifier to separate pyrite from coal. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of combining flotation and reflux classification for removing sulfide minerals from two South African coal ultrafines, whilst recovering valuable coal, and compares the results to those obtained using the UCT two-stage flotation process. As no previous work has been done using reflux classification to remove sulfide minerals from coal, {{this is the first time}} that the reflux classifier will be investigated for this purpose. Two process routes were investigated: (i) froth flotation followed by reflux classification of the tailings (process route 1), and (ii) reflux classification followed by froth flotation of the <b>overflow</b> (process <b>route</b> 2). Coal flotation, sulfide flotation and reflux classification were conducted on samples of Waterberg and Witbank coals, using a 3 L Leeds-type flotation cell and a 10 L batch reflux classifier constructed at NWU. Acid base accounting (ABA) and net acid generating (NAG) static characterization tests were performed on the products and feeds from all three process routes...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{methodology for}} distributed rainfall-runoff modelling using grid square weather radar data is developed {{for use in}} real-time flood forecasting. The model, called the Grid Model, is configured so as to share the same grid as used by the weather radar, thereby exploiting the distributed rainfall estimates to the full. Each grid square in the catchment is conceptualised as a storage which receives water as precipitation and generates water by overflow and drainage. This water is routed across the catchment using isochrone pathways. These are derived from a digital terrain model assuming two fixed velocities of travel for land and river pathways which are regarded as model parameters to be optimised. Translation of water between isochrones is achieved using a discrete kinematic routing procedure, parameterised through a single dimensionless wave speed parameter, which advects the water and incorporates diffusion effects through the discrete space-time formulation. The basic model <b>routes</b> <b>overflow</b> and drainage separately through a parallel system of kinematic routing reaches, characterised by different wave speeds but using the same isochrone-based space discretisation; these represent fast and slow pathways to the basin outlet, respectively. A variant allows the slow pathway to have separate isochrones calculated using Darcy velocities controlled by the hydraulic gradient as estimated by the local gradient of the terrain. Runoff production within a grid square is controlled by its absorption capacity which is parameterised through a simple linkage function to the mean gradient in the square, as calculated from digital terrain data. This allows absorption capacity to be specified differently for every grid square in the catchment {{through the use of}} only two regional parameters and a DTM measurement of mean gradient for each square. An extension of this basic idea to consider the distribution of gradient within the square leads analytically to a Pareto distribution of absorption capacity, given a power distribution of gradient within the square. The probability-distributed model theory (Moore, 1985) can then be used directly to obtain the integrated runoff production for the square for routing to the catchment outlet. justification for the simple linkage function is in part sought through consideration of variants on the basic model where (i) runoff production is based on a topographic index control on saturation and (ii) absorption capacity is related to the Integrated Air Capacity of the soil, as obtained from soil survey. An impervious area fraction is also introduced based on the use of Landsat classified urban areas. The Grid Model and its variants are assessed in Part 2 (Bell and Moore, 1998), first as simulation models and then as forecasting models, following the development of updating procedures to accommodate recent observations of flow so as to improve forecast performance in a real-time context...|$|R
