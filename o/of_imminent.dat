5|$|Al-Qaeda {{had begun}} reconnoitering Nairobi for {{potential}} targets in December 1993, using {{a team led}} by Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> attacks.|$|E

An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E

5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fred was the easternmost Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{to form in}} the tropics, and {{the first}} to move through Cape Verde since 1892. The second hurricane and sixth named storm of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Fred originated from a well-defined tropical wave over West Africa in late August2015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable tropospheric environment and strengthened into a tropical storm on August30. The following day, Fred grew to a Category1 hurricane with peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing Boa Vista and moving away from Santo Antão, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September1. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile wind shear, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September45. Curving sharply to the north, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably by September6, and the storm dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Darlington made {{unsuccessful}} {{approaches to}} sign international stars Paul Gascoigne and Faustino Asprilla, {{and moved into}} their new stadium, named the Reynolds Arena, in summer 2003. Reynolds had paid the club's debts when he took over, {{but the cost of}} the stadium, partly financed with high-interest loans and built without realistic expectation of filling it, drove the club into administration six months later. Reynolds resigned as a director in January 2004 with the club under threat <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> closure. A benefit match, featuring footballers such as Gascoigne, Bryan Robson and Kenny Dalglish, played in front of a crowd of over 14,000, raised £100,000 to help ensure survival in the short term. Despite the off-field problems, David Hodgson, in his third spell as manager, and his players produced some fine performances as the team avoided relegation.|$|E

5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations because the United States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis gripped the New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated {{the sale of the}} University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, {{he met with the}} Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E

5|$|Planned by the London Controlling Section, Ironside was {{communicated to}} the Germans via double agents between May and June 1944. Unlike other Bodyguard deceptions, the plan was put across entirely by double agents without support by {{physical}} deception. Agent Bronx took the lead with support from Tate, Rudloff and Garbo. Ironside's story included an initial two-division assault, using Overlord formations, staged out of the United Kingdom. This would then be followed up with six divisions sailing from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Historians disagree on the impact of Ironside on German plans. There is no indication that the operation was successful in convincing the Germans <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> Allied plans to invade the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, Allied planners attributed the delay of a panzer division moving to Normandy in part to the deception.|$|E
5|$|Steinhaus, {{because of}} his Jewish background, spent the Nazi {{occupation}} in hiding, first among friends in Lwów, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamość and Berdechów, near Kraków. The Polish anti-Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier, {{by the name of}} Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} sense <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> threat in Grand Forks, but the cities could not prepare {{for such an}} {{enormous}} flood. The National Weather Service (NWS) had a long-standing forecast for the river to crest at 49feet (14.9m), which was the river's highest level during the 1979 flood. The cities {{had been able to}} get their dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it, to the astonishment of the NWS (which did not upgrade its forecast until April 16, the day the river actually reached 49feet). The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing so early on April 18. Other dikes over the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area would fail that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes.|$|E

Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, about 150 men {{landed at}} Cape Murro di Porco and {{captured}} a radio station. Based on a warning <b>of</b> <b>imminent</b> glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops {{failed to get}} the message. The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the brigade's favour as {{they were able to}} cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces at the bridge came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men at the bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it. The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far. They amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were missing or wounded.|$|E
