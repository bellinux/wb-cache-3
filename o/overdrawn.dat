5|$|The film Casablanca was a {{plot device}} in the science-fiction {{television}} movie <b>Overdrawn</b> at the Memory Bank (1983), based on John Varley's story. It {{was referred to}} in Terry Gilliam's dystopian Brazil (1985). Warner Bros. produced its own parody in the homage Carrotblanca, a 1995 Bugs Bunny cartoon. In Casablanca, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick's Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film La La Land contains multiple allusions to Casablanca in the imagery, dialogue, and plot.|$|E
5|$|Wachovia Bank also filed {{a federal}} suit in October 2007 in Atlanta seeking about $940,000 from Vick and Gerald Frank Jenkins, a {{business}} partner. The bank claimed {{the two men}} and their business, Atlantic Wine & Package LLC, defaulted on a May 2006 loan of $1.3 million {{to set up a}} wine shop and restaurant. Jenkins, a retired surgeon who owned Atlantic Wine since 2004, brought Vick in as an investor. In May 2008, the U.S. District Court in Atlanta granted a summary judgment in favor of Wachovia. The judgment of $1.11 million included the initial principal balance, interest accrued, fees, <b>overdrawn</b> accounts, and legal fees. The order provided that further interest could be accrued.|$|E

25|$|The {{bank account}} balance is the {{financial}} position between {{the bank and}} the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is <b>overdrawn,</b> the customer owes the balance to the bank.|$|E
25|$|Romney's budget {{proposals}} included savings he anticipated achieving by {{restructuring the}} state government. On announcing his 2004 budget proposal, {{he said that}} through improving efficiency by reorganizing the state bureaucracy, along with reducing waste and fraud, he would save $2 billion. Democratic legislators and independent analysts called that estimate vastly <b>overdrawn.</b> The Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation, a nonpartisan, business-funded organization that monitors state finances, suggested the figure might have been closer to $100 million, and Romney himself was eventually forced to concede that the $2 billion figure {{could not be reached}} without new revenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is <b>overdrawn,</b> {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E
25|$|Abagnale's early {{confidence}} tricks included writing personal cheque {{on his own}} <b>overdrawn</b> account. This, however, {{would only}} work for a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so {{he moved on to}} opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time through experimentation, he developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks such as payroll checks, depositing them, and encouraging banks to advance him cash {{on the basis of his}} account balances. Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Juliá played Calibanos in Mazursky's Tempest and Ray in {{the musical}} One from the Heart. In 1983, his first son with Poloway, Raúl Sigmund Juliá was born. That year he also starred in the public {{television}} film <b>Overdrawn</b> at the Memory Bank, which received a weak reception and was satirized on Mystery Science Theater 3000. After not appearing in a film for two years, Juliá played a political prisoner named Valentín in an adaptation of Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman. Considering that the script was unique, he agreed to begin filming before receiving his salary and traveled to South America, where he interviewed rebels and ex-prisoners to familiarize himself with their experiences and ideology. Upon its release, the film was a commercial success. For his performance, Juliá received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award and won the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures' award for best actor along with co-lead actor William Hurt.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking the}} throne, the Yongzheng Emperor {{suppressed}} writings he deemed unfavorable to his court, particularly {{those with an}} anti-Manchu bias. Foremost among these were those of Zeng Jing, an unsuccessful degree candidate heavily influenced by the 17th-century scholar Lü Liuliang. Zeng had been so affected by what he read that he attempted to incite the governor-general of Shaanxi-Sichuan, Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of anti-Jurchen General Yue Fei), to rebel against the Qing government. Yue Zhongqi promptly turned him in, and in 1730 news of the case reached the Yongzheng Emperor. Highly concerned with {{the implications of the}} case, the emperor had Zeng Jing brought to Beijing for trial. The emperor's verdict seemed to demonstrate a Confucian sovereign's benevolence: He ascribed Zeng's actions to the gullibility and naïveté of a youth taken in by Lü Liuliang's abusive and <b>overdrawn</b> rhetoric. In addition, the emperor suggested that Lü Liuliang's original attack on the Manchus was misplaced, since they had been transformed by their long-term exposure to the civilising force of Confucianism.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main claims to unwind {{substantive}} transactions that could unjustly enrich some creditors' {{at the expense}} of others. First, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 declare every transaction void which is entered after the presentation of a winding up petition, unless approved by a court. In Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd Buckley LJ held that courts would habitually approve all contracts that were plainly beneficial to a company entered into in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The predominant purpose of the provision is to ensure unsecured creditors are not prejudiced, and the company's assets are not unduly depleted. However, in Re Gray's Inn because a host of transactions honoured by the company's bank, in an <b>overdrawn</b> account, between the presentation and the winding up petition were being granted, this meant unprofitable trading. So, the deals were declared void. In Hollicourt (Contracts) Ltd v Bank of Ireland, the Court of Appeal held that a bank itself which allows overpayments will not be liable to secondarily creditors if transactions are subsequently declared void. It took the view that a bank is not unjustly enriched, despite any fees for its services the bank may receive. Second, under IA 1986 section 238, transactions at an undervalue may be avoided regardless of their purpose, but only up to two years before the onset of insolvency. For example, in Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd the liquidators of an insolvent company, AJ Bekhor Ltd, claimed rescind the transfer of assets to a subsidiary, whose shares were then purchased by the investment management house Brewin Dolphin for £1. The only other consideration given by Brewin Dolphin was the promise to carry out a lease agreement for computers, which itself was likely to be unwound and therefore worthless. The House of Lords held that the total package of connected transactions could be taken into account to decide whether a transaction was undervalued or not, and held that this one was.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by film critics. The first {{review of the}} film in the The Moving Picture World found no fault with the acting and photography, but {{did not believe the}} ending was believable. The second review was more favorable, but again noted the scenario is a cautionary one for women without aid or occupation to support themselves in life. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "A number of <b>overdrawn</b> and inconsistent incidents in this film story do not rob it of its interesting strength. The acting is good and the scenic backgrounds appropriate." [...] However, the reviewer makes references to the plot that are not consistent with the official synopsis. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{rainfall}} {{recorded on}} September 13–14, 1928, remains {{the record for}} the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in Puerto Rico within a period of forty-eight hours.

500|$|In 1907, {{journalist}} Lindsay Denison {{complained that}} Sunday preached [...] "the old, old doctrine of damnation", getting results by [...] "inspiring fear and gloom {{in the hearts}} of sinners."In spite of his conviction that the truly religious man should take his religion joyfully, he gets his results by inspiring fear and gloom {{in the hearts of}} sinners.

But Sunday himself told reporters [...] "with ill-concealed annoyance", that his revivals had [...] "no emotionalism." [...] Certainly contemporary comparisons to the extravagances of mid-nineteenth-century camp meetings—as in the famous drawing by George Bellows—were <b>overdrawn.</b> Sunday told one reporter that he believed that people could [...] "be converted without any fuss," [...] and, at Sunday's meetings, [...] "instances of spasm, shakes, or fainting fits caused by hysteria were few and far between." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding not {{specifically}} teachers, {{but rather a}} type of adult characterization in general, Art Silverblatt asserts that the [...] "adults in Ferris Bueller's Day Off are irrelevant and impotent. Ferris's nemesis, the school disciplinarian, Mr. Rooney, is obsessed with 'getting Bueller.' His obsession emerges from envy. Strangely, Ferris serves as Rooney's role model, as he clearly possesses the imagination and power that Rooney lacks. ... By capturing and disempowering Ferris, Rooney hopes to ... reduce Ferris's influence over other students, which would reestablish adults, that is, Rooney, as traditional authority figures." [...] Nevertheless, Silverblatt concludes that [...] "Rooney is essentially a comedic figure, whose bumbling attempts to discipline Ferris are a primary source of humor in the film". Thomas Patrick Doherty writes that [...] "the adult villains in teenpics such as ... Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) are <b>overdrawn</b> caricatures, no real threat; they're played for laughs". Yet Silverblatt also remarks that casting [...] "the principal as a comic figure questions the competence of adults to provide young people with effective direction—indeed, the value of adulthood itself".|$|E
500|$|Wings for My Flight was {{originally}} published in hardcover by Addison-Wesley in 1991. The book was republished in 1999 by Pruett Publishing with a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. The book was updated again in 2014 and republished by the University of New Mexico Press with photographs and a preface by Houle touching upon {{the recovery of the}} peregrine falcon. In May 1996, the children's magazine Cricket published a short story written by Houle titled [...] "Albert", adapted from Wings for My Flight. Reception to Wings for My Flight has generally been positive. In 1991, the book co-received the Oregon Book Award, which promotes literature by Oregon-based authors. Wings for My Flight was also awarded a Christopher Award for books in 1992, which recognizes works that [...] "affirm the highest values of the human spirit". The Library Journal described it as [...] "well-crafted and compelling", while the Los Angeles Times referred to it as [...] "heartfelt", although [...] "naive and <b>overdrawn</b> at times".|$|E
500|$|Freehance writer Paul De Witte wrote a mixed {{review in}} The Record (now the Waterloo Region Record), writing that {{although}} the book [...] "will certainly find its audience, its Disneyesque sensibilities will kill its broader appeal.

[...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and <b>overdrawn</b> at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles {{to even the most}} stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but {{to those of us who}} get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Edna {{announced}} that she was leaving Skelton but would continue to manage his career and write material for him. He did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC. They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm. The couple did not discuss {{the reasons for their}} divorce and Edna initially prepared to work as a script writer for other radio programs. [...] When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity. [...] Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was <b>overdrawn.</b> Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets. She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.|$|E
500|$|McEwen {{was caught}} up in the House banking scandal, which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich, a like-minded {{conservative}} House Republican, {{as an example of the}} corruption of Congress; members of the House had been allowed to write checks on their accounts, which were paid despite insufficient funds and without penalty. Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News said [...] "McEwen was collateral damage" [...] to Gingrich's crusade. McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks. Later, he admitted he had bounced a few. Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an <b>overdrawn</b> account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative's next paycheck. In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the franking privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas.|$|E

The cuts {{came at a}} time when the row over the legality of unauthorised borrowing reached the House of Lords. The fees were estimated to earn current account providers about £2.6bn a year. The Consumers' Association chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, said: [...] "This is a step in the right direction and a victory for consumer pressure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trade on {{the upper}} part of the {{navigation}} to Stowmarket was extremely limited, with just an occasional barge carrying manure to Prentice's Manure Works, and returning with guncotton, which was manufactured at an explosives works. There was more traffic between Ipswich and Bramford, as barges regularly worked to Fison's and Packard's factories. The companies paid lower tolls because they helped to maintain the lock gates and clear weeds from the channel. 30-ton barges were worked through the lower four locks in trains of two dumb barges with a steam-powered barge pulling them. By 1917, the undertaking was virtually bankrupt. Income amounted to around £220 per year, with expenditure running at £480, and there was no capital left. The Trustees tried to make economies, but in May 1922, with the current account <b>overdrawn,</b> they resolved to close the navigation from 3 June 1922.|$|E
2500|$|When {{trust assets}} are {{mixed up with}} {{property}} of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate, a solicitor sold £2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and {{put the money in}} his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of £3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary [...] "cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money". Again, in Re Oatway, a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When trust assets are mixed up with money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this [...] "first in, first out" [...] rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' managed fund portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a collective investment scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a [...] "rolling pari passu" [...] system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through subrogation, or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are [...] "swollen". In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan, however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose <b>overdrawn</b> accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an <b>overdrawn</b> account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is [...] "a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund." ...|$|E
