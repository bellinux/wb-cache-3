5|$|Dumbo, in {{production}} during {{the midst of}} the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941 and proved to be a financial success. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, less than a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of Pinocchio, and two-fifths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, Bambi was released, and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia, did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it only grossed $1.64 million.|$|E

5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of importing sterile IV fluids {{and the absence of}} a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

Double-file lines over a block long were reported for opening-week showings at the Audubon Theatre in New York.
