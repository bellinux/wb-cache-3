5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

Those loyal to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E

5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory.

5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 68, amidst growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide, and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman EmpireGalba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasiansuccessively vied for the imperial power. News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor. Before reaching Italy however, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt, and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
