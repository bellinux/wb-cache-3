40|$|In {{many areas}} of signal, system, and control theory, <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions</b> play an {{important}} role in issues of analysis and design. In this paper, we will expand and generalize the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions</b> as basis functions for dynamical system representations. The <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions</b> can be considered as generalizations of, for example, the pulse functions, Laguerre functions, and Kautz functions. A least-squares identification method is studied that estimates a finite number of expansion coefficients in the series expansion of a transfer function, where the expansion is in terms of recently introduced generalized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions.</b> The analysis is based on the result that the corresponding linear regression normal equations have a block Toeplitz structure.

50|$|In {{statistics}} and signal processing, {{the method of}} empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> (EOF) analysis is a decomposition of a signal or data set in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data. It is similar to performing a principal components analysis on the data, except that the EOF method finds both time series and spatial patterns.

5000|$|The {{principal}} component analysis/empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> analysis (PCA/EOF) {{has been widely}} used in data analysis and image compression,its main objective is to reduce a data set containing {{a large number of}} variables to a data set containing fewer variables, but that still represents a large fraction of the variability contained in the original data set. In climate studies, EOF analysis is often used to study possible spatial modes (i.e., patterns) of variability and how they change with time [...] In statistics, EOF analysis is known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).|$|E
5000|$|The {{latitude}} of {{the north}} wall was read from each chart {{at each of the}} six longitudes: 79, 75, 72, 70, 67 and 65°W. Principal components analysis was then used to find the pattern of variation common to the six longitudes. This is preferable to simple averaging of the six latitude estimates which would emphasise the eastern longitudes where the north-south movements are largest, and possibly obscure smaller but coherent north-south shifts further west. Correlation coefficients are calculated between the six time-series and the principal components are the eigenvectors of the resulting correlation matrix. (Empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> analysis proceeds instead from the variance-covariance matrix which again is biased to the eastern longitudes.) ...|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Taylor and Stephens2 {{constructed}} {{a measure of}} the latitude of the current, the Gulf Stream south wall (GSNW) index by extracting and analysing time-series of the latitude at six longitudes between 79°W and 65°W, a series of data that continues to the present day. There have been other subsequent studies. In 1994, Drinkwater et al. examined the latitude of the north wall from the 1970s to 1992 at each degree of longitude from 50 to 75°W, and Miller analysed the onshore/offshore position of the north wall at 10 cross-isobath transects equally spaced between 75 and 80°W from 1976 to 1988. Gangopadhyay et al. have derived a ten-year time series of the latitude of the separation of the Gulf Stream from the 1970s to the 1980s. By applying empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> analysis to temperatures at 200 metres, Joyce et al. in 2001 {{constructed a}} similar index to the GSNW index extending back to the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|In mathematics, {{a saddle}} point or minimax {{point is a}} point {{on the surface of}} the graph of a {{function}} where the slopes (derivatives) of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> components defining the surface become zero (a stationary point) but are not a local extremum on both axes. [...] The saddle point will always occur at a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis. The name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that curves up in one direction, and curves down in a different direction, resembling a riding saddle or a mountain pass between two peaks forming a landform saddle. In terms of contour lines, a saddle point in two dimensions gives rise to a contour graph or trace that appears to intersect itself - such conceptually might form a 'figure eight' around both peaks; assuming the contour graph is at the very 'specific altitude' of the saddle point in three dimensions.|$|E

MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) is considered as a quantitative indicator for examining dynamic vegetation changes. This paper applied a new method of integrated empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> (EOF) and temporal unmixing analysis (TUA) to detect the vegetation decreasing cover in Jiangsu Province of China. The empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> (EOF) statistical results provide vegetation decreasing/increasing trend as prior information for temporal unmixing analysis. Temporal unmixing analysis (TUA) results could reveal the dominant spatial distribution of decreasing vegetation. The results showed that decreasing vegetation areas in Jiangsu are distributed in the suburbs and newly constructed areas. For validation, the vegetation’s decreasing cover is revealed by linear spectral mixture from Landsat data in three selected cities. Vegetation decreasing areas pixels are also calculated from land use maps in 2000 and 2010. The accuracy of integrated empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> and temporal unmixing analysis method is about 83. 14 %. This method can be applied to detect vegetation change in large rapidly urbanizing areas...|$|E
