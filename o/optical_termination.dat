40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of differentiation within {{the nervous system}} including proliferation and differentiation, migration cell growth and development of axonal and dendritic synaptic connections. Are fundamental processes that generate a remarkably complex neuronal and, to a large extent, still poorly understood. As drafted by the neurotrophic theory, another important process involved in determining the morphology and physiology of neural "programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis, which acts both on different types of neuronal and glial cells (Kuan et al., 2000; Roth and D'Sa, 2001; Davies, 2003, Buss et al, 2006). Although recently this early stage of cell death {{is the subject of}} numerous studies, the cell populations involved, the regulatory mechanisms involved, its scale and its functional implications are still far from being characterized as appropriate. The retina is an easily accessible part of the central nervous system and therefore has become a classic model for studies of neural development and apoptosis (Cepko et al., 1996, Harris 1997, Marquardt and Gruss, 2002; Adler, 2005). In fact, the visual system, while preserving the intense proliferative activity ontogenetic, passes through a number of significant apoptosis (Cook et al 1998; Biehlmaier et al., 2001; Candal et al., 2005; Alunni et al., 2007). The development of the olfactory system in vertebrate species studied morphogenetic level requires an intense proliferative activity, as witnessed by strong business PCNAsica (Ino et al., 2000) which tends to decline proceeding with development. Likewise, the olfactory mucosa presents events of apoptosis, but as a pattern appears to differ from those that occur in the eye (Ohsawa 1 et al., 2008). Of course for each group of vertebrates on this basic scheme, is part of the variants characteristics that determine a unique pattern of development. The data concerning the differentiation of embryonic olfactory and visual system of vertebrates are uncommon and those conducted as in Bufo bufo and X. laevis, do not provide data on the numbers of cells in apoptosis and mitosis (Mathis et al., 1988; Straznicky and Nguyen, 1989; Stiemke and Hollyfield, 1995). The counts of apoptotic cells and mitotic figures are estimates of the degree of remodeling of the organ. Then from these estimates can be inferred, first functional correlations of the other, comparing the data with those in letteraura, including the evolving nature of information. For this reason, in this work were studied in detail the various stages of development of some vertebrates (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Xenopus laevis, Rana esculenta, Bufo bufo, Coturnix coturnix) in order to broaden knowledge on the morphogenesis of the eye and smell and try to get a picture on the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the events of proliferation and remodeling of these organs by comparing related species also from the point of evolution, but have a different ecology (for example, animals such as Xenopus laevis, Rana esculenta and Bufo bufo, which all belong to the same order of amphibians, but have a different degree of hydrophilicity). For this purpose, were stained with hematoxylin sections of these organs during their differentiation to detect and count apoptotic and mitotic figures as indicators of proliferative activity and rearrangement of the structures. Also, has also been used for PCNA immunohistochemistry to consolidate the data on observations of cells in active proliferation, and to confirm the apoptotic peaks observed through the reading of histological sections was evaluated nuclear protein level of PARP fragmentation. The most innovative aspect of this research is the attempt to correlate a system during development undergoes a profound and continuous rearrangement, as in the visual system, a system with a bit less dynamic as the olfactory organ. The comparison of results obtained in this study with those produced by other authors is {{complicated by the fact that}} the ontogeny of different vertebrates, as such, follows patterns that are fairly typical of the group. In Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum eye development starts very early, starting 2 days after fertilization, the eye in this stage of development consists of a cluster of cells in proliferation, where the lens is separated from the start of the retina formation of the vitreous humor. The exponential growth of the eye throughout its development. The retina has this trend to a standstill on the seventh day after fertilization, by which time the animal has almost completed its anatomical development. The number of mitoses found in the retina of the animal is always high with the occurrence of a strong proliferative activity especially during the early development stages of fish, at 4 days 3 days after fertilization. In addition, during the development of retinal Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum two explosions occur apoptotic at 2 days and 5 days after fertilization (as demonstrated by the total counts of apoptosis made and confirmed by the presence of two apoptotic indices in these days of development). The presence of the first explosion apoptosis may be explained by the need to eliminate excess cells that were formed during the earliest phases of development of the eye of the fish (in fact, these days also occur strong proliferative phenomena) Approximately 5 days after fertilization, the eye of Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum is the stratification of the retina, and this event is likely to induce a second wave of apoptosis in the tumor with the plexiform layers of cells in excess are induced programmed cell death. In Xenopus laevis has been studied the development of both sensory systems. Xenopus laevis eye development starts from the stage 29; at this stage the eye is booming, with the presence of a strong proliferative activity and a crystal clear just sketched. Throughout the development of the eye grows exponentially. Analyzing the graphs of retinal growth and the number of cells observed, there was a growth of the retina from the stage 29 to stage 59 and then later in a slight decrease. In parallel there was an increase in the number of total cells during development except for two drops that occur after stage 42 and stage 63, a stage next to the metamorphosis. This decrease can be attributed to its peak apoptotic stage 42. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation of cell density, which decreases in the retina following the events of cell death. Instead, the eye of Bufo bufo follows the pattern of differentiation typical of other vertebrates, of course, with a timetable that is characteristic of the species. The early stages of development studies covered newly hatched embryos: looking at the growth chart is also comparable to the increase in the number of cells counted in sections, it is observed that the retina does not undergo a substantial increase of the size of the stage between 10 and 13. Starting from the stage 15, however, the eye grows gradually considering that at this stage begins the secretion of the vitreous humor. In parallel, there is also increasing the number of cells in the retina was also confirmed by the intense mitotic activity occurred between stage 13 and 15. Thus, this figure contrasts with the literature which shows the increase in size more important in the early stages of development. However, proceeding in the development, the retina resumes its normal growth until the stagnation observed at the stage of metamorphic climax. Regarding the proliferative activity of the retina, the neuronal elements of the eye, after an initial phase where it is produced throughout the retina, are located in a concentrated area directly facing the lens, MCZ. This phenomenon in the toad is also confirmed by the expression of PCNA, which follows the same pattern of mitosis, although it is expressed in a greater number of nuclei. In addition, during the development process of programmed cell death and cell differentiation coexist in the retina. In the common toad is an increase in the number of apoptotic stage 21 which then tends to decrease, followed by a second peak at stage 28, the figure is confirmed by both histological and biochemical analysis. The differentiation of the retina of the toad does not proceed synchronously, but follows a gradient that goes from the lens opposite (proximal region of the retina) to the region move closer to the lens, ciliary marginal zone (MCZ). The area of the retina grows progressively until stage 31, which represents the metamorphic climax. Highly significant increases are recorded at the stadium just 28 and 31. A similar trend can be observed for the number of total cells that make up the retina, but they, having achieved a significant increase in stage 28, growth arrest. This is not surprising, since growth of the retina is also related to the counterpart of fiber, of course, continue to increase until stage 31. As expected, the strong mitotic activity in the early stages of development and suffers a decrease up to the stage 21 and then increased to 28, after which suffers a terminal decline after metamorphosis in which mitotic figures become more sporadic. The minimum mitotic stage 21 does not correspond to a slowdown in growth in the number of cells, but the significant increase in the number of cells observed at the stage 28, is concordant with the second increase in mitotic index. The development of apoptosis in two waves does not leave visible signs on the growth of the retina, even if this first wave coincides with a minimum mitotic apoptosis, as evidenced also based on the graph of PARP- 1 fragmentation. The second wave of apoptosis, however, shall determine, in conjunction with the fall of mitotic activity, a drastic decrease in cells of the retina. In Coturnix coturnix in the early stages of eye development studies covered an embryo after 4 days of incubation, where you look at the outline of the eye and the whole body is in full training. The eye of Coturnix coturnix has experienced rapid growth followed by a downturn towards the latter stages of development of the animal, close to hatching. The retina of Coturnix coturnix grows in size during development, with a standstill on the seventeenth day of incubation. The number of total cells in the retina observed in development has increased in numbers until the eleventh day of incubation and then decreased on days 12, 14 and 16 days after incubation, but not significant. However, these decreases are not entirely correlated with apoptotic events, because only the reduction of cells at the stage 12 is due to an apoptotic peak. The first event of programmed cell death in Coturnix coturnix occurs at the beginning of his retinal development in an embryo after 4 days of incubation and an 'other apoptotic event occurs after 11 days of incubation. The development of the olfactory system was studied in two amphibians: Xenopus laevis, Rana esculenta. To summarize briefly the most important events are found to contain an undifferentiated olfactory placode to the stage 38. The next stage sees the start of dell'invaginazione placode. During stage 42 is medially the vomeronasal organ primordium. Finally, stage 50 begins to form the side room. The later stages can only see the progressive morphological differentiation of these three rooms and the opening of the choanae, which coincides with the metamorphosis. At the beginning of differentiation of the peripheral olfactory system in all the nuclei are intense proliferative activity. Then after this activity tends to localize progressively in the basal level in the rooms smell and fall. Later in development the expression of PCNA remains more or less the same amount in the sensory part of the three rooms. What we see is that the olfactory organs appear more complex and all the sensory areas have an PCNAsica very fine, but mainly localized in basal regions of the mucosa. This obviously means that their development goes hand in hand. Even the non-sensory areas that constitute the respiratory epithelium of the rooms have many olfactory cells PCNA-ir. During metamorphosis, while the epithelium and the vomeronasal organ side of the room are substantially similar to themselves, the epithelium of the main chamber is undergoing a profound change (Hansen et al., 1998). This is reflected in the fact that this will become a hollow "air nose" in metamorphosis, where the role of "water nose" will be hired by the chamber of training later, lying side (Altner, 1952; Weiss, 1986). Regarding the study on the development of olfactory mucosa of Rana esculenta, it was observed that the stage 20, the olfactory placode is still undifferentiated and only then begins a process of differentiation through a process of invagination that starts in the stadium 23. At stage 25, the gills are covered with skin and communicate with the outside through the opening and an oral specific trap. They will be active at least until the climax metamorphic. At this stage, a first draft it identifies olfactory mucosa seems directed toward the differentiation of sensory elements, as they are already these lashes, although very short. The activity PCNAasica intense in all subdivisions of the olfactory mucosa places obviously in favor of an intense proliferative activity. The primordium of the vomeronasal appears around stage 27. In the green frog, the vomeronasal organ is clearly visible as a diverticulum which originates from the regions interior side of the mucosa. Its formation is characterized by its strong proliferative activity at the level of intussusception. In the remaining parts of the olfactory, the activity keeps ir a pattern similar to that previously analyzed. The vomeronasal pushing medially continues to increase, as evidenced by the increased proliferative activity media. Meanwhile, also appear in the structures that will be differentiated microvilli. Even the respiratory epithelium increases progressively increasing the epithelial surface affected the exchange of oxygen. Evident, in fact, the formation of a diverticulum located dorsal to the vomeronasal compared with the presence of activity. The olfactory organ takes on characteristics similar to those found in the adult stage 30, when they appear glands of Bowman. This is supported by the analysis of proliferative activity associated with them. The presence of Bowman's glands is a very important indicator that announces the start of the functionality of the aerial olfactory mucosa. The fact that it is very early in the frog may be due to a simple time difference between the two species, or the fact that the tadpole of the frog begins to use the olfactory system in ambient air before the metamorphosis. Structurally, the remaining course of development, the olfactory organ does not undergo any significant change. Ir activity is still very fine, even after metamorphosis: the olfactory system, although functional, yet increases in parallel to increasing animal body. In conclusion of this work can be said that during the development of vertebrates, all organs are subjected to the phenomenon of programmed cell death and cell differentiation coexist. The duration of both processes was analyzed in different species of vertebrates and has been observed at different times and in different regions of structures like the retina (etal Valenciano., 2009). The reason for the phenomenon of apoptosis remains an enigma. It 'been postulated that cell death occurs due to lack of sufficient targets brain areas that receive the optical fibers. In practice, if the number of retinal afferent fibers that reach is higher than the number of available sites in the roof of the <b>optical</b> <b>termination,</b> fiber "supernumerary" degenerate (Rager and Rager, 1978). One could speculate that the transition from aquatic life to the air would require extensive reworking of the visual structures, but the idea was immediately contradicted by studies on fish products, which also undergo apoptosis. What is quite certain is that during development the eye produces a strong surplus of cells, which must be eliminated. In the frog (and other amphibians studied) the second wave of apoptosis occurs when the individual is still at the stage of tadpole stage where the eye is already working. E 'possible then, that in the tadpole's vision has not yet been perfected and that it refers primarily olfactory sensory system as the main reference. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the olfactory system does not undergo massive apoptosis during development. Summing up the comparative data is noted that all vertebrates have a restructuring early apoptotic eye and ends in reptiles and birds during embryogenesis. This could be caused by the need to have a visual organ already differentiated and fully functional at birth. In fish and amphibians, but the apoptotic phenomenon stops just before the metamorphosis, which still corresponds to the event of birth or hatching of the amniotes, as demonstrated by the study of the levels of the hormone thyroxine (Stubbe et al., 1978; Tata, 1993; Wassenaer and Kok, 2004). It is well known that these vertebrates and especially birds and fish use the view as the main body and is therefore natural that this body is fully functional even after the birth. Amphibians and fish larvae are already using the eye long before the metamorphosis, but the phenomena of rearrangement affected during this period it is clear that the functionality is not full, but as previously mentioned can apply to other sensory systems (eg system olfactory). In contrast to mammals at birth and they see little or no use to a large extent the smell in the monitoring of environmental signals that surround them (smells of parents, food), what might be true for larval fish and amphibians. This hypothesis is further reflected in the studies on the olfactory system of Xenopus laevis and Rana esculenta, where there is a olfactory mucosa during development of the tadpole is not subject to obvious apoptosis and cell rearrangement, then proves to be a very static compared apoptotic and proliferative events which occur in the eye of vertebrates studied show that the presence of a much more dynamic system embryologically as the eye...|$|E

All upstream transmissions converge by means of the passive splitters/combiners to just one OLT unit which serves all by time sharing. The ability to reach such a high splitting ratio became possible by the development of bursty mode optical amplifiers (OA's). In addition, OA's make possible a 100 -km-long feeder which can bypass the local exchange into the first core switch, bringing further savings to both initial and running costs. These techniques allow SuperPON's to lower the access cost per customer, holding for the promise of ushering into domestic local loops the photonics revolution which has already transformed the transmission plant. These savings, however, can only be realized under the assumption that the system can accept high loading before exceeding the limits of quality of service (QoS) requirements and without distorting the egress traffic in a way that jeopardizes the statistical estimates on which ATM connection acceptance was based.

A new concept for the optical network unit bandwidth reporting procedure is developed instead of the conventional reporting of current queue status. The development of a balance transferring enables a bandwidth register and transfer mechanism in which the reported but bandwidth-unassigned requirements from previous allocations can be tracked and manipulated at the <b>optical</b> line <b>termination.</b> Dynamic bandwidth compensation is achieved through the balance transferring mechanism. The combination of the new reporting procedure and the balance transferring mechanism is incorporated into a prioritised resource allocation to accommodate differentiated services.

40|$|For {{the future}} {{development}} of residential broadband telecommunication services the present access infrastructure must be upgraded. Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) optical networks, though still expensive today, {{appear to be}} a future-proof solution. FTTH networks based on passive optical Remote Nodes (RN) and supporting ATM switching (ATM-PONs) have been demonstrated and are going to be standardized. In these networks the optical hardware in the RN is very simple, but a multiple access protocol is needed for upstream traffic control. In most protocols proposed in literature the control is performed electronically in a centralized wayby the Central Office (CO). In this paper we study multiple access schemes for FTTH networks which perform upstream traffic control in a distributed way with the intervention of the user <b>Optical</b> Network <b>Terminations</b> (ONTs) and of the RN only. We will also consider the case, based on recent research in photonic packet switching, in which the RN is able to perform alloptical ATM-multiplexing. We will employ ONT-RN signalling to make the relatively expensive RN optical buffer co-operate with the electronic buffers located in the ONTs. The different solutions presented will be compared by simulating the network behavior under various traffic conditions. In conclusion, in this work we evaluate performance advantages achievable in FTTH networks by increasing the optical complexity of the RN and by introducing control schemes which allow a distributed upstream traffic management and, {{in the case of an}} RN able to perform all-optical ATM-multiplexing, the co-operation of the RN buffer with the ONT buffers...|$|R

The octoxy capped particles were stable under an ambient atmosphere for at least one month, but exposure to water made them prone to oxidation.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding competition and industry structure {{in the context of}} Fiber to the Home (FTTH). We present engineering cost models, which indicate that FTTH is a decreasing cost industry, thereby making facilities based competition an unlikely outcome. Non-facilities based competition (or service level competition) in FTTH can happen in data-link layer (or transport) services via unbundled dark fiber (i. e. unbundled network elements) and in higher layer (voice, video and data) services via logical layer unbundling (or open access). FTTH architectures differ in {{the extent to which they}} support unbundling and therefore the extent of non-facilities based competition in FTTH depends on the architecture of the shared network over which multiple service providers offer service. Among the four different FTTH architectures considered, the curbside single-wavelength Passive Optical Network architecture (PON) (that has isolated pole-mounted splitters) has the most economical fiber plant but permits unbundling only at the logical layer. Physical plant unbundling is made possible in PONs by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple splitters (and hence multiple distribution fibers or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). OFAP architectures further lead to higher utilization of splitter and <b>Optical</b> Line <b>Termination</b> (OLT) ports in markets that have less than 100 % penetration, lowers NPV Capital Costs and provides the service provider with a real option to (i) defer investment in OLT ports (ii) deploy multiple data-link layer technologies and (iii) effectively phase in new technologies- under both monopoly and competition...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors present the latest {{results of the}} MUSE project with respect to highbandwidth optical access. The project {{partners}} represented by the authors have developed three different optical access solutions during the project period. First, a hierarchical coarse wavelength division multiplex (CWDM) based ring network, which not only provides high-bandwidth FttX connectivity, but also acts as integrating feeder network for other First Mile Access technologies like those described thereafter. The system, comprising a 10 km feeder area ring (FAR) carrying CWDM signals and a bandwidth-sharing distribution area ring (DAR) is able to provide protected connectivity to about 1800 end-users. Second, an analogue very high bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) over optics system, which transmits VDSL signals over an optical carrier by means of sub-carrier multiplexing. Transmission of DSL signals over optical fibre is a potential method for extending the range of high bandwidth DSL signals, such as VDSL, far beyond that possible in copper. The VDSL over optics (VDSLoO) system is capable of carrying multiple channels between <b>Optical</b> Line <b>Termination</b> (OLT) and <b>Optical</b> network Unit (ONU). Third, a system concept for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), {{which is based on}} a Radio over Fibre (RoF) system using the Optical Frequency Multiplication (OFM) method. The system is bi-directional and supports a wide range of radio frequencies (RF) over optical links due to the dispersion-tolerant OFM technique. With OFM, extremely pure microwave carriers can be realised, allowing comprehensive modulation schemes. All three systems have been tested and characterized using a common set-up, where the CWDM FAR acts as transport platform for three different distribution systems running on separate wavelengths. A block diagram of the lab set-up and the important results of this specific trial are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} application of MPLS multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a Passive Optical Network (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). PON technology {{may be used in}} mobile backhaul networks to support the end segments closest to the aggregation devices. In these cases, there may be {{a very large number of}} pseudowire (PW) Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes. The MPLS control plane could be used to provision these end segments, but support for the necessary protocols would complicate the management of the T-PEs and would significantly increase their expense. Alternatively, static, or management plane, configuration could be used to configure the end segments, but the very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy burden on the network manager. This document describes how to set up the end segment of an end-toend MPLS PW over a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (G-PON) or 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) using the G-PON and XG-PON management protocol, <b>Optical</b> Network <b>Termination</b> Management and Control Interface (OMCI). This simplifies and speeds up PW provisioning compared with manual configuration. This document also shows how an MS-PW may be constructed from an end segment supported over a PON, and switched to one or more segments supported over an MPLS PSN. Li, et al.

50|$|The passive {{optical network}} (PON) uses tree-like network {{topology}}. Due to the topology of PON, the transmission modes for downstream (that is, from <b>optical</b> line <b>termination,</b> (OLT) to <b>optical</b> network unit (ONU)) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal to all the ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. One given ONU can find which frame in the CM stream is for it by reading the header of the frame. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. It is because that all the signals transmitted from the ONUs converge (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlap among themselves if CM is used. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot {{and it needs to}} transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. In order to compensate the phase variation from packet to packet, burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) is required. Such circuit can generate local clock with the frequency and phase same as the individual received optical packet in a short locking time, for example within 40 ns. Such generated local clock can in turn perform correct data decision. Above all, the clock and data recovery can be performed correctly after a short locking time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the timing advantage of implementing a multiple-fan-beam projection technique using optical fiber sensors for a tomography system. To prepare the sensors {{to be used}} for this projection, a collimator is not needed, but <b>optical</b> fiber lens <b>termination</b> is crucial. In this research, the fiber optic lens for transmitters is modeled by experimental methods to transmit light at an emission angle of 30 deg. Due to this small emission angle, a multiprojection technique can be implemented without the light overlapping. A multiple-fan-beam projection technique is here defined as one allowing more than one emitter to project light at the same time using the switch-mode fan-beam method. This method can increase the optical sensor's ability for flow visualization. For the 32 pairs of sensors used, the two-projection technique and four-projection technique were investigated. Sixteen sets of projections formed one frame of light emission for the two-projection technique, and eight sets did so for the four-projection technique. Compared to the conventional single-light projection used in the switch-mode fan-beam method, multiple-light projection can achieve a higher data acquisition rate, thus minimizing data loss and producing a more accurate real-time tomographic image. For four projections the data acquisition rate is 609. 76 frames/s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to compare and quantify the simulated effects of noise, index errors, and photometric level errors on four different <b>optical</b> monitoring layer <b>termination</b> strategies. A computer program to simulate optical thin film monitoring has been written for this work. These four termination methods are: photometric cut level, two types of turning point termination, and percent change from the extrema of the last maximum and minimum in the optical monitoring curve (POEM). The turning point termination algorithms which have been implemented are described briefly. A 4 -layer antireflection coating design has been simulated to find its possibilities and limitations, and to quantify the effects. The level cut strategy works well if the noise is low and the errors in index and photometric scale are small; however, systematic errors are a problem for level cuts {{in the presence of}} index and/or photometric scale errors. All of the other strategies are insensitive to index and/or photometric scale errors. It was found that two the turning point strategies work reasonably well from the turning point to points beyond that. The POEM strategy is robust and insensitive to errors when it is used beyond a ~ 5 % difference from the photometric level of the turning point...|$|R
40|$|The Broadband {{photonics}} (BBP) project {{under the}} Freeband consortium of projects investigated {{the design of}} a dynamically reconfigurable photonic access network. Access networks form a key link in ensuring optimal bandwidth to the end user without which any improvements deeper in the network in the aggregation or core segments are mitigated. Optical fiber deployment in the access are a natural choice as the bandwidth de- mands increase and Passive Optical Networks (PONs) form a preferred way of im- plementing fiber deployments. PONs have a logical Point to Multi-Point (P 2 MP) topology where in the downstream, the <b>Optical</b> Line <b>Termination</b> (OLT) broad- casts to all Optical Network Units (ONUs) while in the upstream, it is a many-to- one transmission and is contention based. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) ac- cess is one way of arbitration and in this thesis a qualitative analysis and comparison of the leading TDM based PON standards- EPON and GPON is presented. In traditional PONs, the average bandwidth available per user depends on the num- ber of ONUs supported by a single OLT. Typically the OLT-ONU association is fixed. The BBP network concept extends the view of a fiber plant deployment to a stack of logical PONs where multiple wavelength pairs are used to support a number of "logical" PONs. In this network, a headend based OLT transmits the down- stream data by modulating a C-Band, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) laser. In addition it transmits the light of a Continuous Wave (CW) DWDM laser, also in the C-Band, which is modulated with data by a Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (RSOA) in an ONU and used for upstream communication. The ONUs are thus wavelength agnostic. The OLT-ONU association is thus dynamic and depends on the wavelength pair added/dropped towards the ONU. The bandwidth availability to an end user can be optimised on an inter-PON basis. The research work focuses on the techniques to realise the bandwidth optimisation using Linear Programming techniques and de- scribes the service delivery architecture that can be realised to ensure an optical ser- vice delivery to the end user using conventional protocols of operation. The perspec- tive views of the network from a data to control plane operation are also presented...|$|R

Consequently, though a PON supports ‘open access’ based competition in higher layer services like voice, data and switched digital video, it does not facilitate competition in data-link layer services or in the provision of analog broadcast video services. In complete contrast, the Home Run architecture has the highest initial (fiber related) capital cost, but permits unbundling of both the physical plant and at the logical layer. The Home Run architecture therefore supports a per subscriber choice of data-link layer services (via UNE based competition) as well as competition in higher layer voice, video and data services (via open access). This work further identifies deployment strategies, which can facilitate physical plant unbundling at costs much lower than the Home Run architecture. Physical plant unbundling is made possible by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple distribution fibers (or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). Ideally, both passive splitters and active electronics can be deployed at an OFAP.

40|$|THESE are {{interesting}} times {{for all of}} us. In recent years, our ecological awareness has dramatically increased due to better understanding, education, awarenessraising and perceivable changes in both nature and climate. Even in our daily lives major transformations are hard to ignore: energy saving lamps, electric cars, windmills, solar panels –to name just a few–, along with increasing energy bills. The Internet, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) by extension, which has managed to penetrate nearly {{every aspect of our}} modern society in mere decades, is undeniably essential in the quest for means to reduce our ecological footprint and striving towards a sustainable future because of its unique capabilities to instantly and globally unite massive amounts of data, calculation power and specialized manpower. Thus, allowing to cope with increasingly challenging scientific and technological issues and to use scarce resources sparingly, whether by optimizing existing production processes, trading physical encounters for virtual alternatives or migrating from an economy based on the manufacturing of goods to one based on trading in knowledge and services. Though ICT clearly has the potential to evolve towards a sustainable society, a darker side becomes apparent. After decades of explosive expansion, the global ICT infrastructure has grown to consume a considerable share of the worldwide available energy. Though estimations vary considerably and are mostly based on –more or less conservative– extrapolations, alternatingly including office and consumer electronics, care is urgently required to avoid ICT from completely overshadowing its enabling effect. Among others, access networks and data centers are notorious for their power consumption. The introduction chapter of this dissertation reflects on the necessity of uninterrupted efforts and research to further increase the performance of the ICT infrastructure; on issues related to the rising energy consumption and on the considerable share access networks usurps. Besides, an overview of early attempts and initiatives to turn the tide is presented. The remainder of this work consists of two main components. The first component, described in chapter 2 aims to augment the functionality and performance of the present network technology. This work was a contribution to the IWT Vampire project, which suggested an access network topology in which a considerable part of the video processing which now takes place on the subscribers’ equipment –e. g. for digital TV and video conferencing– would be shifted to and centralized on specialized high-end hardware {{on the edge of the}} access network. This so-called “thinbox” concept, requiring mere basic and static hardware at the subscribers’ premises, at first would allow for more flexibility and smoother upgrades. In the opposing –“thickbox”–approach, new services all too often require upgrades of the end-user hardware, a statistical fraction of which ends in costly failures. The thin-box approach, additionally, could allow for a whole range of new, tailored services benefiting from the location in the network and reducing the data traffic to the end-user. The main objective of IWT Vampire was to define a novel hardware architecture for the delivery of enhanced video based services, and a number of technological building blocks (both software and hardware), necessary to enable these services in large scale deployments. The compressed nature of video streams, however, is an important obstruction to perform elaborate video processing. Consequently, research in the IWT Vampire project has focused on simultaneous and real-time H. 264 encoding of multiple (10 - 1000) video streams. More specifically, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based building blocks for a high-throughput H. 264 encoding architecture were researched. Focusing on intra-prediction, residual transformation and reconstruction, a throughput of over 13 million macroblocks (blocks of 256 pixels) per second can be achieved. This easily allows to simultaneously process 32 HD video streams at 30 fps. This was achieved by realizing a massively parallel and deeply pipelined architecture in which bubbles were mostly avoided by exploiting the availability of other video streams. This architecture is elaborately discussed in chapter 2. The second component of this work deals with a novel network communication protocol that could drastically reduce the energy consumption in the access network. This protocol, coined Bit-Interleaving PON (BiPON), is motivated and explained in detail in chapter 3. Its Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation, coined BiCDR, is elaborately discussed in chapter 4. This new protocol specifically aims to reduce the energy consumption in the subscribers’ equipment. Because of their numbers, this equipment is responsible for a considerable fraction of global ICT power consumption. Passive Optical Network (PON), the physical layer for the new BiPON and the well-known B/(X) G/(G) E-PON, is a promising, passive, low-power optical access network technology which has seen massive deployment over the past few years. Its tree-shaped, shared nature requires some kind of multiplexing for the <b>Optical</b> Line <b>Termination</b> (OLT) to address Optical Network Units (ONUs) individually, despite broadcasting its message. To this day, only Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) -based approaches have been standardized and deployed, namely B/(X) G/(G) E-PON, which are packet-switched to cope with the typically bursty IP-traffic in the access network. In short, the problem with the current packet-switched TDM protocols is that each subscriber performs considerable amounts of processing on the downstream broadcast data at aggregated line rate, before selecting the useful data targeted for that specific ONU. Assuming 10 Gbit=s downstream, to be shared over 128 users which could roughly be assigned 100 Mbit=s each on average, data is processed at 10 Gbit=s while keeping a mere 1 %. Clearly, this is a costly approach in terms of energy and reveals considerable room for improvement in terms of energy efficiency. Solutions relying on sleep-mode techniques have been suggested, yet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and non-negligible sleep/wake transition times limit their efficacy. BiPON takes a radically different approach. A single frame contains data for all users, be it in a highly regular structure, while still offering high flexibility to scale and distribute bandwidth resources. The ONU can immediately subsample the incoming data, depending on the actual, dynamically adjustable, ONU-bitrate, virtually eliminating processing at the aggregated line rate. In chapter 3, a comparison between FPGAimplementations of both BiPON and XG-PON reveal an energy saving potential of a factor between 35 and 180, depending on the actual bandwidth allocated to a particular ONU. Chapter 4 presents the ASIC implementation of this protocol along with a Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) system and a decimator, which overcomes the well-known power inefficiency of the aforementioned FPGA-implementations. Chapter 5 finally presents the ongoing project DISCUS, part of the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7), which suggests radical changes in the entire network relying on state of the art optical network technology. Part of this project aims to take the Bit-Interleaving CDR/decimator (BiCDR) to the next level, namely 40 Gbit=s. Initial work is presented along with prospects for the future...|$|R
