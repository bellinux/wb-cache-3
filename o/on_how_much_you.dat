But while wiping out nearly every character on the show would have been a memorably bleak way to end things, Grimm seeks to imbue the finale with emotional weight by applying the tried and true formula of the importance of family. Whether or not that undercuts what was building up to be a remarkably violent and somber end will likely depend <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> mileage <b>you</b> get from the idea of ghosts returning to help the living in their time of need.

In December a member, Mrs. Cantwell, held a meeting at her home, where members could bring a friend or guest to participate or observe. Many of the visitors ended up joining the association. Early in 1916 the ICWSA petitioned the Home Office for the return of a female factory inspector to Ireland. The inspector was the only female inspector in Ireland and had been moved to England. The ICWSA claimed that they wanted her to return in order to “safeguard the rights of Irish factory girls”. Their petition was unsuccessful. That year they also printed two pamphlets called “The Irish Citizen” and “An American Priest on Votes for Women” which they handed out at polling booths during the election in Dublin. These pamphlets discussed why Irish women Should be able to vote.|$|R
5000|$|Airbrush makeup is {{characterized}} by its unique 'globular' [...] application technique. The makeup is dispersed as an extremely fine mist through the airbrush gun. Millions of tiny little dots are created on the skin and when connected and layered together, create somewhat of a net over the entire face. This makes airbrush makeup to be a thin, light layer on the skin that is barely noticeable to the wearer. Certain formulas wear better than others {{and it is important}} to choose carefully when deciding what mixture is right for the job. Some airbrush makeups are entirely waterproof unless taken off with a specific remover that breaks down the active ingredient. For instance, silicone-based airbrush fluid is largely waterproof depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> set the makeup. It can be dunked in water (handy for fashion photography or film) or sweat through without removing or dislodging the airbrush base. It does however, take a specific silicone makeup remover to thoroughly take off (but will naturally come off over the course of many hours). In the contemporary makeup scene, airbrush makeup has become a preferred option for bridal and events makeup due to its long wearing and flawless appearance.|$|R

50|$|First things first, {{you should}} {{eliminate}} huge sources of trans fats, unnatural sugars, and processed foods. However, {{the amount you}} cut down on depends <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> previously consumed daily and how unnatural those foods were.

Avoid artificial flavors and colors, as some are made from insects or could cause cancer. How many ingredients are listed for the product? Chances are the more you read, the less healthy it will be. Our bodies are meant to consume certain foods, and if the ingredients list runs long, you should find an alternative food item that either has simpler and fewer ingredients, or try to make the item on your own.

5000|$|There {{are three}} meters {{governing}} each fighter, health, stamina and adrenaline. The health meter is depleted with every punch landed but {{staying away from}} further punishment will slowly replenish it during the round. While you regain some health in between rounds, the bar gets shorter as the rounds progress, depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> damage <b>you</b> take. The health meter also affects your overall speed, along with the stamina bar. The stamina meter gets drained much faster than those seen in other boxing titles. Throwing a single flurry of punches could be enough to empty the stamina bar, at which point your fighter will be extremely slow and vulnerable, with his punches becoming significantly weaker. However, by resting for a few seconds, the stamina bar quickly refills. The system eliminates 'button mashing' and encourages players to pick their shots and box in a realistic manner. In addition, doing dash moves repeatedly will deplete the stamina bar. The adrenaline meter gives players access to powerful signature punches. The meter {{is divided into three}} sections, with each section representing one signature punch. Holding the left bumper with any punch button results in different signature punches. When the meter is full, the player has the choice to go into [...] "adrenaline mode" [...] by pressing the left and right bumpers simultaneously. While in this mode, the color palette of the screen changes and the player's stats are maxed out for approximately 10 seconds and can punch faster and harder with no speed or stamina penalties. By landing your own combos and defending against your opponent's, you fill the adrenaline bar. Landing step-in and step-around punches fill the meter a little quicker. Most players will be able to fill at least the first section of the adrenaline bar within a full round, but filling the entire meter could take 2 or more rounds.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} emphasis {{on the need for}} New Zealanders to make personal provision for their retirement, and not rely on New Zealand Superannuationi. Successive governments have taken steps to encourage this, including the establishment of the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income (formerly the Retirement Commission) in 1993 and the introduction of the KiwiSaver scheme in 2007. A key question that needs to be answered by someone seeking to make provision for their retirement is simply <b>How</b> <b>much</b> will I need in retirement? There are some guidelines to assist in answering this question. For example, in the section on retirement planning, the Sorted websiteii suggests that key elements of that calculation are: • the length of time a person expects to be retired, which depends upon the age at which they retire and their expected longevity • the type of retirement lifestyle a person wants to have • whether a person will live in their own home A rule of thumb that has developed is that a person needs 70 - 80 % of their pre-retirement income after retiring, but that takes no account of the person’s pre-retirement expenditure. Every person’s situation is different, and therefore there is no defi nitive {{answer to the question of}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> an individual needs for his or her retirement. The answer will be different for each person. What a person needs to do is draw up a proposed budget, based on his or her expected expenditure patterns. However, even that is not straightforward because if you are not currently retired, how do you know what items you will need to spend money <b>on</b> and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> will need to spend. There is often a perception that older people have higher health costs, while another common perception is that older people do a lot of travelling because of their lack of work commitments. How accurate are these perceptions, and what does it mean for retirement expenditure? These guidelines will help address these questions, by providing information about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> current retirees spend and on what items. An individual can then use that information to feed into his or her own draft retirement budget, and therefore be in a better position to answer the question of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> s/he will need for his or her retirement.

5000|$|The {{predictive}} {{validity of}} the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a [...]63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of [...]76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms. With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of [...]53 and [...]62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of [...]66 and [...]68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions. All these studies have reflected the strong correlation exists between people’s attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations are not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people’s life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the behavior, if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people’s perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to commit certain behaviors. Research has also pointed out that {{people are more likely to}} perform the behavior if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the behavior appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and enjoy your time can greatly determine your attitude towards drinking after work. Second factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention of drinking after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitude towards drinking and whether the society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically <b>how</b> <b>much</b> confidence <b>you</b> have <b>on</b> controlling <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>you</b> will drink. If all of these factors leading towards a direction to enhance your intention to have some drink after work, you are more likely to perform such a behavior. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and higher consistency your original intention will become.
