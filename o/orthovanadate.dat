We have compared the optical properties of <b>orthovanadates</b> with periodates, and also with its high pressure phase. The main difference observed in moving from <b>orthovanadates</b> to periodates is the increase in band gap, and bands turn out to be less dispersive. By considering all these facts, we predict <b>orthovanadates</b> to be better scintillators than periodates, which is well explained from the band structure, and optical properties calculations. In addition, we also compared the optical properties of <b>orthovanadates</b> at ambient, and high pressure and we observed a decrease in the band gap of <b>orthovanadates,</b> increase in valence band width at high pressure when compared to ambient phase. Tuning the band gap, which is an important criteria for scintillators, can be observed in <b>orthovanadates</b> by decreasing the cation size, and also by moving to the high pressure scheelite phase.

500|$|When the europium-doped yttrium <b>orthovanadate</b> red {{phosphor}} {{was discovered}} in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause {{a revolution in the}} color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result.

These phase transitions are confirmed by specific heat measurements. The phase transition at T-t in LaVO 3 or T- 0 in CeVO 3 {{is due to a}} G- type orbital ordering which lowers the structure symmetry from orthorhombic Pbnm to monoclinic P 2 (1) /b 11. The structure change at T-N in CeVO 3 is ascribed to an orbital ordering enhanced magnetostrictive distortion, while that at T-N in LaVO 3 is most probably due to an ordered occupation of the vanadium 3 d t(2 g) orbitals associated with an antiferromagnetic ordering. We propose that the first order phase transition at T-t in LaVO 3 should be associated with a sudden change of both spin and orbital configurations, similar to the phase transition at T- s= 77 K in YVO 3 [Ren et al., Nature (London) 396, 441 (1998) ], causing a reversal of the net magnetization. However, the ordered state above T-t in LaVO 3 is identical to that below T-s in YVO 3.
