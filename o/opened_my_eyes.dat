500|$|Initially {{reluctant}} to try LSD, McCartney eventually {{did so in}} late 1966, and took his second [...] "acid trip" [...] in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, [...] "It <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes...</b> made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society." [...] He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, {{along with the other}} Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Lupo the Butcher was a {{successful}} short and has earned itself a cult following. Eric Fogel, co-creator of Glenn Martin, DDS, stated that Lupo the Butcher inspired him {{to pursue a career}} in animation, saying: [...] "That film <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired me to pursue a career path that was a bit more…twisted." [...] In an interview with Take One, Linda Simensky called the short [...] "the South Park of its time" [...] and stated that she remembers tapes containing the short being passed around her office in 1988. It was featured in Spike and Mike's book Outlaw Animation, written by Jerry Beck, and in the Spike and Mike DVD.|$|E
500|$|Salinger's {{writing has}} {{influenced}} several prominent writers, prompting Harold Brodkey (himself an O.

[...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> as to how you can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material."

500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> the room was spinning." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, {{starting}} {{horses in}} 53 races for the year, she also {{took over the}} training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working {{as part of the}} management at Gulfstream Park. [...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to get up in the morning is amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s, Parks and {{her husband}} were members of the Voters' League. Sometime soon after 1944, she held a brief job at Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its {{location}} in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property. She rode on its integrated trolley. Speaking to her biographer, Parks noted, [...] "You might just say Maxwell <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> up." [...] Parks worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for Clifford and Virginia Durr, a white couple. Politically liberal, the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged—and eventually helped sponsor—Parks in the summer of 1955 to attend the Highlander Folk School, an education center for activism in workers' rights and racial equality in Monteagle, Tennessee. There Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer Septima Clark. In 1945, despite the Jim Crow laws and discrimination by registrars, she succeeded in registering to vote on her third try.|$|E

In his late-teens, Parker discovered the many '60s and '70s psychedelic rock artists that would have a huge influence on his music, saying that [...] "I got into bands like Cream and Jefferson Airplane in a big way, and loved the sound of their recordings. My friends were listening to bands like Brainticket and Demon Fuzz who <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to different ways of constructing songs.

And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were.
