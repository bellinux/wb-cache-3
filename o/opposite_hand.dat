25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> to place each breast gently into the cup (the scoop), and she then runs her index finger along the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, in two handed bowling, {{two fingers}} are {{inserted}} into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel-style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate their hips {{more than a single}} handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 700 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.|$|E
25|$|A left-arm {{orthodox}} spinner who bats {{with the}} <b>opposite</b> <b>hand,</b> Mylavarapu {{was part of}} a Singaporean team that placed sixth at the ACC Under-15 Cup in mid-2006. Despite being only 16, he was included in the Singaporean under-19 team for the 2007 ACC Under-19 Elite Cup the following year, and played four matches, with a best of 2/30 against the United Arab Emirates. He remained eligible for the team at the 2009 edition of the same tournament, but took only three wickets from five matches. Mylavarapu was selected in Singapore's 15-man squad for the 2011 Stan Nagaiah Trophy against Malaysia, but did not play any of the matches. He did, however, play in the Carl Schubert Trophy (the under-23 equivalent) in 2013, and was consequently selected as a standby player for Singapore at the 2013 ACC Emerging Teams Cup.|$|E

25|$|Born in Stellenbosch, Smith {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in January 1991, against Border during the 1990–91 {{season of the}} Castle Bowl (the second division of the Currie Cup). A right-arm fast bowler who batted with the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand,</b> in his first match he took 2/26 and 4/59, which included the wicket of South African international Peter Kirsten in both innings. Despite his debut performance, Smith featured only irregularly for Boland over the following years, although he did play the entire 1993–94 season for the Boland second XI (known as Boland B). That team had gained first-class status for a single season only, following the senior Boland team's promotion to the main division. Smith's only five-wicket haul, 5/80 from 31.3 overs, came against Griqualand West in the first match of the 1993–94 season. His final match at first-class level came in March 1994, when Boland played the touring Australians. Smith finished his career with 22 wickets from 11 matches, and made exactly {{the same number of}} runs, which came at a batting average of only 2.44.|$|E
25|$|Pioneers and notable {{practitioners}} of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In {{the early days}} of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan, reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan, who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. Bowlers tend to disguise the direction of reverse swing by running up starting with the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> before switching hands and covering the ball {{for as long as possible}} before release. Neil Wagner utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.|$|E
25|$|Clubs: Multi-piece {{clubs are}} the most popular clubs. The club is built along an {{internal}} rod, providing a base on which a handle made of polyolefin plastic is wrapped, providing an airspace between it and the internal rod. This airspace provides flex, cushioning impact, making the club softer on the hands. Foam ends and knobs further cushion the club. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from 19 to 21 inches (480 to 530mm). The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative plastics and tapes. The skills involved are apparatus mastery and body elements, Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first. However, double and triple spins are frequently performed, allowing the club to be thrown higher for more advanced patterns and to allow tricks such as 360s to be performed underneath.|$|E

La Frantz, a left-handed batsman who bowled leg spin with the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand,</b> came in third in both innings of his first-class debut, behind openers Geoff Cook and Rex Rogers. He was bowled by Bill O'Reilly for six in the first innings, and made seven in the second innings before being dismissed in the same fashion by Ray Lindwall, who was also making his first-class debut. He was Lindwall's first, first class wicket. However La Frantz feared more Eddie Gilbert who La Frantz claimed was the fastest bowler of the generation.|$|E

2500|$|A no-thumb {{delivery}} involves inserting {{only two}} {{fingers into the}} bowling ball, leaving the thumb {{on the outside of}} the ball, in an effort to create more revolutions and greater hook. Due to similar ball roll and revolutions to the cranker style, it is sometimes considered a variation of cranking. As the bowler does not use the <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> to support the ball, the wrist is often severely cupped and/or the ball is balanced on the forearm and delivered using a bent elbow throughout the shot. [...] Another variation of this delivery is to palm the ball forcing the thumb to the side of the ball while forcing the elbow to lock so as to keep the arm straight and generate a back-swing. [...] This variation leads to far greater consistency and straightens the ball out when needed.

[...] Until February 24, 2015, Fredette held the all-time Section 2 high school record, until he was surpassed by Lake George senior Joel Wincowski. Fredette was named first-team all-state by the New York State Sportswriters Association and the Times Union as a junior and senior. He had several memorable on-court moments in his career at Glens Falls, including 12 different 40-point performances in his senior season, and a shot against Voorheesville High School's Andrew Catellier in the season opener of his junior year in which he banked a three-pointer off the glass and in with his <b>opposite</b> <b>hand</b> to force overtime {{at the end of}} regulation. In his senior season Fredette led his team to a 25–2 record and the Class A State Championship game which they lost, 58–48, to a Peekskill High School team led by future Syracuse University forward Mookie Jones. He played AAU for the Albany City Rocks alongside future Penn State University point guard Talor Battle and Mark Domaracki.

50|$|Left-handed players {{sometimes}} {{choose an}} opposite-handed (mirror) instrument, although some {{play in a}} standard-handed manner, others play a standard-handed guitar reversed, and still others (for example Jimi Hendrix) play a standard-handed guitar strung in reverse. This last configuration differs from a true <b>opposite</b> <b>handed</b> guitar in that the saddle is normally angled {{in such a way}} that the bass strings are slightly longer than the treble strings to improve intonation. Reversing the strings therefore reverses the relative orientation of the saddle (negatively affecting intonation), although in Hendrix's case, this is believed to have been an important element in his unique sound.|$|R

If England or France had acted on this narrow principle, where would have been their Shakspeares, their Sheridans, their Beaumonts and Fletchers, and their Molieres!
