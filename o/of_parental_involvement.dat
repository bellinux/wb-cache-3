She also criticized its [...] "abrupt" [...] postwar ending. James Marten also found the section rushed in The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society. Jane Turner Censer pointed to Brenda Stevenson's connection between slaves' brutal treatment and their force used on children as missing from the volume. As for its originality, she also said the book held [...] "few surprises for historians of slavery". Joshua D. Rothman noted {{the same in the}} Journal of the Early Republic. Franklin, writing for History of Education Quarterly, preferred the sections on the unique realities facing these children, such as their relation to puberty and courting, and was not as interested in comparisons between slave children and adults. He bemoaned the original release's organization for only occasionally discussing these practices, and suggested organization by social practices instead of by activity to reduce redundancy. [...] Censer and Marten also complained of this repetition. In The New York Times, Douglas A. Sylva thought the book suffered from weak style and structure, with good research lost in vague topic sentences and conclusions. Franklin additionally noted insufficient citation of relevant secondary literature and recommended a harsher edit, while Loren Schweninger upheld the book's citation quality and accounted for all [...] "important secondary source" [...] on slavery in the back matter.|$|E

Villa, Anh-Luu Huynh-Hohnbaum, Dale WeaverAttention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderADHD {{is among}} the most common mental health {{disorders}} in children. Children with mental health issues have a greater difficulty with school performance and developing positive relationships. The present study examines the relationship between socio economic status (SES), ethnicity, usual source <b>of</b> care, <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD in children. The data utilized in this study was obtained from the California Health Interview Survey, (CHIS) 2007 Children's survey. The independent variables for this study were SES, ethnicity, usual source <b>of</b> care and <b>parental</b> <b>involvement.</b> SES was measured by educational attainment <b>of</b> parent. <b>Parental</b> <b>involvement</b> was measured based on number of days parent read to child or exposed child to music or singing. The dependent variable is the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. Frequency and regression analyses were performed in order {{to examine the relationship between}} variables. The regression analyses found that the greatest predictors of ADD/ADHD were poverty and ethnicity...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{factors that can}} explain the {{achievement}} gap. Among {{some of the most}} studied and popular theories are that predominantly Black/Latino schools are concentrated in low SES neighborhoods that do not receive adequate resources to invest in their student’s education (such as the ability to pay for qualified teachers) and that parental influence in Black and Latino families lags behind White families in terms of involvement in school. Family influence is significant as is seen by a study that demonstrated how high levels <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> in low income communities can actually assist in mitigating the achievement gap.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold: (1) to examine the {{relationship}} between immigrant <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and selected variables which the literature indicates may affect immigrant <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> in the education of their children, and (2) how their involvement relates to student achievement. 486 immigrant parents from six schools, 2 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, and 2 high schools, were participants in the study. The questionnaires were translated into English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Somali, Chinese and Bosnian. A quantitative research design was utilized to conduct the study. Descriptive statistics were done for demographic information in terms of independent and moderator variables. The independent and dependent variables were analyzed with Pearson Correlation and ANOV A statistical tools. The independent variables were immigration status, cultural background, primary language, length of time in U. S., aspirations for their children, and familiarity with American school culture. The dependent variables were <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and student achievement. Moderator variables were age, gender, level of education, cultural background, school type and SES in country of origin. The findings indicated that the relationships between the independent and dependent variables were not significant at the. 05 level, however when the relationships were analyzed in terms of moderator variables significant differences emerged for educational level throughout the study. There was a significant difference in the relationship between <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and immigration status in terms <b>of</b> educational level; <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and cultural background in terms <b>of</b> educational level; <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and primary language spoken in terms of educational and school type; <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and length <b>of</b> time in United States in terms <b>of</b> educational level; <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and parent’ aspirations for their children in terms <b>of</b> educational level; <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and familiarity in American School Culture in terms of educational level, cultural background, school type, age, gender, and SES in country of origin.

40|$|Summary:This review {{explores the}} {{international}} literature on therapeutic work with sexually abused children. The {{emphasis is on}} the nature, extent and outcomes <b>of</b> non-offending <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> in such work. The context is an increasing recognition of the significant influence that non-offending parents may have on their children’s recovery and, at the same time, the serious impact on parents themselves of finding out about the sexual abuse of their children, including the impact on their relationships with their children. Findings:The article identifies a number of distinct approaches to therapy that differ widely in the nature and extent <b>of</b> non-offending <b>parental</b> <b>involvement.</b> The diversity <b>of</b> approach reflects the variety of underlying theoretical orientation. The implications for children’s recovery are discussed. Applications: Involving non-offending parents in therapeutic work with their sexually abused children may be important in promoting successful outcomes. It is argued that the perceived benefits of some of the approaches under review may be used flexibly, and in combination, to make significant advances in practice. ...|$|R

50|$|Displacement {{from parents}} {{includes}} {{events such as}} abandonment of the adolescent, divorce, or death of a parent. Parental relationships are a representation of belonging for adolescents because parents may be particularly important for providing the stable and caring relationships that are a fundamental component of belonging. Relationships between parents and adolescents that are positive {{have been found to}} be a protective factor that reduces the risk of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Connectedness with parents such as closeness between parent and child and the perceived caring of parents, has been associated with lower levels of past suicide attempts and ideation. Another protective factor found against adolescent suicide attempts was higher levels <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> <b>involvement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{bond between}} {{siblings}} and other kin is largely {{dependent upon the}} age of the kin, and the level of involvement with the child. Older siblings can take on more of a parental role with younger siblings thus creating more of a parental bond. This parental bond is found when a parent dies, or when the level <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> is low, however this area of research is still fairly new. Siblings that are close in age often have more of a friendship bond. Siblings can also have a different type of bond that is not seen in other relationships because siblings have a close bond but may have more indecisive feelings towards each other.|$|E
30|$|On average, the {{correlation}} between parental literacy and numeracy involvement is relatively high across education systems (ρ = 0.66; see Table  2).

50|$|Another study {{emphasized}} the importance of home-based parental involvement. Altschul (2011) conducted a study that tested the effects of six different types <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and their effect on Mexican American students. The study used previous data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988. The data was used to evaluate the influence of parental practices in the 8th grade and their effect on students once they were in the 10th grade. Altschul (2011) noted that home-based parental involvement had a more positive effect on the academic achievement of Mexican American students, than involvement in school organizations. The literature suggests that parental involvement in the school setting is not necessary, parents can impact the academic achievement of their children from their home.|$|E
50|$|Low-income {{families}} {{are less likely}} to provide a stimulating home learning environment to their children due to time constraints and financial stress. Compared to two-parent households, children with a single-parent generally don't have better social, behavioral, educational, or cognitive outcomes than those with two parents because of economic vulnerability and a lack <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> <b>involvement.</b> A child's academic achievement is influenced by parents' educational attainment, parenting style, and parental investment in their child's cognitive and educational success. Upper-income {{families are}} able to afford learning opportunities inside and outside of the classroom. Poverty-stricken children are subjected to fewer stimulating recreational activities, often missing out on trips to libraries or museums, and are unable to access a tutor to help with problematic academic areas.|$|E
