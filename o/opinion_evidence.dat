The Austrian concept of an active judge, however, goes along with the judge’s duty to do case-management and especially to induce a truthful fact-finding using judicial discretion. While only five means of proof (documents, witnesses, expert <b>opinions,</b> <b>evidence</b> by inspection and the examination of parties) are explicitly listed the Austrian civil procedure code, there is no numerus clausus regarding the means of evidence.

50|$|Generally, {{witnesses}} {{are not permitted}} when giving evidence to tender their own opinions as fact. The {{reason for this is}} that to allow <b>opinion</b> <b>evidence</b> would be to usurp the fact finding duties of either a jury - in criminal trials - or of the Judge. Thus, a witness is allowed to testify that he saw a suspect waiting on a street corner at a specified time, but not that he believed the suspect 'looked shady', or was 'up to no good'. Such evidence would not only be irrelevant as having little probative value, but could be damaging if accepted by the tribunal as fact.|$|E

[...] In such sexual misconduct cases, a defendant may offer [...] "evidence of specific instances of a victim’s sexual behavior" [...] only to show that someone other than the defendant was the source of [...] "semen, injury, or other physical evidence," [...] or to show that the victim had consented to sexual behavior with the defendant.|$|E
5000|$|Applying that {{standard}} {{to the evidence}} proffered by the Carmichaels tire expert, the Court concluded that the district court correctly refused to admit the experts testimony. The district court had {{to determine whether the}} tire experts methods could reliably determine what had caused the tire on the Carmichaels van to explode. The experts experience as a tire engineer wasnt the problem - the expert had worked for ten years at Michelin. The fact that visual inspection of tires was generally a reliable method wasnt an issue either, because the issue before the court was specific to the tire on the Carmichaels van. But the expert said that his inspection of the tire led to the conclusion that a defect caused the tire to explode because he did not see evidence of other causes. [...] "Nothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit <b>opinion</b> <b>evidence</b> that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert only by the statement of the expert himself." [...] The district court acted within its discretion to exclude the evidence proffered by the tire expert in light of these concerns.

On one hand, the Rehnquist Court, which had previously not been a reliable friend of criminal defendants, in 2002, ruled that it was unconstitutional to execute mentally retarded defendants, and in 2005 it came to the same conclusion as to defendants who committed a capital crime before his or her eighteenth birthday. On the other hand, close scrutiny of these <b>opinions</b> <b>evidences</b> that the Court all but casts aside methodology to reach the apparently desired outcome. The Court’s rulings that neither juveniles nor mentally retarded defendants could be executed were welcome pronouncements to death penalty abolitionists—that is, those who advocate for and work toward the legal prohibition of capital punishment.
