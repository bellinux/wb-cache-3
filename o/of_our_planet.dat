25|$|Technoliberalism is a {{political}} philosophy founded on ideas of liberty, individuality, responsibility, decentralization, and self-awareness. It also highlights an idea that technology {{should be available to}} everyone without controls. Its core beliefs fit under five main interests that include Construction of the Government, Economics, Civil Liberties, Education and Science, and Environment. Technoliberals support such ideas as balance of powers in the government, decentralization, affordable education, the protection <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet,</b> Fine Arts, and the freedom of speech and communication technologies.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet,</b> that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
25|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, marine life helps determine {{the very nature}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b> Marine life resources provide food (especially food fish), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and {{are involved in the}} regulation of the Earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.|$|E

25|$|This is {{so because}} the energy {{released}} in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, {{is proportional to}} the area of the fault that ruptures and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes. The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000nbsp&km. Examples are the earthquakes in Chile, 1960; Alaska, 1957; Sumatra, 2004, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939) and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.|$|E

It contains a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to the planet, extracts from the Canopean reference, History of Shikasta, and copies of letters and journals written by selected Shikastans. The history of Shikasta is monitored by the virtually immortal Canopeans, from Rohanda's prehistory, through to Shikasta's [...] "Century of Destruction" [...] (Earth's 20th century), and into Earth's future when the Chinese occupy Europe and World War III breaks out.

2500|$|From a {{standpoint}} of environmental scepticism, Booker seeks to combine {{an analysis of}} the science of global warming with the consequences of political decisions to reduce [...] emissions and claims that, as governments prepare to make radical changes in energy policies, the scientific evidence for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged. He asserts that global warming is not supported by a significant number of climate scientists, and criticises how the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents evidence and data, in particular citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate global climate models to make temperature projections. Booker concludes, [...] "it begins to look very possible that the nightmare vision <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> being doomed" [...] may be imaginary, and that, if so, [...] "it {{will turn out to be}} one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made".|$|E
2500|$|This {{inaugural address}} {{influenced}} the geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips. In their 1822 book on Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales Conybeare {{referred to the}} same features in an introduction {{about the relationship between}} geology and religion, describing how a deluge causing [...] "the last great geological change to which the surface <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> appears to have been exposed" [...] left behind the debris (which he named in Latin Diluvium) as evidence for [...] "that great and universal catastrophe to which it seems most properly assignable". In 1823 Buckland published his detailed account of [...] "Relics of the Flood", Reliquiae Diluvianae; or, Observations on the Organic Remains Contained in Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel and on Other Geological Phenomena Attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge, incorporating his research suggesting that animal fossils had been dragged into the Kirkdale Cave by hyenas then covered by a layer of red mud washed in by the Deluge.|$|E
2500|$|This {{alliance}} between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions. While Bush was in São Paulo {{as part of the}} 2007 Latin American tour, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, from Buenos Aires, dismissed the ethanol plan as [...] "a crazy thing" [...] and accused the U.S. of trying [...] "to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life." [...] Chavez' complaints were quickly followed by then Cuban President Fidel Castro, who wrote that [...] "you will see how many people among the hungry masses <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> will no longer consume corn." [...] "Or even worse," [...] he continued, [...] "by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change."' Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazil technical aid, said that [...] "we reject the gibberish of those who applaud Bush's totally absurd proposal, which attacks the food security rights of Latin Americans and Africans, who are major corn consumers", however, he voiced support for sugar cane based ethanol during Lula's visit to Nicaragua.|$|E
