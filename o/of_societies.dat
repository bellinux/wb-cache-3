5|$|The Age of Discovery {{beginning}} in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, {{as well as by}} the transformation <b>of</b> <b>societies</b> through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines. Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelised in India, China, and Japan.|$|E

Theoretical clearing up of the problem is complicated by unsettled state of concept-category apparatus, namely identifying of concepts of ethnic structure and ethnic composition <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> interpretation the nation as an ethnic phenomenon and so on. The ethnic structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> is one <b>of</b> types (substructures) of its social structure. Consequently, the reasonable solution <b>of</b> <b>society</b> ethnic structuring ques tions is to be carried out on methodological principles of social structuring in general. The author uses as a basis Anthony Giddensâ determination which assumes the social structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> as a gnosiological construct. However, the author underlines, that this structure is not merely a product of consciousness, but is the phenomenon based on relations communications between elements of empirically fixed ontological reality, that is the social structure <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> Therefore determination <b>of</b> the social structure notion must represent its pluralistic essence and the distinction between social struc ture and composition <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> On these principles, the analysis of ethnic structure <b>of</b> <b>society</b> should be deepened up to the level of its substructures, including ethnic structure. Particularly, one can select its mere components brought into correlation with tasks of political nation building...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt {{from the}} full-text article: The family {{is both a}} source <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and a product <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> As a source <b>of</b> <b>society</b> the family {{produces}} individuals, values {{and a set of}} behaviors we call socialization which helps to build institutions which constitute the fabric <b>of</b> the larger <b>society.</b> As a product <b>of</b> <b>society</b> the family is highly influenced, conditioned and to a great extent determined by the forces which emanate from the institutional fabric <b>of</b> the larger <b>society.</b> Thus, what a family is, is to some extent determined by, influenced by, defined by the larger context <b>of</b> the <b>society</b> in which families function. Thus, the family is not an independent unit <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and it is not primarily a causative factor in society. It is, as sociologists term it, highly interdependent with the other aspects <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> In Black Families in White America, we have described this conception as a social systems approach to the study of childhood and family life. It calls attention to the total network of social reality within which families are structured and within which they function...|$|R
