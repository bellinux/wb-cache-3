5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their <b>own</b> <b>debt,</b> and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

25|$|Public benefit {{corporations}} in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are {{a form of}} government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their <b>own</b> <b>debt,</b> allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting {{so much of the}} credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version contains hints of Romantic themes when it mourns {{the death of}} Chatterton. Coleridge was influenced by John Milton's Lycidas, Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and the poetry of both William Bowles and Thomas Warton. Gray's particular influence was in word choice and Coleridge's incorporating the image of Chatterton as a young poet. Warton's The Suicide provides a connection to Chatterton by describing a poor poet killing himself. Although Warton {{made it clear that}} he was not thinking of Chatterton when composing the poem, Coleridge believed that there was a connection, and he believed that Warton's depiction was too unfavourable towards Chatterton. Coleridge was personally affected by the idea of Chatterton's death and how the poet was ruined by debt. Of the later point, Coleridge knew of poverty affecting many poets that he admired along with having a lot of experience with his <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> and poverty.|$|E

25|$|An {{administrator}} (sometimes {{known as}} the administratrix, if female) acts as the personal representative of the deceased in relation to land and other property in the UK. Consequently, when the estate under administration consists wholly or mainly of land, the court will grant administration to {{the heir to the}} exclusion of the next of kin. In the absence of any heir or next of kin, the Crown has the right to property (other than land) as bona vacantia, and to the land by virtue of the historic land rights of the Crown (and the Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Lancaster in their respective areas). If a creditor claims and obtains a Grant of Administration, the court compels him or her to enter into a bond with two sureties that he or she will not prefer his or her <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to those of other creditors.|$|E
500|$|Bosse {{made two}} films, ambitiously shot and {{directed}} {{and based on}} novels by well-known writers. The artistic achievement of Sons of Ingmar (1919) has been highly praised. Directed by and co-starring Victor Sjöström, {{it was based on}} a novel by Swedish Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf; many years later, Ingmar Bergman referred to Sons of Ingmar as a [...] "magnificent, remarkable film" [...] and acknowledged his <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to Sjöström. Bosse, who played the female lead Brita, called Sons of Ingmar [...] "the only worthwhile Swedish film I was involved in." [...] However, the film failed to give her career the kind of fresh start that the Swedish film industry had given Edvin Adolphson, and it was seventeen years before she made another film. This was Bombi Bitt and I (1936), her only talkie, based on Fritiof Nilsson Piraten's popular first novel with the same title and directed by Gösta Rodin. Bombi Bitt was a successful, though more lightweight, production with a smaller Bosse role ("Franskan").|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and {{felt as if they}} [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that meant something, out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E

2500|$|Such a {{sustained}} attack, equated by comparatist Nicolae Balotă with [...] "a holocaust of poetry", nevertheless impressed Lovinescu. The latter declared himself {{in agreement with}} the thesis that ancient models were perishable, and that traditionalist art was implicitly false. Seen by Alexandru Paleologu as a more radical anti-classicist than Zarifopol ever was, Lovinescu noted in 1943: [...] "as modernism or synchronism, I have been supporting those same ideas these past twenty years." [...] Zarifopol's revolt was more contextual, and bound by his <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to the classics: Ralea sees him as a classical rationalist in the manner of Voltaire, Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole France, and Călinescu as a [...] "cultured academic, for all his freethinking airs", copying his style from Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi, without [...] "a sense of the sublime". Balotă also finds Zarifopol a [...] "suppressed scholar", [...] "in denial of his formative background".|$|E

2500|$|The {{activity}} at Contimporanul cemented Janco's belief in primitivism {{and the values}} of outsider art. In a 1924 piece, he argued: [...] "The art of children, folk art, the art of psychopaths, of primitive people are the liveliest ones, the most expressive ones, coming to us from organic depths, without cultivated beauty." [...] He ridiculed, like Ion Vinea before him, the substance of Romania's academic traditionalism, notably in a provocative drawing which showed a grazing donkey under the title [...] "Tradition". Instead, Janco was publicizing the idea that Dada and various other strands of modernism were the actual tradition, for being indirectly indebted to the absurdist nature of Romanian folklore. The matter of Janco's <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to his country's peasant art is more controversial. In the 1920s, Vinea discussed Janco's Cubism is a direct echo of an old abstract art that is supposedly native and exclusive to Romania—an assumption considered exaggerated by Paul Cernat. Seiwert suggests that virtually none of Janco's paintings show a verifiable contact with Romanian primitivism, but his opinion is questioned by Sandqvist: he writes that Janco's masks and prints are homages to traditional Romanian decorative patterns.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Collingwood's {{excellent}} {{chapters on}} the art criticism of Ruskin would be better, in my opinion, if they showed more consciousness of the after revolutions that have reversed, at least in detail, much of Ruskin's teaching.

But if we return to that Raphaelism to which he was so unjust, let us not fall into the old error of intelligent reactionaries, that of ignoring our <b>own</b> <b>debt</b> to revolutions. Ruskin could not destroy the market of Raphaelism, but he could and did destroy its monopoly. We may go back to the Renaissance, but let us remember that we go back free.
