40|$|We present CCD {{photometry}} {{and proper}} motion {{studies of the}} three <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> NGC 4103, NGC 5281, and NGC 4755 (kappa Cru). By fitting isochrones to the colour magnitude diagrams, we found that all three objects are young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> with ages of at most t= 45 Myr. They are located at distances from approx. 1600 pc to 2200 pc, derived from distance moduli (m-M) _ 0 ranging from 11 mag to 12 mag. We combined membership determinations based on proper motions and statistical field star subtraction to derive the initial mass function (IMF) of the clusters. The shape of the IMFs could be represented by power laws with exponents of Gamma=- 1. 46 +/- 0. 22 for NGC 4103, Gamma=- 1. 60 +/- 0. 50 for NGC 5281, and Gamma=- 1. 68 +/- 0. 14 for NGC 4755, when - as a reference - Salpeter's (1955) value would be Gamma=- 1. 35.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} {{which indicates}} the luminosity functions of <b>star</b> forming regions, <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> and the field dips between spectral types M 7 -M 8.

40|$|Abstract. The {{discovery}} of Jupiter–like planets with high eccentricities {{raises the question}} of how these eccentricities are produced. We propose that eccentric giant planets (EGPs) could be formed in <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> as a result of purely dynamical processes. It is found that at least 3 % of the giant planets around <b>stars</b> in <b>open</b> <b>clusters</b> can develop high eccentricities due to multi-body gravitational interactions; this percentage increases to 20 % if considering only G-dwarf stars. The formation mechanism implies complex dynamical interactions inside retrograde hierarchical configurations within the cluster core. The percentage of planetary systems leaving <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> without changes in their original dynamical properties can be very large, almost 90 %.

40|$|Context. A {{sample of}} 14 young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> has been {{observed}} in the TeV energy regime with the stereoscopic system of the HEGRA (High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy) Cherenkov telescopes from 1997 to 2002, resulting in more than 300 h of observation time. Aims. Young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> {{may contribute to the}} acceleration of cosmic rays. The detection of γ-rays (from decaying π 0 s produced in hadronic interactions) from these objects could be evidence for such a contribution. The results of our observations are compared to available γ-ray data and to a simple hadronic model in the framework of shock front acceleration of cosmic rays in the stellar winds of the cluster members to test the potential of the presently available data on young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> to constrain this type of model. Methods. The stereoscopic system of HEGRA Cherenkov telescopes makes use of the atmospheric imaging technique. Air showers initiated by primary Gamma-Rays are recorded as elliptical images in the telescope cameras. The images from the different telescopes are then superimposed to reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle. This technique (stereoscopy) was pioneered by the HEGRA experiment. Results. No significant excess has been found in the analysed data set of young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters.</b> The derived upper limit on the TeV gamma-ray flux from Berkeley 87 and the available EGRET data from the same direction do not allow us to fully constrain the simple hadronic model used here. The comparison of the upper limits derived for all 14 objects with the flux detected from TeV J 2032 + 4130 (under the assumption of an association of the TeV-signal with the compact stellar association CygOB 2) suggests that γ-ray emission from young <b>open</b> <b>star</b> <b>clusters</b> as an object class cannot be ruled out.
