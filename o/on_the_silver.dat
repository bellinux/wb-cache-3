5|$|The battleground {{proved to}} be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to Bryan—and the Democrat spent much of his time in those crucial states. The Northeast was {{considered}} most likely safe for McKinley after the early-voting states of Maine and Vermont supported him in September. By then, it was clear that public support for silver had receded, and McKinley began to emphasize the tariff issue. By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the Electoral College. Bryan had concentrated entirely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> issue, and had not appealed to urban workers. Voters in cities supported McKinley; the only city outside the South of more than 100,000 population carried by Bryan was Denver, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Highbury {{has also}} hosted several cricket games and also {{baseball}} matches involving American servicemen between 1916 and 1919. It was the venue for the 1966 World Heavyweight boxing title bout between Henry Cooper and Muhammad Ali, which Ali won. It has featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> screen as well, having been {{the backdrop for}} at least two movies: The Arsenal Stadium Mystery, and Fever Pitch.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the novel}} draws from Fleming's {{personal}} experiences: {{the opening of the}} book, with Bond's arrival at New York's Idlewild Airport was inspired by Fleming's own journeys in 1941 and 1953, and the warehouse at which Leiter is attacked by a shark was based on a similar building Fleming and his wife had visited in St. Petersburg, Florida on their recent journey. He also used his experiences on his two journeys <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Silver</b> Meteor as background for the route taken by Bond and Solitaire.|$|E

5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic was down to ten men when Bobo Balde was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block and rounded McNamara make it 3–2 for Porto. Porto managed to hang on even after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that Porto had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> goal rule.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass 2 (a.k.a. Enemy From Space in the United States) is a 1957 {{black-and-white}} British {{science fiction}} horror film from Hammer Film Productions, produced by Anthony Hinds, directed by Val Guest, that stars Brian Donlevy, and co-stars John Longden, Sid James, Bryan Forbes, Vera Day, and William Franklyn. Quatermass 2 is {{a sequel to}} Hammer's earlier film The Quatermass Xperiment (1955). Like its predecessor, {{it is based on}} the BBC Television serial Quatermass II written by Nigel Kneale. Brian Donlevy reprises his role as the eponymous Professor Bernard Quatermass, making him the only actor to twice play the character <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> screen.|$|E

5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E
5|$|Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was {{the initial}} front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested {{election}} of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination {{due to his}} poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each {{of the other candidates}} had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>silver</b> question were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, {{but the rest of the}} delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time, the archiepiscopal coinage at Canterbury also changed: the new archbishop, Wulfred, was very eager to assert his ecclesiastical rights, {{even at the}} expense of the king, and instituted an archiepiscopal {{portrait}} coinage bearing no reference at all to Coenwulf.
