5|$|September 28, 2002— The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Isidore produce widespread light rainfall <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and moderate wind gusts. Some small trees are blown down, and minor power outages are reported.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's Austronesian {{speakers}} were formerly distributed <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island's rugged central {{mountain range}} and were concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains.

5|$|As {{part of a}} {{reorganization}} of government departments, the post-secondary education portfolio {{was removed from the}} Department of Education and became part of the new Department of Advanced Education and Skills. Along with post-secondary education the new department would be responsible for apprentices, advanced studies and take <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsibilities of the former Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment. The Department of Education would be responsible for K-12 education, early childhood learning and the province's libraries.|$|E

5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony reached <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western Malay archipelago, {{had become}} the centre of Islamization in the east. The Malaccan {{tradition}} was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity. Since this era, the Islamic faith became closely identified with Malay society and {{played a significant role}} in defining the Malay identity. The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems {{that occur in the}} middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Otto {{produced}} days of torrential rain <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northeastern Caribbean in October2010. Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering {{north of}} Puerto Rico on October6, and transitioned into {{a tropical storm}} the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale on October8, attaining peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible surroundings and became extratropical west of the Azores on October10. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to transition from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time of a period {{of at least one}} month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It {{is more common}} in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{central and eastern}} United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 {{by an act of}} Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E

50|$|According to {{numerous}} accounts, the production {{is alleged to}} have been a mostly disorganized affair, with the usually meticulous Tod Browning leaving cinematographer Karl Freund to take <b>over</b> during <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoot, making Freund something of an uncredited director on the film.|$|R
50|$|Damage was {{reported}} in extreme northern Illinois along the same line. Trees and power lines were knocked <b>over</b> in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northernmost areas, some landing on power lines and buildings. Extreme heat compounded the problem, forcing emergencies to be declared in several communities.|$|R
5|$|Ridership on the Mountaineer {{over its}} two-year {{probationary}} period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers {{per day in}} 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily ridership had dwindled to 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief respite, Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same route until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Since Bret {{remained}} {{over the}} open Atlantic {{for most of}} its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of Saint Vincent was a French {{invasion}} {{that took}} place between 16 and 18 June 1779 during the Anglo-French War. A French force commander named Charles Marie de Trolong du Rumain landed {{on the island of}} Saint Vincent in the West Indies and quickly took <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British-controlled part of the island, assisted by local Black Caribs who held {{the northern part of the}} island.|$|E

5|$|The Mountaineer was a {{passenger}} train operated by Amtrak between Norfolk, Virginia, and Chicago, Illinois, via Cincinnati, Ohio. It {{was the first}} train to use the Norfolk and Western Railway's tracks since the creation of Amtrak in 1971 and followed {{the route of the}} Pocahontas, the N's last passenger train. Service began in 1975 and ended in 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountaineers route but was itself discontinued in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The final {{process of}} the {{differentiation}} of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over {{the territory of the}} Kiev culture), the Penkovka culture and the Prague-Korchak culture, took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territories of the Chernyakhov culture and the Dacian Carpathian Tumuli culture. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Ulysses S. Grant began on March 4, 1869, {{when he was}} inaugurated as the 18th President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office {{in the aftermath of}} the Civil War, and he presided <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reconstruction Era. A Republican, Grant became president after defeating Democrat Horatio Seymour in the 1868 presidential election. He was reelected in 1872 in a landslide victory, overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the Liberal Republicans, which nominated Horace Greeley to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican Rutherford B. Hayes after the contested 1876 presidential election.|$|E
50|$|WPIQ {{first began}} {{broadcasting}} in 2004 under <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> 99.9 FM. In November 2007, the frequency {{was changed to}} 92.7 FM.

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{age of the universe}} is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E
5|$|Westhay Moor forms {{part of the}} Somerset Levels and Moors {{which is}} {{important}} for its grazing and ditch system, and is crossed by the River Brue and Galton's Canal. <b>Over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moor, the water table is high throughout the year with extensive winter flooding occurring regularly. The level of the water tables can be artificially lowered during active working of the peat excavations, but {{for much of the}} year these are often filled with water.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} {{had been}} added to the system that took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
5000|$|Pirates or buccaneers, some of {{whom were}} {{formerly}} privateers, took <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier privateers, especially during <b>the</b> Golden Age <b>of</b> Piracy (1660-1720). [...] Operating from bases within the Caribbean, such as Tortuga and later Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, pirates regularly raided Spanish possessions and shipping along <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Caribbean. They frequently stopped to re-supply at such places as Rio de la Hacha, Darien (which they also used as a base for raids on Panama or to cross to the Pacific) or the Miskito areas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountain}} parakeet has a {{very wide}} range and is fairly common in suitable habitat <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> that range. <b>The</b> IUCN has listed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|Although {{the lake}} itself {{is likely to}} be <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> a bushwalk, <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} high plains are also of interest. Mount Spion Kopje, about 3.7 km to the north east, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher nearby mountains, and has a great view from its dolerite capped summit <b>over</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Gippsland. <b>The</b> Wellington Plains offer expansive views, as does Mount Wellington.|$|R
