5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result <b>of</b> <b>Roswell</b> leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E

500|$|Roswell High School {{first opened}} in 1949, {{and is the}} second oldest high school in Fulton County north of the Chattahoochee River. Like the city <b>of</b> <b>Roswell,</b> the school bears the name <b>of</b> <b>Roswell</b> King. [...] King founded the cotton mill that would {{eventually}} be the city's economic backbone for much of its early history. The immediate predecessor to Roswell High School was the Roswell Public School on Mimosa Boulevard, which housed grades 1–10 and opened in the 1892 after the Georgia General Assembly passed Act No. 51 on December 20, 1892, allowing the city to elect a school board and levy taxes for support of the school. Students from outside the city limits were required to pay tuition. In 1896, the city council and mayor were authorized {{by the state to}} issue $5,000 in bonds to build a new school building.|$|E

50|$|State Telecasting {{decided to}} sell KSWS in 1983. The owners <b>of</b> <b>Roswell's</b> CBS affiliate, KBIM-TV, made the best bid for KCBD at $10.75 million, but due to KBIM itself, had to divest KSWS {{in order to keep}} KCBD. Otherwise, the {{ownership}} would break Federal Communications Commission rules because the same company would own two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>Roswell's</b> television media. The station was transferred to KCBD Associates which was headed by W. Robert McKinsey (the longtime general manager of KCBD and KSWS). A planned sale to the Hubbard interests at KOB-TV had to wait until the KSWS license was renewed. The license had been challenged.|$|R

500|$|The pilot, [...] "Broken Bow", was {{watched by}} 12.5 million viewers {{on the first}} {{broadcast}} on UPN. This was during the first full week of the new season on American television, and it was felt {{at the time that}} the combination of Enterprise, alongside Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Roswell would help to cross promote each other due to the science fiction and fantasy genre links. This even included a cross-over episode <b>of</b> <b>Roswell</b> with a character from that series auditioning before Jonathan Frakes for a role on Enterprise. After the first few weeks of episodes of Enterprise, the ratings were considered to be solid enough and the expectation was that the series would run for seven seasons in the same manner as The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. However, the viewing figures began to decrease towards the end of the season.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Foo Fighters" [...] {{was taken}} from the {{description}} World War II aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs. This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city <b>of</b> <b>Roswell,</b> New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol. Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive, given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence. [...] Goldsmith later explained, [...] "It was all pretty much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It's really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that." [...] Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.|$|E
