40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll</b> hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll</b> base plate. Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the oil passage area and oil groove configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil passage area, oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll</b> stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum oil groove design...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical method {{to calculate the}} bypass leakage mass flow rate along the tip seal in a scroll compressor. The leakage flows through small axial and radial clearances between the <b>orbiting</b> and fixed <b>scrolls</b> of scroll compressor were previously studied by Ishii et al. In these earlier studies, the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to leakage through the axial and radial clearances was measured using a maximum pressure of 3 MPa for CO 2 and 0. 6 MPa for R 22. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for incompressible, viscous fluid flow through the thin rectangular cross-section was applied to calculate the leakage mass flow rate that matched the pressure decay characteristics. The empirical friction factors were determined and plotted on a Moody diagram. As a result, the empirical friction factors for both axial and radial clearance leakage flows have been determined and shown to take on essentially the same value for both CO 2 and R 22, despite the significantly different working pressures. In contrast, the flow patterns in bypass leakage along the tip seal are so complicated that not even the leakage characteristics are known definitively. No method exists for calculating the bypass leakage mass flow rate. In the present study, a bypass leakage model was constructed, compatible with a production-type scroll compressor with a large cooling capacity. A similar test of the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to bypass leakages were conducted with the refrigerant gas R 410 A. The measured pressure decay characteristics were then simulated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the empirical friction factors from our previous study for the leakage flow through the axial clearance. In the present simulations of the measured pressure decay, the complicated flow patterns through bypass clearances were classified into two representative rectangular thin cross-section leakage passes, one with an equivalent width {{and the other with}} an equivalent length. Empirical friction factor values for the equivalent pass width and length were determined to match the measured pressure decays. As a result, the calculation of the bypass leakage flow rate along the tip seal in scroll compressors can be accomplished using a simple scheme in terms of the equivalent pass width and equivalent pass length for two representative leakage passes forming a thin rectangular cross-section and applying empirically determined friction factors,...|$|R
40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll.</b> One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll.</b> The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll</b> radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the tip seal in a tip seal groove, the sealing mechanism of the tip seal is clarified and a design guideline of the tip seal groove is obtained...|$|E

A strong {{demand for}} higher efficiency compressors {{that meet the}} stringent requirements of small size, light weight and quiet operation {{has resulted in the}} development of the scroll compressor. A scroll compressor’s pressure ratio is defined solely by the geometry of the scroll wraps. The equations for the involute profiles are established and the volume of the pockets are derived to illustrate the relationship between the various parameters. The relationships for the axial, radial, and tangential components of gas pressure forces, centrifugal force, bearing frictional forces, and contact forces are presented to quantify the system behavior. Optimization process has been employed as a tool to systematize the engineering design. The optimum design of the scroll compressor is formulated as a measure of performance parameters to be optimized while satisfying all the problem constraints. The system is mathematically defined in terms of the design variables, three objective functions (radius, mass of the <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll,</b> and average torque to drive the compressor) and constraint equations representing the relationships within the design problem.

40|$|Abstract. The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially scroll type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a fixed scroll and an <b>orbiting</b> <b>scroll</b> in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and refrigerant pressures. Two types of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|E
