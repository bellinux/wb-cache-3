The Scheme for Advanced Packet <b>Overflow</b> <b>Routing</b> (SAPOR) is a method that allows flow based routing, and can enable <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> in IP networks. This paper presents an analytical model to calculate overflow probabilities for flows with known flow rate distributions. It discusses implications of this model and compares the method to results found by simulation. The paper particularly targets blocking calculations in the highly loaded case, i. e. a non trivial part of the load is subject to overflow.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{years have}} seen major efforts to {{converge}} existing circuit switch telephony and Internet services into one network, governed by the Internet Protocol suite. The rapid traffic increase in this consolidated network is accommodated by optical networking technologies. Quality of Service in such carrier grade networks {{has become a major}} concern. Flow-based networking can help to address these challenging issues since flows are the natural smallest unit where behavioural requirements can be applied. This paper outlines flow-based networking and introduces a method for flow-based <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> in an optical MPLS/GMPLS network. I...|$|E

40|$|Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an {{open loop}} infrastructure, having {{independent}} movement of each node without any decentralized control. Due to dynamic nature. MANET has a many security issues than conventional networks. In this paper Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV) {{is used as a}} routing protocol in MANET. Many types of attack are introduced in MANET such as blackhole attack, wormhole attack,routing table <b>overflow</b> attack, <b>routing</b> cache poisoning attack etc.,which occur due to the malicious node and degrade the achievement of AODV. In this paper, blackhole attack is taken into consideration which is more dangerous than other attacks. To maintain a secure route selection under blackhole attack, it is necessary to make a strong security proposal, which maintain the performance of network. This paper introduces a new security scheme which deals with MAODV (Modified Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector) which enlarges the performance of network and eliminates the risk of blackhole attack in the presence of malicious node...|$|R
30|$|The {{support of}} {{multiple}} sinks, as described, implies {{that there will}} no longer be only one physical node on top of the DODAG. Each physical sink will be responsible for the communication to and from the nodes in its subtree. This has the disadvantage that a sink {{will not be able to}} communicate directly with each node inside the network. The advantage is that the routing tables for each sink will be reduced. The reduction of the number of routing entries can help to reduce the number of nodes which are not routable due to memory <b>overflow</b> of the <b>routing</b> tables.|$|R

The Scheme for Advanced <b>Overflow</b> <b>Routing</b> (SAPOR) is a method that enables flow based routing in IP networks. This paper presents an analytical model that allows the calculation of overflow probabilities for flows, transmitted via a bottleneck connection. The proposed model is verified by simulation and results are presented. Similar to the Erlang B formula, the proposed model {{can be used as}} a generic multi-rate blocking model, i. e. when call rates (required resources) are drawn from probability distributions.

40|$|Multihomed Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs) are typically connected to several transit ISPs. If cost {{is assigned to}} interconnecting resources, multihomed ISPs face the problem of cost efficient outbound traffic routing. In particular, this is relevant if the ISPs form customer to provider relationships and alternative billing schemes are used, i. e. volume or time based.

40|$|Small {{and medium}} sized {{businesses}} often operate local area networks that connect via service providers to the Internet. If multiple connections are required, {{there are two}} options available: A gateway router that operates the border gateway protocol or a simpler gateway appliance that mostly uses load balancing and often network address translation. However, there is no simple way to multi-home small networks, when access links have diverse performance parameters, capacities or costs. Dynamic <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> addresses this issue in a straightforward way. This paper discusses dynamic routing and details, how bandwidth resources can be managed. It gives a simple estimate that helps to forecast resources for routing decisions and it underlines {{the need for a}} bidirectional gateway routing mechanism, accounting simultaneously for upstream as well as downstream traffic...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{parallel}} global routing algorithm that concurrently processes routing subproblems corresponding to rectangular subregions covering the chip area. The algorithm uses at it core an existing integer programming (IP) formulation—both for routing each subproblem and for connecting them. Concurrent processing of the routing subproblems is desirable for effective parallelization. However, achieving no (or low) <b>overflow</b> global <b>routing</b> solutions without strong, coordinated algorithmic control is difficult. Our algorithm addresses this challenge via a patching phase that uses IP to connect partial routing solutions. Patching provides feedback to each routing subproblem {{in order to}} avoid overflow, later when attempting to connect them. The end result is a flexible and highly scalable distributed algorithm for global routing. The method is able to accept as input target runtimes for its various phases and produce high-quality solution within these limits. Computational results show that for a target runtime of 75 minutes, running on a computational grid of few hundred CPUs with 2 GB memory, the algorithm generates higher quality solutions than competing methods in the open literature...|$|R
50|$|There have {{recently}} been some concerns raised about this current system in Vancouver due {{to the effects of}} climate change. It is predicted that rainfall rates will increase in the lower mainland due to changes in climate and this could cause an increase in the amount of <b>overflow</b> water being <b>routed</b> to the ocean. For this reason Vancouver has committed to the gradual change from a combined sewer system to a separated sewer system by 2050. This would mean that only excess rainwater collected from streets and houses would be directed towards the ocean and all sewage would be processed by sewage treatment plants.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to reduce routing congestion during placement stage. The proposed approach {{is used as}} a postprocessing step in placement. Congestion reduction is based on local improvement on the existing layout, however, the approach has a global view of the congestion over the entire design. It uses integer linear program (ILP) to describe the problem of conflicts between multiple congested regions, and perform local improvement according to the solution of ILP. Approximation algorithm of the formulated ILP is studied and good approximation bounds are given. Experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the total <b>overflow</b> of global <b>routing</b> result. Due to its short running time, our approach is easily scalable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Shortest path routing schemes, like open {{shortest}} path first (OSPF), have shortcomings when networks are highly loaded. Traffic engineering of IP networks {{is required to}} avoid this problem. Current efforts suggest the optimisation of OSPF weights to balance the network load more evenly. Also, more advanced technologies, like multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), are proposed. One major problem of dynamic routing efforts that use OSPF is the fact that many traffic flows are influenced by single weight changes. We introduce SAPOR (scheme for alternative packet <b>overflow</b> <b>routing),</b> which realises a methodology that can remember the routing of packets for the duration of a micro flow. This allows the rerouting of overflow traffic. In this case, well known concepts and methodologies from conventional circuit switched teletraffic engineering can be adapted for IP networks...|$|E
40|$|Online {{services}} {{that rely on}} large scale server systems have become major energy users. These systems are generally dimensioned for peak loads and therefore have very low average utilisation, often around 20 - 30 %. This paper presents a mathematical performance analysis of a simple routing mechanism that uses staged <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> to assign requests to servers. The technique relies on a router, {{in conjunction with a}} server daemon. Idle servers are suspended; and suspended systems are returned to an active state by the Wake-on-LAN function. The number of active servers is proportional to the overall system utilisation and leads to a load proportional carbon footprint. Performance models are developed and used to analyse the proposed mechanism. A potential system design is briefly discussed. It is concluded that substantial power savings are possible using overflow routing; however, there is also significant effects on user performance {{as a result of the}} higher server utilisation...|$|E
40|$|Congestion-targeted RoQ (reduction {{of quality}} of service) DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacking is {{discussed}} in details for the first time. The principle of attacking is pointed out {{on the basis of}} the analysis of network capacity. The four categories of the attacking patterns such as pulsing attacking, round robin attacking, self-whisper attacking and flooding attacking, are also described. The defense schemes are proposed, which include the detection of three signals, such as RTS/CTS packets, signal interference frequency and retransmission times, and response scheme with ECN (explicit congestion notification) marking method. The extensive NS 2 simulation results show that the pulsing attacking mode leads to the great jitter of the goodput and delay. The increasing of delay and decreasing of goodput becomes obvious with the addition of attacking flows. The delay performance goes up to 110 times and goodput performance drops down to 77. 42 % when five attacking flows with the same rate occur. The complicated topology is more vulnerable and the distribution of attacking nodes will generate more obvious impacts. The dropping packets are also growing corresponding with the addition of attacking flows, because of IFQ (interface queue) <b>overflow</b> and <b>routing</b> overhead...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for (signal) interconnect power optimization at the global routing stage. In a typical design flow, the primary objective of global routing is minimization of wirelength and via consumption. Our framework takes a global routing solution that is optimized for this objective, and quickly generates a new solution that is optimized for signal power, with only a small, controlled degradation in wirelength. Our model of signal power includes layer-dependent fringe and area capacitances of the routes, and their spacing. Our framework is fast compared to the existing global routing procedures, thereby not causing much overhead and fitting well in the design flow to optimize signal power after wirelength minimization. The framework is based on Pareto-algebraic operations and generates multiple global routing solutions to provide a tradeoff between power and wirelength, thereby allowing the user to optimize power with a controlled degradation in wirelength. The generated solution remains free of <b>overflow</b> in <b>routing</b> resource usage. We experiment with large benchmarks from the ISPD 2008 suite and a 45 nm technology model. We show on average 19. 9 % power saving with at most 3 % wirelength degradation using the existing wirelength optimized solutions from the open literature...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new multi-packing tree (MP-tree) {{representation}} for macro placement to handle mixed-size designs. Based on binary trees, the MP-tree is very efficient, effective, and flexible for handling macro placement with various constraints. Given a global placement, our MP-tree-based macro placer optimizes macro positions, minimizes the macro displacement from the initial macro positions, and maximizes {{the area of the}} chip center for standard-cell placement and routing. Experiments based on the eight ISPD’ 06 placement contest benchmarks show that our macro placer combined with Capo 10. 2, NTUplace 3, or mPL 6 for standard-cell placement outperforms these state-of-the-art academic mixed-size placers alone by large margins in both robustness and quality. In addition to wirelength, experimented on five real industrial designs show that our method significantly reduce the average HPWL by 35 %, the average routed wirelength by 55 %, and the <b>routing</b> <b>overflows</b> than the counterpart with Capo 10. 2, implying that our macro placer leads to much higher routability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{different}} routing policies are studied and evaluated {{from the point}} of view of the network robustness, i. e. the capability of the network to well react to overloads and uncertain variations of the offered traffic. A class of simple dynamic <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> schemes among which Dynamic Adaptive Routing (DAR) and Optimal overflow Load Sharing (OLS) has been chosen for the analysis. The efficiency of such routing schemes has been evaluated both in nominal traffic conditions and in a set of significant overload conditions referring to the stability of the performance with respect to the Erlang Bound. Our simulative results show that efficiency is just lightly reduced in many overload conditions by using DAR and OLS, confirming the robustness of these routing schemes provided that trunk reservation is applied. 1.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the efficiency of}} dynamic resource pooling and allocation in a cloud computing system offering infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). We assume that the demand for service computing by virtual machines (VMs) follows a Poisson load pattern and that the response times of the provided computing services can be classified into several service categories that are governed by exponential service time patterns. A hierarchical, dynamic, class-dependent balancing policy based on a least-loading scheme is applied to provide a uniform utilization among the servers. It is derived from cascaded mutual <b>overflow</b> <b>routing</b> using information on the utilization of VM clusters of similar type on adjacent servers within this resource pool. Regarding the allocation of virtual machines of these different service types to the user demand by a pool of physical servers, we derive a Markovian loss model with adaptive routing induced by cascaded mutual overflow as effective, state-dependent load balancing policy. We determine its basic performance characteristics applying a Markovian fixed-point model. Based on the latter we gain insight {{on the power of}} the proposed dynamic load balancing policy among service classes...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{networks}} are mathematical models for traffic flows in networks with uncertainty. The {{goal of this}} thesis is to develop new methods for analyzing performance and stability of stochastic networks, helping to better understand and control uncertainty in complex distributed systems. The thesis considers three instances of stochastic networks, each representing a specific challenge for analytical modeling. The first case studies the impact of incomplete information to a queueing network with distributed admission control. Stability conditions for various admission policies are derived, together with a numerical algorithm for performance evaluation. In the second case, stochastic comparison is used to derive performance bounds for multiclass loss networks with <b>overflow</b> <b>routing.</b> The third model is a spatial random field generated by {{a large number of}} noninteracting sources, for which scaling and renormalization are used to show how the level of randomness of the individual sources may critically affect the macroscopic statistical properties of the field. The results of the thesis illustrate the feasibility of stochastic comparison and stochastic analysis in deriving approximations and performance bounds for complex physical networks with uncertainty. Approximations and performance bounds based on exact mathematical methods have the advantage that they explicitly state the type of circumstances required for the accuracy of the estimates. The resulting analytical formulas can sometimes reveal interesting properties that are not easily detected using numerical simulation. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The field {{programmable}} {{gate array}} (FPGA) is an attractive computational platform for many applications because of its customizable nature and modest development cost, in terms of both time and money. As FPGAs scale to increased logical capacities, designers have increased flexibility. However, the FPGA placement problem becomes more difficult at increased sizes. Increasingly, designers are encouraged to structure designs hierarchically and floor-plan. Floor-planning is a manual process which maps specified design submodules to selected physical regions of the FPGA device fabric. This thesis explores several of the effects that floor-planning has on submodules and the designs they comprise. A method is developed to explore the floor-planning impact on submod-ules independent of a full design. Six different submodules are independently subjected to varying timing constraints and to area constraints of varying aspect ratios and area allocations. The result-ing submodule minimum clock periods, <b>routing</b> <b>overflows,</b> and relocatabilities are assembled from millions of submodule implementations.

40|$|National audienceThe {{statistical}} {{control of}} discrete event simulations is usually based on empirical procedures {{to determine a}} b̈urn-inẗime period and an estimation period based on the time correlation properties of the studied system. Recent works in simulation of interacting systems of particles provide new algorithms, perfect samplers, that sample directly according the stationary distribution of the system. These algorithms provide independent samples of steady-state and so avoid the b̈urn-inẗime and time correlation problems. These techniques has been successfully applied {{in the domain of}} queueing networks with finite capacities and complex routing protocols. The aim of this short course is to introduce the perfect sampling technique for Markovian models. The focus will be on the complexity of the simulation process and the time reduction obtained by the monotonicity properties of the system. In particular, index routing policies (Bernoulli <b>routing,</b> <b>overflow,</b> join the shortest queue, etc.) are monotone and the performance of the sampler is sufficient to reach low probability events estimation by b̈rute force. ̈ These samplers have been implemented in a general simulation framework PSI 2 and applied in various contexts (queueing networks, job scheduling, call centers, brokering, [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} {{scales and}} frequency increases, a new design style is emerging, {{referred to as}} hybrid designs, which contain a mixture of random logic and datapath standard cell components. This work begins by demonstrating that conventional Half-PerimeterWire Le-ngth (HPWL) -driven placers under-perform in terms of regularity and Steiner Wire Length (StWL) for such hybrid designs, and the quality gap between manual placement and automatic placers is more pronounced as the designs become more datapath-oriented. Then, a new unified placement flow that simultaneously handles random logic and datapath standard cells is proposed that signifi-cantly improves the placement quality of the datapath while lever-aging the speed of modern state-of-the-art placement algorithms. The placement flow is built {{on top of a}} leading academic force-directed placer. It consists of a series of novel global and detailed placement techniques, collectively called Structure Aware Place-ment Techniques (SAPT). The techniques effectively integrate align-ment constraints into placement, overcoming the deficiencies of the HPWL objective. Experimental results comparing our placement flow with six state-of-the-art placers on the ISPD 2011 Datapath Benchmark Suite show at least a 32 % improvement in total StWL with over a 6 × improvement in total <b>routing</b> <b>overflow.</b> In addi-tion, the flow demonstrates an 8. 25 % improvement in total StWL on industrial hybrid designs...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{aggressive}} transistor scaling, modern-day CMOS circuits have continually {{increased in}} both complexity and productivity. Modern semiconductor designs have narrower and more resistive wires, thereby shifting the performance bottleneck to interconnect delay. These trends considerably impact timing closure {{and call for}} improvements in high-performance physical design tools {{to keep pace with}} the current state of IC innovation. As leading-edge designs may incorporate tens of millions of gates, algorithm and software scalability are crucial to achieving reasonable turnaround time. Moreover, with decreasing device sizes, optimizing traditional objectives is no longer sufficient. Our research focuses on (i) expanding the capabilities of standalone global routing, (ii) extending global routing for use in different design applications, and (iii) integrating routing within broader physical design optimizations and flows, e. g., congestion-driven placement. Our first global router relies on integer-linear programming (ILP), and can solve fairly large problem instances to optimality. Our second iterative global router relies on Lagrangian relaxation, where we relax the routing violation constraints to allowing <b>routing</b> <b>overflow</b> at a penalty. In both approaches, our desire is to give the router the maximum degree of freedom within a specified context. Empirically, both routers produce competitive results within a reasonable amount of runtime. To improve routability, we explore the incorporation of routing with placement, where the router estimates congestion and feeds this information to the placer. In turn, the emphasis on runtime is heightened, as the router will be invoked multiple times. Empirically, our placement-and-route framework significantly improves the final solution’s routability than performing the steps sequentially. To further enhance routability-driven placement, we (i) leverage incrementality to generate fast and accurate congestion maps, and (ii) develop several techniques to relieve cell-based and layout-based congestion. To broaden the scope of routing, we integrate a global router in a chip-design flow that addresses the buffer explosion problem...|$|R
40|$|Concern over {{flooding}} along {{rivers in}} the Prairie Pothole Region has stimulated {{interest in developing}} spatially distributed hydrologic models to simulate the effects of wet¬land water storage on peak river flows. Such models require spatial data on the storage volume and interception area of existing and restorable wetlands in the watershed of interest. In most cases, information on these model inputs is lacking because resolution of existing topographic maps is inadequate to estimate volume and areas of existing and restorable wetlands. Consequently, most studies have relied on wetland area to volume or interception area relationships to estimate wetland basin storage characteristics by using available surface area data obtained as a product from remotely sensed data (e. g., National Wetlands Inventory). Though application of areal input data to estimate volume and interception areas is widely used, {{a drawback is that}} there is little information available to provide guidance regarding the application, limita¬tions, and biases associated with such approaches. Another limitation of previous modeling efforts is that water stored by wetlands within a watershed is treated as a simple lump storage component that is filled prior to <b>routing</b> <b>overflow</b> to a pour point or gaging station. This approach does not account for dynamic wetland processes that influence water stored in prairie wetlands. Further, most models have not considered the influence of human-induced hydrologic changes, such as land use, that greatly influence quantity of surface water inputs and, ultimately, the rate that a wetland basin fills and spills. The goals of this study were to (1) develop and improve methodologies for estimating and spatially depicting wet-land storage volumes and interceptions areas and (2) develop models and approaches for estimating/simulating the water storage capacity of potentially restorable and existing wetlands under various restoration, land use, and climatic scenarios. To address these goals, we developed models and approaches to spatially represent storage volumes and interception areas of existing and potentially restorable wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin within Grant County, Minn. We then developed and applied a model to simulate wetland water storage increases that would result from restoring 25 and 50 percent of the farmed and drained wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin. The model simulations were performed during the growing season (May–October) for relatively wet (1993; 0. 67 m of precipitation) and dry (1987; 0. 32 m of precipitation) years. Results from the simulations indicated that the 25 percent restoration scenario would increase water storage by 27 – 32 percent and that a 50 percent scenario would increase storage by 53 – 63 percent. Additionally, we estimated that wetlands in the subbasin have potential to store 11. 57 – 20. 98 percent of the total precipitation that fell over the entire subbasin area (52, 758 ha). Our simulation results indicated that there is considerable potential to enhance water storage in the subbasin; however, evaluation and calibration of the model is necessary before simulation results can be applied to management and planning decisions. In this report we present guidance for the development and application of models (e. g., surface area-volume predictive models, hydrology simulation model) to simulate wetland water storage to provide a basis from which to understand and predict the effects of natural or human-induced hydrologic alterations. In developing these approaches, we tried to use simple and widely available input data to simulate wetland hydrology and predict wetland water storage for a specific precipitation event or a series of events. Further, the hydrol¬ogy simulation model accounted for land use and soil type, which influence surface water inputs to wetlands. Although information presented in this report is specific to the Mustinka subbasin, the approaches and methods developed should be applicable to other regions in the Prairie Pothole Region...|$|R
