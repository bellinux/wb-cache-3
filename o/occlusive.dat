5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery <b>occlusive</b> disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9â€“25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under <b>occlusive</b> dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic colitis {{is often}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} underlying cause. Non-occlusive ischemia develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; <b>occlusive</b> ischemia indicates that a blood clot or other blockage has cut off {{blood flow to the}} colon.|$|E

25|$|Organisation: {{following}} the thrombotic event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an <b>occlusive</b> thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel {{that leads to}} complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the <b>occlusive</b> thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen. For a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen {{rather than by the}} vasa vasorum.|$|E
25|$|Although an <b>occlusive</b> tumor may be {{suspected}} on a {{barium swallow}} or barium meal, {{the diagnosis is}} best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a flexible tube with a light and camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy.|$|E
25|$|Moisturizing agents (also {{known as}} emollients) are {{recommended}} {{at least once}} or twice a day. Oilier formulations appear to be better and water-based formulations are not recommended. It is unclear if moisturizers that contain ceramides are more or less effective than others. Products that contain dyes, perfumes, or peanuts should not be used. <b>Occlusive</b> dressings at night may be useful.|$|E

25|$|These methods all had merit, but the {{standard}} method for {{the healing of}} fractures was bed rest and restriction of activity. The search for a simpler, less-time consuming, method {{led to the development}} of the first modern <b>occlusive</b> dressings, stiffened at first with starch and later with plaster-of-paris. The ambulatory treatment of fractures was the direct result of these innovations. The innovation of the modern cast can be traced to, among others, four military surgeons, Dominique Jean Larrey, Louis Seutin, Antonius Mathijsen, and Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov.|$|E
25|$|Russert's {{longtime}} friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic coronary artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was <70 mg/dL) and exercise, {{and that he had}} performed well on a stress test in late April. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of coronary artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an <b>occlusive</b> coronary thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque.|$|E

[...] Acute DVT is characterized by pain and swelling and is usually <b>occlusive,</b> which means that it obstructs blood flow, whereas non-occlusive DVT is less symptomatic. The label [...] "chronic" [...] {{has been applied to}} symptomatic DVT that persists longer than 10 to 14 days. DVT that has no symptoms, but is found only by screening, is labeled asymptomatic or incidental.|$|E
500|$|Consonants {{are those}} sounds that have audible {{friction}} or closure {{at some point}} within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces {{a different set of}} consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called <b>occlusive</b> or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [...] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [...] in buzz (voiced sibilant).|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Interventional Radiologist, Dr. Charles Dotter {{began working}} on methods to {{visualize}} the coronary anatomy via sequential radiographic films. [...] He invented a method known as <b>occlusive</b> aortography in an animal model. [...] <b>Occlusive</b> aortography involved the transient occlusion of the aorta and subsequent injection of {{a small amount of}} radiographic contrast agent into the aortic root and subsequent serial x-rays to visualize the coronary arteries. [...] This method produced impressive images of the coronary anatomy. [...] Dotter later reported that all the animals used in the procedure survived.|$|E

5000|$|The Greco-Iberian {{alphabet}} contains 16 signs {{identical to}} Greek signs, {{except for the}} sign corresponding to the second rhotic consonant: five vowels, three voiced <b>occlusives</b> (labial, dental and velar), but only two voiceless <b>occlusives</b> (dental and velar), two sibilants, two rhotics, one lateral, and only one nasal sign.

2500|$|For example, Eastern Armenian {{speakers}} pronounce (...) as an aspirated [...] "t" [...] as in [...] "tiger", (...) {{like the}} [...] "d" [...] in [...] "develop", and (...) as a tenuis <b>occlusive,</b> sounding {{somewhere between the}} two as in [...] "stop." [...] Western Armenian has simplified the <b>occlusive</b> system into a simple division between voiced occlusives and aspirated ones; the first series corresponds to the tenuis series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both (...) and (...) as an aspirated [...] "t" [...] as in [...] "tiger", and the (...) letter is pronounced like the letter [...] "d" [...] as in [...] "develop".|$|E

5000|$|When a {{language}} is claimed to lack nasals altogether, as with several Niger-Congo languages or the PirahÃ£ {{language of the}} Amazon, nasal and non-nasal or prenasalized consonants usually alternate allophonically, {{and it is a}} theoretical claim {{on the part of the}} individual linguist that the nasal is not the basic form of the consonant. In the case of some Niger-Congo languages, for example, nasals occur before only nasal vowels. Since nasal vowels are phonemic, it simplifies the picture somewhat to assume that nasalization in <b>occlusives</b> is allophonic. There is then a second step in claiming that nasal vowels nasalize oral <b>occlusives,</b> rather than oral vowels denasalizing nasal <b>occlusives,</b> that is, whether [...] are phonemically [...] without full nasals, or [...] without prenasalized stops. Postulating underlying oral or prenasalized stops rather than true nasals helps to explain the apparent instability of nasal correspondences throughout Niger-Congo compared with, for example, Indo-European.|$|R
