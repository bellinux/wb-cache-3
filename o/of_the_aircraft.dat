5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming on the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> while on the ground. Ice makes {{the surface of the}} wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> and can affect its balance.|$|E

500|$|After {{their initial}} {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> flight data recorder, the BEA concluded that Lubitz deliberately crashed <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> He {{had set the}} autopilot to descend to [...] and accelerated <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descending <b>aircraft</b> several times thereafter. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> was travelling at [...] when it crashed into the mountain. The BEA preliminary report into the crash was published on 6 May 2015, six weeks later. It confirmed <b>the</b> initial analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> flight data recorder and revealed that during the earlier outbound Flight 9524 from Düsseldorf to Barcelona, Lubitz had practised setting the autopilot altitude dial to 100 feet several times while the captain was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockpit.|$|R

5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} scan inspection, the pantograph elevates the 3D scanner at the fuselage. A pan-tilt unit moves the scan device to acquire the hull.

5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on the sight head only adjusted for rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> around its roll axis.|$|E

50|$|The {{first thing}} {{investigators}} identified {{was a piece}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> right wing few meters from the mountain peak. That was the first part that came off. This chilled them, as in the same year, a Fokker F.10 crashed in Kansas, United States due to a structural failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> wing. Investigators suspected that this crash might be a similar case. But after scrutinizing the debris carefully, the theory was ruled out.|$|R

50|$|This {{accident}} {{was found to}} be due to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft's</b> plywood wing structures. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two surviving <b>aircraft's</b> vulnerability to similar problems, and for lack of spares parts, Falcon and Fiona were scrapped in September 1943.|$|R
5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant.

5|$|Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to drop {{supplies}} by parachute on Vukovar.
