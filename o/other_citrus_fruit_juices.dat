As microorganisms are becoming resistant to present day antibiotics, our study focuses on antimicrobial activity and phytochemical study of <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> against selected enteric pathogens. Biological active compounds present in the medicinal important <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> have always been of great interest to scientist. These compounds, not only play an important physiological and etiological role, but are also of commercial interest because of their multitude application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In the present study, the Lemon and Orange <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were subjected to screening against enteric pathogens, E. coli, Salmonella paratyphy B, and Shigella sonnei. Antimicrobial analysis was done by using agar well diffusion method against selected enteric bacteria. The MIC values were determined by using U. V. Spectrophotometer. The fresh crude Lemon <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> produced the highest antimicrobial activity against Salmonella para. B and Shigella sonnei followed by E. coli and fresh crude Orange <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> produced the highest antimicrobial activity against Shigella sonnei and Salmonella para.

Diet was assessed every 4 years by food frequency questionnaires. The authors confirmed 207 cases of clinically or histopathologically diagnosed oral premalignant lesions occurring between 1986 and 2002. Multivariate-adjusted relative risks were calculated from proportional hazards models. Significant inverse associations were observed with <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice,</b> and vitamin-C-rich <b>fruits</b> and vegetables, indicating 30 – 40 % lower risks with greater intakes (e. g., <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 relative risk 0. 65, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 42, 0. 99). Inverse associations with fruits did not vary by smoking status and were stronger in analyses of baseline consumption, with a 10 -year lag time to disease follow-up (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1 relative risk 0. 41, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 20, 0. 82; p 0. 01). No associations were observed with total vegetables or with b-carotene-rich or lycopene-rich fruits and vegetables. For current smokers, green leafy vegetables (ptrend 0. 05) and b-carotene-rich fruits and vegetables (ptrend 0. 02) showed significant linear trends of increased risk (one additional serving/day relative risk 1. 7).

In addition cancer cell line were treated by half-ripe and ripe <b>Citrus</b> Medica <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> and cellular vital capacity was determined by MTT. The <b>Citrus</b> Medica <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> was subsequenthy evaluated in terms of antimutagenicity and anticancer properties by a standard reverse mutation assay (Ames Test). This was performed with histidine auxotroph strain of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100). Thus, it requires histidine from a foreign supply to ensure its growth.
