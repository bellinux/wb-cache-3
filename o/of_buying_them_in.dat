50|$|In 1986, {{he set up}} {{a factory}} to {{manufacture}} jelly-filled cables, creating Sterlite Industries. He soon realized that the profitability of his business was volatile, fluctuating with the prices of his raw materials: copper and aluminium. So he decided to control his input costs by manufacturing the metals instead <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 1993, Sterlite Industries became the first private sector company in India to set up a copper smelter and refinery. In 1995, Sterlite Industries acquired Madras Aluminium, a ‘sick’ company that had been shut down for 4 years and held by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The next step of the backward integration process seemed natural: mining.|$|E

5000|$|Some custom knife {{makers have}} large followings of collectors. [...] Because demand far outweighs the supply, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for these knives to appreciate substantially within seconds <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> from the maker. The secondary market can range anywhere from 50% to 200% of the knife's original value.|$|R

50|$|While Obelix could hunt boar before, {{he begins}} to {{overwork}} for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> (and ridiculous clothing).

6000|$|... "But that can't be helped, you know," [...] said Mr. Glegg. [...] "If one o' {{the family}} chooses to <b>buy</b> <b>'em</b> <b>in,</b> they can, {{but one thing}} must be bid for as well as another." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{say that}} Douglas's popular sovereignty, {{establishing}} his sacred {{right in the}} people, if you please, if carried to its logical conclusion gives equally the sacred right {{to the people of}} the States or the Territories themselves to buy slaves wherever they can <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> cheapest; and if any man can show a distinction, I should like to hear him try it. If any man can show how the people of Kansas have a better right to slaves, because they want them, than the people of Georgia have to <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Africa, I want him to do it. I think it cannot be done. If it is [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] for the people to have slaves because they want them, it is popular sovereignty for <b>them</b> to <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Africa because they desire to do so.|$|R

50|$|The price {{finally reached}} £1,000 in early August {{and the level}} of selling was such that the price started to fall, {{dropping}} back to £100 per share before the year was out, triggering bankruptcies amongst those who had bought on credit, and increasing selling, even short selling—selling borrowed shares <b>in</b> the hope <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> back at a profit if the price fell.|$|R

60|$|Carol {{drove through}} an {{astonishing}} {{number of books}} from the public library and from city shops. Kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her disconcerting habit <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>them.</b> A book was a book, {{and if you had}} several thousand of <b>them</b> right here <b>in</b> the library, free, why the dickens should you spend your good money?
