5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side.</b> This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, Orion had a hero cult in {{the region}} of Boeotia. The number of places {{associated}} with his birth suggest that it was widespread. Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire. They had a tomb of Orion most likely at the foot of Mount Cerycius (now Mount Tanagra). Maurice Bowra argues that Orion was a national hero of the Boeotians, much as Castor and Pollux were for the Dorians. He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the Battle of Coronea in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> and defeated the Athenians.|$|E

5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} then {{defined a}} limit (the so-called Red Line), along the 15th parallel, extending from Mao to Abéché, {{and warned that}} they would not tolerate any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> of the line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habré retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for the Israelis {{although}} the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> and 161 of the Israelis.|$|E

5|$|Using radio {{messages}} Manekshaw {{addressed the}} Pakistani troops three {{times on the}} subject of surrender, assuring them that they would receive honourable treatment from the Indian troops. They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two messages were delivered as replies to the messages from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. These messages from the Pakistani commanders to their troops were to have a devastating effect <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E
5|$|While Spain was {{neutral in}} World War II, Franco's sympathies {{remained}} with the Axis powers and he considered entering the war <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side.</b> He maintained {{good relations with}} Nazi Germany and many Francoists remained sympathetic to Nazism. This led Spain to be shunned by the international community, especially the Western European democracies and the United States, in the immediate post-war period. Europe-wide popular demonstrations against the Franco government occurred in 1946. In the 1950s, a thawing of relations occurred as Cold War tensions escalated and Franco's hostility to communism made him a reliable ally. This would result in reluctance {{on the part of}} the US government to support measures which could destabilise the Franco government.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> {{and holding a}} pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side.</b> He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|The War of Chioggia erupted {{between the}} old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon {{involved}} Venice's neighbours. King Louis took Genoa's side; and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice's competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, {{made an effort}} to have Tvrtko join the war <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko's involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to take an active part in the conflict. The Ragusans started calling for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce fealty to Venice and return to Louis. Kotor failed to fulfill this promise, but instead promised fealty to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors' heritage. The political climate was ideal, since he was to take Kotor from his overlord's enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa, but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly to Louis.|$|E

5|$|The land {{offensive}} {{began on}} July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A. Miles disembarked {{off the coast}} of Guánica. After controlling the first skirmish, the Americans advanced to Coamo, where they engaged Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in battle. The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> and four on the American side. The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island's interior. They engaged in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side,</b> but were again refused.|$|E
5|$|On the October 13 {{episode of}} Raw, Orton asked The Authority {{to face the}} loser of John Cena and Dean Ambrose's No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Ambrose won the match, setting up a Hell in a Cell match between Orton and Cena. On the Raw before the event, Triple H {{revealed}} that the winner would receive a future WWE World Heavyweight Championship match against Brock Lesnar. Later in {{the night in a}} 3-on-2 handicap street fight which pitted Orton, Kane, and Seth Rollins against Cena and Ambrose, Orton picked up the win but was immediately attacked by Rollins with a Curb Stomp. At Hell in a Cell, Cena defeated Orton. The following night on Raw, Orton attacked Rollins with an RKO, thus defying The Authority for not controlling Rollins the previous week and beginning a face turn {{for the first time since}} 2013. On the November 3 Raw, after increasing frustration, Orton attacked Rollins during his Intercontinental Championship against Dolph Ziggler, causing Rollins to win by disqualification, and demanded a match with Rollins to settle their dispute, which Triple H granted in order to keep Orton <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side.</b> Rollins won, and Orton completed his face turn by attacking The Authority before being attacked by The Authority, which ended with Rollins executing a Curb Stomp onto the steel steps on Orton. He was then carried on a stretcher after he sustained a scripted injury so he could start filming The Condemned 2: Desert Prey.|$|E

5|$|US2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for {{the first}} time north of {{downtown}} Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>side</b> of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield {{on the south side of}} Sunday Lake, meeting M‑28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River. US2 and M‑64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770vehicles, compared to the overall average of 5,188vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M‑64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic.|$|E
