5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E

At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by {{the radio station}} on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, the latter <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, {{he is an}} efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as {{the first in the}} genre.|$|E

5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats.

5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

5|$|Character {{development}} is a primary element of Oblivion. At {{the beginning of the}} game, players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> descended into an historical cliché.|$|E

5|$|For {{self-governance}} purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>has</b> its own mayor (starosta) and council.

Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.|$|E

The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China {{during and after the}} Han dynasty.|$|E
