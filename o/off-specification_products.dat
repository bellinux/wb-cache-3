40|$|Gas phase {{polyethylene}} reactors {{are able}} to produce several different grades of polymer. Adapting to market conditions requires grade transitions, associated with costs in terms of raw material and temporary production of lower priced <b>off-specification</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, both stationary production and dynamic grade transitions are optimized to maximize profit, i. e., economic process optimization. A cost function for transitions that utilizes product quality variable intervals, specifying premium priced products, and that also gives incentives to produce products having quality variables on target, i. e., equal to a defined grade, is designed. A previously published reactor model is extended with quality variable models and several grade transitions are optimized and shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of synthetic polymers represents {{an important part}} of chemical industry. In these processes it is common that the same process is used for the {{production of}} different kind of products (various molecular weights, compositions, etc.). Therefore, beside the optimization of the operating conditions related to the production of different products, {{it is also important to}} minimize the time of the grade transition reducing the amount of <b>off-specification</b> <b>products.</b> This optimization can be considered as an optimal control problem. Among the wide range of tools and algorithms can be used to solve optimal control problems this paper studies the applicability of model predictive control (MPC) solutions.

40|$|In the {{production}} and processing of granular matter, mixing of solids plays an important role. Granular materials such as sand, polymeric particles, and fertilizers are processed in different apparatuses such as fluidized beds, rotary kilns, and spouted beds. In the operation of these apparatuses, proper mixing is essential, as it helps to prevent the formation of hot spots, <b>off-specification</b> <b>products,</b> and undesired agglomerates. In this article, we discuss various methods {{that are available to}} give quantitative information on the solids mixing state in granular systems based on a discrete description of the solids phase. We apply the different methods to two-fluid model simulations. It is found that some of these methods are grid-dependent; not reproducible; sensitive to macroscopic flow patterns; and/or able to calculate only overall mixing indices, rather than indices for each direction. We compare some methods described in the literature, and in addition, we propose two new methods that do not suffer from the disadvantages mentioned above. Simulations are performed for seven different operating pressures. It is found that mixing improves with operating pressure as a result of increased porosity in the dense phase. ...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{processes}} {{with complex}} reaction mechanisms generally lead to dynamic models which, while beneficial for predicting and capturing the detailed process behavior, are not readily amenable for direct use in online applications related to process operation, optimisation, control, and troubleshooting. Surrogate models can help overcome this problem. In this research article, {{the first part}} focuses on obtaining surrogate models for emulsion copolymerization of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), which is usually produced in a train of continuous stirred tank reactors. The predictions and/or profiles for several performance characteristics such as conversion, number of polymer particles, copolymer composition, and weight-average molecular weight, obtained using surrogate models are compared with those obtained using the detailed mechanistic model. In {{the second part of}} this article, optimal flow profiles based on dynamic optimisation using the surrogate models are obtained for the production of NBR emulsions with the objective of minimising the <b>off-specification</b> <b>product</b> generated during grade transitions...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{moving bed}} {{chromatography}} (SMBC) {{has emerged as}} a significant separation technology in the process industry. SMB operating parameters are chosen to satisfy various performance objectives such as maximization of purity or productivity and the choice of the objective is generally guided by process economics. From an industrial perspective, the SMB must be operated flexibly, so that the same unit can be operated to satisfy different objectives. Transiting from one objective to another entails large transition periods, resulting in an economic loss. We propose use of optimal transitions as an approach to minimizing transition time, reducing use of feed and desorbent during transition as well as reduction in <b>off-specification</b> <b>product</b> relative to a non-optimal, step change approach. Optimal transitions can also be used in recovering from feed upset scenarios. The above methods are demonstrated using simulations on a benchmark SMBC process for separation of glucose and fructose using Ca++ exchange resin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Reported herein are {{results from}} 50 1996 - 98 Colorado State University Industrial Assessment Center (CSU IAC) {{industrial}} assessments at small and medium-size manufacturing plants. The assessments {{were conducted by}} engineering faculty and students associated with the CSU IAC. Each assessment includes a full-day plant visit and follow-up engineering and economic analyses of data pertaining to plant operations. Assessment reports provide recommendations for implementation of practices that can conserve energy, reduce waste, and improve productivity. Results from the 50 assessments demonstrate that recommended productivity improvement practices can also prevent formation of wastes and polluting emissions. A total of 61 productivity improvement recommendations were made, 14 of which provide pollution prevention with concomitant, quantifiable cost savings. Such cost savings are associated with improving management of raw materials, reducing generation of <b>off-specification</b> <b>product,</b> recycling cooling water, improving inspection and testing procedures, reducing batch sizes, and upgrading production equipment. For the 14 productivity improvement recommendations with pollution prevention benefits, the annual cost savings due to pollution prevention are $ 502, 140, whereas the total annual cost savings for the 14 recommendations are $ 1, 484, 310. In other words, 34 % of the cost savings for these productivity improvement recommendations is attributable to pollution prevention. The results thus demonstrate that improving productivity in manufacturing operations can prevent formation of wastes and polluting emissions...|$|R
40|$|Poor powder flow {{leads to}} many {{problems}} during manufacturing {{and can lead}} to inaccurate dosing and <b>off-specification</b> <b>products.</b> Powder flowability is commonly assessed under relatively high applied loads using shear cells by characterising the unconfined yield strength at a range of applied loads. For applied stresses below 1 kPa, it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain reliable values of the unconfined yield strength. The bulk cohesion and tensile strength of the powder are then obtained by extrapolating the yield locus to zero and negative loads, respectively. However, the reliability of this approximation for a given material is not known. To overcome this limitation, techniques such as the Raining Bed Method, Sevilla Powder Tester and the newly-developed Ball Indentation Method may be used. In this paper, we report our measurement results of the tensile strength of glass beads, Î±-lactose monohydrate and various sizes of fluid catalytic cracking powders determined by the Sevilla Powder Tester and Raining Bed Method and compare them with those inferred from the Schulze Shear Cell. The results of the latter are also compared with those of the Ball Indentation Method. The outcome suggests {{that in the case of}} shear cell tests, the extrapolation of the yield locus to lower or negative loads is unsafe. The ball indentation method enables the characterisation of highly cohesive powders at very low compressive loads; however extrapolation to negative loads is still not reliable. In contrast, the Sevilla Powder Tester and Raining Bed Methods are able to characterise the tensile strength directly, but high bulk cohesion poses difficulties as the internal bed failure needs to be analysed in order to reliably estimate the tensile strength. These methods provide a better understanding of powder flow behaviour at low stresses, thus enabling a greater control of manufacturing processes...|$|E
40|$|The unsteady-state {{continuous}} rotary dissolver {{material balance}} code (USSCRD) {{is a useful}} tool with which to study {{the performance of the}} rotary dissolver under a wide variety of operating conditions. The code does stepwise continuous material balance calculations around each dissolver stage and the digester tanks. Output from the code consists of plots and tabular information on the stagewise concentration profiles of UO{sub 2 }, PuO{sub 2 }, fission products, Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 }, UO{sub 2 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }, fission product nitrates, HNO{sub 3 }, H{sub 2 }O, stainless steel, total particulate, and total fuel in pins. Other information about material transfers, stagewise liquid volume, material inventory, and dissolution performance is also provided. This report describes the development of the code, its limitations, key operating parameters, usage procedures, and the results of the analysis of several sets of operating conditions. Of primary importance in this work was the estimation of the steady-state heavy metal inventory in a 0. 5 -t/d dissolver drum. Values ranging from {similar_to} 12 to > 150 kg of U + Pu were obtained for a variety of operating conditions. Realistically, inventories are expected to be near the lower end of this range. Study of the variation of operating parameters showed significant effects on dissolver product composition from intermittent solids feed. Other observations indicated that the cycle times for the digesters and shear feed should be closely coupled in order to avoid potential problems with <b>off-specification</b> <b>product.</b> 19 references, 14 tables...|$|R
40|$|Project Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to develop an accurate and stable on-line sensor system to monitor color and composition on-line in polymer melts, to develop a scheme for using the output to control extruders to eliminate the energy, material and operational costs of <b>off-specification</b> <b>product,</b> and to combine or eliminate some extrusion processes. Background: Polymer extrusion processes are difficult to control because the quality achieved in the final product is complexly affected by the properties of the extruder screw, speed of extrusion, temperature, polymer composition, strength and dispersion properties of additives, and feeder system properties. Extruder systems are engineered to be highly reproducible so that when the correct settings to produce a particular product are found, that product can be reliably produced time after time. However market conditions often require changes in the final product, different products or grades may be processed in the same equipment, and feed materials vary from lot to lot. All of these changes require empirical adjustment of extruder settings to produce a product meeting specifications. Optical sensor systems that can continuously monitor the composition and color of the extruded polymer could detect process upsets, drift, blending oscillations, and changes in dispersion of additives. Development of an effective control algorithm using the output of the monitor would enable rapid corrections for changes in materials and operating conditions, thereby eliminating most of the scrap and recycle of current processing. This information could be used to identify extruder systems issues, diagnose problem sources, and suggest corrective actions in real-time to help keep extruder system settings within the optimum control region. Using these advanced optical sensor systems would give extruder operators real-time feedback from their process. They could reduce the amount of off-spec product produced and significantly reduce energy consumption. Also, because blending and dispersion of additives and components in the final product could be continuously verified, we believe that, in many cases, intermediate compounding steps could be eliminated (saving even more time and energy) ...|$|R
40|$|High density {{polyethylene}} {{is commonly}} {{produced by the}} slurry phase co-polymerisation of ethylene and other alkenes, using heterogeneous titanium-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts. During grade transitions, when reactor conditions are manipulated to change polymer properties, significant quantities of <b>off-specification</b> <b>product</b> result. Implementing a model-predictive controller based on a dynamic reactor model may allow for minimising losses during unsteady-state operation. Such a model must be developed from a fundamental understanding of polymerisation reaction kinetics and the interaction of effects at various scales, including those of catalyst sites, catalyst/polymer particles and reactor hydrodynamics. The model must also be computationally efficient enough for application to real-time control. The recently-developed pseudo-sites model {{was used as a}} fundamental kinetic explanation of polymer property distributions and catalyst activity profiles, in contrast to empirical multi-site models. Laboratory polymerisation experiments were performed at industrially-relevant conditions. Kinetic parameters were fitted to the data, using a novel proposed regression procedure to extract meaningful kinetic parameters. A dynamic reactor model was developed, based on the Segregation Approach. Whereas the more common Population Balance Model must consider multivariate distributions of population members within a chosen volume and requires partial differential equation solution, the Segregation Approach can generate the moments of a distribution by evaluating the evolution of properties without requiring solution over the whole volume. The Segregation Approach and PBM were rigorously compared in the context of Particle Size Distributions, and the Segregation Approach shown to be an order of magnitude more computationally efficient. Steady-state industrial data was used to reconcile model predictions for laboratory and industrial polymerisation. This was the first application of the pseudo-sites model to laboratory data, and first extension to industrial scale. Unsteady-state data from three industrial grade transitions was used to validate the reactor model, which closely matched industrial reactor performance. The model simulated 30 - 40 hours of real time in 15 - 25 seconds of calculation time. The reactor model was used to propose improved grade transition strategies; transition duration and waste production were improved by 20 - 40 %. The reactor model has been shown to accurately reproduce real-world results, and is computationally efficient enough to be applied to model-based control applications...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} one of the severe problem arise by the usage of amine in the removal of acid gases namely carbon dioxide (CO 2) which is foaming. Foaming can cause {{reduction}} integrity of plant operation, excessive loss of absorption solvents, premature flooding, reduction in plant throughput, <b>off-specification</b> of <b>products</b> and high absorption solvent carryover to downstream plants. Foaming tendency can be experimentally evaluated by variation of parameters, such as temperature, concentrations and type of impurities (sodium chloride, acetic acid, iron sulphide). Prior to each experiment, aqueous solutions of MDEA of different concentration are prepared by volume (for concentration parameter), the prepared solutions are heated in a temperature bath to a set temperature (for temperature parameter) and different impurities are added into the solution (for impurities parameter). Effect of all this parameters will be evaluated based on height of foam in millilitre (ml) and collapse time of foaming in seconds (s). Nitrogen gas (N 2) will be use in this experiment as bubble gas. Results reveal that increase the pure MDEA concentration will decrease the foaminess. Similarly results also indicated that by increase the solution temperature will decrease the foam formation. For the investigation of foaming on temperature parameter, MDEA-Pz solution show greater to contribute on foaminess than pure MDEA solution at same amount of MDEA used. At the same amount of the impurities, iron sulphide appeared as the most influential contaminant to the foam formation, which promoted the highest foamability in any concentrations of piperazine-MDEA solutio...|$|R
