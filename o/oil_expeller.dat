The process energy input requirements are {{important factors in}} oil extraction and biodiesel production. This research work investigated oil extraction from flax seeds and compared extraction yield with the energy load. The effect of moisture content on the oil yield was compared between a mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>expeller,</b> organic solvent extraction, organic solvent and microwave assisted, organic solvent and ultrasonic assisted, and combined microwave and ultrasonic with organic solvent. The maximum oil yields % wt/wt from these techniques was 22. 6 %, 36. 3 %, 10. 0 %, 42. 0 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. The moisture content {{had a significant effect}} on oil yield with the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>expeller,</b> organic solvent method and ultrasonic assisted extraction, whereas no or little effect was found on microwave-assisted extraction. The microwave-assisted extraction showed better results compared with the ultrasonic-assisted and combined treatment methods. The relative energy consumption of these processes was experimentally investigated; energy ratios were calculated based on the amount of energy recovered to the amount of energy supplied to the flax seed for oil extraction. The net energy ratios showed that microwave-assisted extraction had the highest (25. 21 %), followed by organic solvent method (14. 04 %), ultrasonic method (6. 33 %) and lowest was with combined ultrasonic and microwave assisted treatment (5. 73 %). These results showed that flax seed oil can be extracted using microwave-assisted methods efficiently and in an energy feasible manner.

40|$|Context: Noise of {{machines}} in various agro-based industries {{was found to}} be the major occupational hazard for the workers of industries. The predominant noise sources need to be identified and the causes of high noise need to be studied to undertake the appropriate measures to reduce the noise level in one of the major agro-based industries, oil mills. Aims: To identify the predominant noise sources in the workrooms of oil mills. To study the causes of noise in oil mills. To measure the extent of noise exposure of oil mill workers. To examine the response of workers towards noise, so that appropriate measures can be undertaken to minimize the noise exposure. Settings and Design: A noise survey was conducted in the three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India. Materials and Methods: Information like output capacity, size of power source, maintenance condition of the machines and workroom configurations of the oil mills was collected by personal observations and enquiry with the owner of the mill. Using a Sound Level Meter (SLM) (Model- 824, Larson and Davis, USA), equivalent SPL was measured at operator&#x 2032;s ear level in the working zone of the workers near each machine of the mills. In order to study the variation of SPL in the workrooms of the oil mill throughout its operation, equivalent SPL was measured at two appropriate locations of working zone of the workers in each mill. For conducting the noise survey, the guidelines of Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) were followed. Grid points were marked {{on the floor of the}} workroom of the oil mill at a spacing of 1 m x 1 m. SPL at grid points were measured at about 1. 5 m above the floor. The direction of the SLM was towards the nearby noisy source. To increase accuracy, two replications were taken at each grid point. All the data were recorded for 30 sec. At the end of the experiment, data were downloaded to a personal computer. With the help of utility software of Larson and Davis, USA, equivalent SPL and noise spectrum at each reading was obtained. Noise survey map of equivalent SPL was drawn for each oil mill by drawing contour lines on the sketch of the oil mill between the points of equal SPL. The floor area in the oil mill where SPL exceeded 85 dBA was identified from the noise survey map of each oil mill to determine the causes of high level of noise. Subjective assessment was done during the rest period of workers and it was assessed with personal interview with each worker separately. Demographic information, nature of work, working hours, rest period, experience of working in the mill, degree of noise annoyance, activity interference, and psychological and physiological effects of machine noise on the worker were asked during the interview. These details were noted in a structured form. Statistical Analysis Used: Nil. Results: The noise survey conducted in three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India revealed that about 26 &#x 0025; of the total workers were exposed to noise level of more than 85 dBA. Further, 10 &#x 0025; to 30 &#x 0025; floor areas of workrooms, where <b>oil</b> <b>expellers</b> are provided have the SPL of more than 85 dBA. The noise in the oil mills was dominated by low frequency noise. The predominant noise sources in the oil mills were seed cleaner and power transmission system to <b>oil</b> <b>expellers.</b> Poor maintenance {{of machines}} and use of bamboo stick to prevent the fall of belt from misaligned pulleys were the main reason of high noise. Noise emitted by the electric motor, table ghani and <b>oil</b> <b>expellers</b> in all the oil mills was well within 85 dBA. Subjective response indicated that about 63 &#x 0025; of the total workers felt that noise interfered with their conversation. About 16 &#x 0025; each were of the opinion that noise interfered in their work and harmed their hearing. About 5 &#x 0025; of workers stated that the workroom noise gave them headaches. Conclusions: The workers engaged in the workrooms of the oil mills are exposed to high noise, which will have detrimental effect on their health.

40|$|ABSTRACT. According to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, {{the use of}} ultra‐low sulfur diesel (ULSD) {{has been}} {{mandated}} for all on‐highway transportation diesels since 2006. To comply with the EPA regulations, biodiesel must meet the same ULSD standard for total sulfur which is set at a maximum of 15 ppm. Generally, biodiesel contains lower sulfur than fossil diesel. However, due to the diversity of biodiesel feedstocks, {{questions have been raised}} about their sulfur content and the sulfur content of the biodiesel made from them. The objective of this research was to gain basic knowledge about how the sulfur content in biodiesel is affected by the sulfur content of different feedstocks. Sulfur in oilseeds, seed meals, oils and fats, and biodiesel were investigated according to ASTM D 5453. Samples of different feedstocks for biodiesel production were investigated. Results showed that sulfur content varies greatly from one source to another. The highest sulfur in seeds and meals was found in rapeseed and mustard, at the level of 9, 000 and 15, 000 ppm, respectively. <b>Oils</b> from mechanical <b>expeller</b> presses contained very low levels of sulfur, although some were still higher than 15 ppm. Animal fats and waste vegetable oils contained relatively higher sulfur levels and were frequently above 15 ppm. It was observed that sulfur was significantly reduced when the oils and fats were processed into biodiesel. Results showed that most of the biodiesel samples investigated in this study contained less than 15 ‐ppm sulfur. Feedstocks which contain a high percentage of free fatty acids (FFA) must be treated with sulfuric acid to reduce the FFA level before transesterification. In these cases, care is needed during phase separation to exclude sulfur from the fuel layer...|$|R

Five {{multiparous}} Finnish Ayrshire cows fed {{red clover}} silage-based diets {{were used in}} a 5 ? 5 Latin square with 21 -d experimental periods to evaluate the effects of various plant <b>oils</b> or camelina <b>expeller</b> on animal performance and milk fatty acid composition. Treatments consisted of 5 concentrate supplements containing no additional lipid (control), or 29 g/kg of lipid from rapeseed oil (RO), sunflower-seed oil (SFO), camelina-seed oil (CO), or camelina expeller (CE). Cows were offered red clover silage ad libitum and 12 kg/d of experimental concentrates. Treatments {{had no effect on}} silage or total dry matter intake, whole-tract digestibility coefficients, milk yield, or milk composition. Plant oils in the diet decreased short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acid (6 : 0 - 16 : 0) concentrations, including odd- and branched-chain fatty acids and enhanced milk fat 18 : 0 and 18 -carbon unsaturated fatty acid content. Increases in the relative proportions of cis 18 : 1, trans 18 : 1, nonconjugated 18 : 2, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat were dependent on the fatty acid composition of oils in the diet. Rapeseed oil in the diet was associated with the enrichment of trans 18 : 1 (? 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9), cis- 9 18 : 1, and trans- 7,cis- 9 CLA, SFO resulted in the highest concentrations of trans- 5, trans- 10, and trans- 11 18 : 1, ? 9, 11 CLA, ? 10, 12 CLA, and 18 : 2 n- 6, whereas CO enhanced trans- 13 - 16 18 : 1, ? 11, 15 18 : 2, ? 12, 15 18 : 2, cis- 9,trans- 13 18 : 2, ? 11, 13 CLA, ? 12, 14 CLA, ? 13, 15 CLA, ? 9, 11, 15 18 : 3, and 18 : 3 n- 3. Relative to CO, CE resulted in lower 18 : 0 and cis- 9 18 : 1 concentrations and higher proportions of trans- 10 18 : 1, trans- 11 18 : 1, cis- 9,trans- 11 CLA, cis- 9,trans- 13 18 : 2, and trans- 11,cis- 15 18 : 2. Comparison of milk fat composition responses to CO and CE suggest that the biohydrogenation of unsaturated 18 -carbon fatty acids to 18 : 0 in the rumen was less complete for camelina lipid supplied as an expeller than as free oil. In conclusion, moderate amounts of plant oils in diets based on red clover silage had no adverse effects on silage dry matter intake, nutrient digestion, or milk production, but altered milk fat composition, with changes characterized as a decrease in saturated fatty acids, an increase in trans fatty acids, and enrichment of specific unsaturated fatty acids depending on the fatty acid composition of lipid supplements.

After eight months {{as a part of the}} University student transport fleet, significant combustion chamber carbon deposits were seen at high peanut oil concentration. Indirect and direct injection instrumented laboratory engines were operated on the 200 hour E. M. A. durability test using ZOv/o and EOv/o peanut oiyD 2 blends. Both types of engines passed the durability test when 20 % blends were used. Extensive tests of a mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>expeller</b> and a supercritical extraction system were conducted to examine the feasibility of farm-scale biodiesel fuel production. The mechanical expeller (or screw press) efficiently recovered oil from a variety of oilseeds. A series of studies has been conducted to determine if a mixture of selected triglycerides might be a satisfactory biodiesel fuel: oilseeds containing such a mixture might prove to be a cost-effective source of biodiesel. Plant breeding to change seed oil composition would be materially aided by biotechnology techniques. Properties of pure triglycerides were compared to those of D 2 and methyl esters of fatty acids. Density, dynamic viscosity, heat capacity, boiling points and heat of combustion suggested that medium and short chain triglycerides were promising candidates. Simulated atomization studies and actual engine screening tests showed improved combustion characteristics when compared to peanut or soybean oil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:A ghani is {{a machine}} and pestle device which grinds oilseed into fine {{particles}} and extract oil from it. The oilseeds and subsequently the expressed oil {{are held in}} a scooped circular pit in the exact centre of a circular mortar made of stone or wood. In it works a stout, upright pestle which descends from a top curved or angled piece, in which the pestle rests in a scooped-out hollow that permits the pestle to rotate, eased by some soapy or oily lubricant. Today the single angled piece {{takes the form of}} two shorter pieces pinioned or chained together. The bottom of the lower angled piece is attached to a load-beam; one end of the load-beam rides around the outside of the barrel, while the other is yoked to the animal. The load-beam is weighted down with either heavy stones or even the seated operator. As the animal moves in a circular ambit, the pestle rotates, exerting lateral pressure on the upper chest of the pit, first pulverizing the oilseed and then crushing out its oil. But with the advent of <b>oil</b> <b>expeller</b> technology, almost all ghani were closed down. But still some ghani are running which are now made of iron and steel and it is driven by 2 HP motor. In India, oil extraction machine for extracting oil from seeds was designed and fabricated for market oriented production. The procedures employed include the design stage, construction and testing. The machine components are: Wooden hopper, wooden crusher, Connecting Rod, The reduction gear, the electric motor (2 hp, 3 -phase), the frame, the belt. oil are produced on a large scale which is used for various purposes such as Edible etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} World War II {{cut off from}} the North American {{continent}} supplies of imported vegetable oils. This focused attention on a search for new plant sources, increased production from available sources and alteration of available vegetable oils by physical and chemical processes to meet industrial demands. This resulted in stimulation of the vegetable oil industry. The maintenance of this industry against competition from oil exporting countries requires production of superior oil products at costs which will not be excessive. In addition to production of oils in competition with imported oils, there has been an increased demand for modified oils specifically adapted for certain purposes, e. g., fast-drying oils. The modification of vegetable oils may be aided by a knowledge of the acids and glycerides that are present. Sunflower seed (Helianthus annus) is grown extensively in Russia, Argentine, China, Hungary and United States. Commercial production of sunflower seed in Canada has increased rapidly since 1941 as a war measure. The two main varieties are Sunrise and Mennonite, which are adapted to regions of a relatively long frost free period. Approximately 20, 000 acres were seeded in Manitoba in 1945, and two <b>oil</b> <b>expeller</b> mills have been built in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The oil is an edible, semi-drying oil used extensively for Cooking and salad oils, shortenings and, to a limited extent, for paints and varnishes. Jamieson (63) gives the following fatty acid composition: oleic 33. 4, linoleic 57. 5, palmitic 3. 5, stearic 2. 9, arachidic 0. 6 and lignoceric 0. 4. Linolenic acid is not detected by chemical analyses. The present investigation Was undertaken to determine: (1) the relation of iodine value to fatty acid composition, (2) the glyceride structure by fractional crystallization, (3) if changes in the glyceride structure induced by physical and chemical treatment, such as molecular rearrangements, could be detected by fractional crystallization...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study to}} detoxify Jatropha curcas seed four {{potential}} detoxification methods were tested for their effectiveness. The first method entailed oil expulsion from unshelled Jatropha curcas seed using a Sunhdra industrial <b>oil</b> <b>expeller.</b> The second method involved laboratory-based petroleum-ether solvent extraction of shelled and minced kernels. Thirdly, shelled kernels were subjected to industrial detoxification that involved double solvent extraction with the hexane-ethanol system accompanied by moist-heat treatment at 90 °C for 30 min. The fourth method was {{an extension of the}} third whereby the meal generated was wet extruded (126 °C, 2 atmospheres, 10 min contact time) followed by re-extraction with hexane and moist heat treatment (121 °C for 30 min). The detoxification methods had significant (P< 0. 0001) effect on both the anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) and the proximate composition of the meals. Oil expulsion left the phorbol esters (PEs) of the unshelled seed at 0. 70 mg g 1, laboratory petroleum-ether extraction reduced the PEs content by 67. 69 % from 6. 5 mg g 1 in the raw shelled kernels to 2. 10 mg g 1, double solvent extraction followed by moist-heat treatment reduced PEs by 70. 77 % to 1. 90 mg g 1. Double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction with hexane and moist-heat treatment reduced PEs content to 0. 80 mg g 1, an 87. 69 % decrease. All the methods except laboratory petroleum-ether solvent extraction managed to completely inactivate trypsin inhibitors in the meals. Total phenolics (TPs) content was lowest (P< 0. 0001) in the oil-expulsion produced meal (8. 50 g Kg 1) while the laboratory petroleum-ether produced meal contained 64. 57 g Kg 1 TPs. Oil-expulsion and double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction and moist-heat treatment completely inactivated lectins in the meals. The high chemical nutrient potential of Jatropha curcas seed (crude protein, calcium and phosphorus) is only realised with shelling and extraction of most of the oil. None of the tried methods managed to completely detoxify the Jatropha curcas seed. The two most ‘effective methods’ reduced the PEs to 0. 70 and 0. 80 mg g 1, respectively compared to the non-toxic variety with 0. 11 mg g 1 PEs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSustainable {{development}} requires combining {{economic viability}} with energy and environment conservation and ensuring social benefits. It is conceptualized that for designing a micro industry for sustainable rural industrialization, all these aspects should be integrated right up front. The concept includes; (a) utilization of local produce for value addition in {{a cluster of}} villages and enhancing income of the target population; (b) use of renewable energy and total utilization of energy generated by co and trigeneration (combining electric power production with heat utilization for heating and cooling); (c) conservation of water and complete recycling of effluents; (d) total utilization of all wastes for achieving closure towards a zero waste system. Enhanced economic viability and sustainability is achieved by integration of appropriate technologies into the industrial complex. To prove the concept, a model Micro Industrial Complex (MIC) {{has been set up}} in a semi arid desert region in Rajasthan, India at village Malunga in Jodhpur district. A biomass powered boiler and steam turbine system is used to generate 100 - 200 KVA of electric power and high energy steam for heating and cooling processes downstream. The unique feature of the equipment is a 100 - 150 kW back-pressure steam turbine, utilizing 3 - 4 tph (tonnes per hour) steam, developed by M/s IB Turbo. The biomass boiler raises steam at about 20 barg 3 tph, which is passed through a turbine to yield about 150 kW of electrical power. The steam let out at a back pressure of 1 - 3 barg has high exergy and this is passed on as thermal energy (about 2 MW), for use in various applications depending on the local produce and resources. The biomass fuel requirement for the boiler is 0. 5 - 0. 75 tph depending on its calorific value. In the current model, the electricity produced is used for running an <b>oil</b> <b>expeller</b> to extract castor oil and the castor cake is used as fuel in the boiler. The steam is used in a Multi Effect Distillation (MED) unit for drinking water production and in a Vapour Absorption Machine (VAM) for cooling, for banana ripening application. Additional steam is available for extraction of herbs such as mint and processing local vegetables. In this paper, we discuss the financial and economic viability of the system and show how the energy, water and materials are completely recycled and how the benefits are directed to the weaker sections of the community...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is {{the only}} {{possible}} reciprocal to petro diesel and a boon to the fast depleting fossil fuel resources. Biofuel is produced from different feedstock including Algae, seeds of some terrestrial plants like Jatropha curcas, pongamia, castor, palm and oily wastes. The thesis addresses the multi-dimensional areas associated with the biodiesel production processes, covering the entire scope from seed based to non-terrestrial microalgae feedstock cultivation, extraction and its efficient conversion into liquid fuels. Design and development of efficient screw press expeller for oil expression from jatropha curcas seeds was the first investigation. This study is aimed to make efficient screw expeller to cater massive Jatropha biomass and its oil extraction. Experimental validation of the simulation is used to improve <b>oil</b> <b>expeller</b> for Jatropha seed by fabricating the expeller following the design and analysis by ANSYS FLUENT codes. An oil yield in excess of 98 %, as compared to a maximum 75 % for existing screw expellers, was achieved in practical runs which is very promising. An innovative airlift tubular photobioreactor was developed for growing algae in simulated conditions. Algal strain Chlorella sp was inoculated in photobioreactor which was sparged with air and carbon dioxide. The novel photobioreactor recorded a maximum experimental average yield of 0. 65 g/L. day (13. 3 g/m 2. day) as compared to theoretical modeled yield of 0. 82 g/L. day (14. 26 g/m 2. day), suggesting the device can be efficiently and cost-effectively employed {{in the production of}} algal biomass for biofuels. Supercritical Carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) fluid extraction (SCFE) was carried out to extract oil from Jatropha Curcas L. and microalgae (Chlorella Vulgaris) for biofuel production. The extraction was performed at temperature ranges of 40 - 80 oC and pressure of 4000 - 9000 psi in-order to investigate the optimum process parameters for Jatropha Curcas and microalgae biomass. The optimum yield for Jatropha was found to be 30. 6 wt% and for microalgae it was 17. 7 wt% (based on total oil contents present in the biomass) which was in close agreement with the time consuming traditional n-hexane based solvent extraction. The algal oil was then transesterified into biodiesel using nano-photo heterogeneous catalyst. The biodiesel produced using photosensitive catalyst was then characterized by using analytical techniques like GCMS and NMR and results are discussed. The physical properties of biodiesel are also analyzed according to ASTM standard...|$|E
