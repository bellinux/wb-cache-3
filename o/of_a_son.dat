5|$|The government's income {{came from}} five {{principal}} sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, {{such as when}} it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land, wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors.

50|$|It {{appears that}} Cynegils became king {{on the death}} of King Ceolwulf c. 611. His {{relationship}} to Ceolwulf is uncertain. Cynegils is variously described in West Saxon sources as being <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Ceolwulf, <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Ceol brother <b>of</b> Ceolwulf, <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Ceola <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Cutha, <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Cuthwine <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Ceawlin, and <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Cuthwulf son of Cuthwine. Several of the sources give Cynegils a brother named Ceolwald, described as the grandfather of King Ine. Although the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Wessex king lists portray the West Saxons as ruled by a single king, {{it is likely that the}} kingship was shared between two or more kings.|$|R
5000|$|In the Discworld {{series by}} Terry Pratchett, magical {{properties}} {{are attributed to}} the number eight rather than seven. Traditionally on the Discworld, <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> becomes <b>a</b> wizard. A wizard's eighth son—the eighth <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> (<b>an</b> unlikely and deliberately discouraged event)—is a Sourcerer, a dangerously powerful wizard. In the novel Equal Rites, instead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> <b>a</b> daughter is born, but due to a dying wizard passing on his staff before checking the child's gender, the daughter receives the wizarding powers normally given to the eighth son. This causes problems as females {{are supposed to be}} witches, and males wizards, due to each gender having <b>a</b> different method <b>of</b> thinking, and the powers associated with each title are not interchangeable. The novel Sourcery centers on the unlikely story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wizard's eighth <b>son</b> - the Sourcerer.|$|R
5|$|Bhimsen Thapa {{was born}} in August 1775 at Pipal Thok village of Gorkha district, to father Amar Singh Thapa (Sardar)(sanu) and mother Satyarupa Maya. His {{ancestors}} were members of Bagale Thapa clan from Jumla who migrated eastwards. His grandfather was Bir Bhadra Thapa, a courtier in Prithvi Narayan Shah's army. Bhimsen Thapa had four brothers—Nain Singh Thapa, Bhaktabar Singh Thapa, Amrit Singh Thapa, and Ranabir Singh Thapa. From his step-mother, he had two brothers—Ranbam and Ranzawar. While it is not certain when Bhimsen got married, he had three wives with whom he begot one son, that died {{at an early age}} in 1796, and three daughters – Lalita Devi, Janak Kumari and Dirgha Kumari. Lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> caused him to adopt Sher Jung Thapa, son of his brother Nain Singh Thapa.|$|E
5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life. By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E

5|$|Many {{designers}} {{were involved}} in the construction of memorials, but some became particularly well known for their work in this area. Many of the sculptors active on the memorials were established, Victorian-era individuals; the war had disrupted the training of a new generation, and many young sculptors had been killed. Some attempts were made to give preference to designers who had fought in the war, but this was far from universal. In British circles, Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker, Reginald Blomfield and Charles Holden formed the core of the established artists; these were joined by Charles Sargeant Jagger, Gilbert Ledward and Eric Gill from the younger generation. Pietro Porcelli was a particularly prolific Australian designer.

5|$|Meanwhile, in Lorraine, Charles V {{was without}} an heir and Marguerite-Louise, as the {{daughter}} of a Lorrainer princess, delegated the right to succeed to the duchy to her elder son, Ferdinando. Grand Duke Cosimo tried to get his son international recognition as heir-apparent, to no avail. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, supported Cosimo's claim, not wanting to see Lorraine revert to France. The Treaties of Nijmegen, which concluded the Franco-Dutch War, did not rubber stamp Cosimo's ambitions, as he had wished. The Lorrainer question was concluded with the birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> to Charles V in 1679, ending Cosimo's dream of a Medici cadet branch, dreams which were to be revived in 1697 by Gian Gastone's marriage to an heiress.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927.

This may be {{because he was a}} child <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents.
