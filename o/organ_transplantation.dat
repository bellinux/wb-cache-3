5|$|Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, FRS, FRCS (3 April 1911– 10 March 2001) was an English {{surgeon and}} {{scientist}} principally remembered for his research into <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees {{in electrical engineering}} and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs.|$|E

It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{massacre}} of the Uchiha clan {{at the start of}} the series, there were only four living people who possess the Sharingan: Sasuke Uchiha; his brother, Itachi; Obito Uchiha; and Kakashi Hatake. Itachi had died prior to the Fourth Great Ninja War, in which Obito meets his demise while Kakashi has his Sharingan removed in exchange for his normal eye. Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's test subjects who has a unique ability of accepting tissue and <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation,</b> Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage.

5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation</b> or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E

25|$|ABO-incompatible (ABOi) {{transplantation}} is {{a method}} of allocation in <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation</b> that permits more efficient use of available organs regardless of ABO blood type, which would otherwise be unavailable due to hyperacute rejection.

Normal ABO-compatibility rules may be observed for all recipients. This means that anyone may receive a transplant of a type-O organ, and consequently, type-O recipients {{are one of the}} biggest beneficiaries of ABO-incompatible transplants.

25|$|Most organ {{donation}} for <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation</b> {{is done in}} the setting of brain death. However, in Japan this is a fraught point, and prospective donors may designate either brain death or cardiac death – see <b>organ</b> <b>transplantation</b> in Japan. In some nations (for instance, Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Spain and France) everyone is automatically an organ donor, although some jurisdictions (such as Singapore, Portugal, Poland, New Zealand, or Netherlands) allow opting out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or next-of-kin is required for {{organ donation}}. The non-living donor is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If a brain-dead individual is not an organ donor, ventilator and drug support is discontinued and cardiac death is allowed to occur.|$|E

40|$|The term {{transplantation}} tolerance {{is considered}} for a long-term graft survival without the need of immunosuppressive therapy.

Results of some studies have shown that doses of immunosuppressive agents can be reduced to a minimum and patients might survive for years without an immunosuppression in few cases.
