A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to the surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E

5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

25|$|An {{oversight}} in {{the application}} of the no-hair theorem is the assumption that the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; what if they were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? Actually, this is what is realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and {{can be seen as a}} consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> which are consistent with the area, , of the black hole and the topology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.|$|E

25|$|The entropy is {{proportional}} to the logarithm of the number of microstates, the ways a system can be configured microscopically while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged.

25|$|This {{idea was}} made more precise by Leonard Susskind, {{who had also}} been {{developing}} holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> {{of a black hole}} is a complete description of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> This argument was put forward by the geographer Strabo (c.64BC– 24AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the Mediterranean Sea since at least the time of Homer, citing a line from the Odyssey as indicating that the poet Homer knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. Strabo cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} aircraft losing altitude, falling into a sideslip and descending into the ground, first hitting it with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and lost sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very long flight and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds.|$|E
