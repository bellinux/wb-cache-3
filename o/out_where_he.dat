5|$|He later {{enlisted in}} the Ottoman army when World War I broke <b>out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{received}} military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus. Returning to Jableh before the war's end, al-Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation. His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh's militia. By 1919, French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent Arab state. During this period, al-Qassam's Jableh militia fought against local French-backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city. The Alawites were eventually repelled, but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control. Consequently, al-Qassam {{and many of his}} disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of Zanqufeh to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the start}} of a push for Hardy, and at Survivor Series, Hardy and Triple H were the last two {{standing}} to win the traditional elimination match. Hardy began an on and off tag team with Triple H, which eventually led to a respectful feud between the two. The rivalry continued at Armageddon, when Hardy defeated Triple H to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the Royal Rumble, Hardy and Randy Orton engaged in a personal feud, which began when Orton kicked Hardy's brother, Matt, in the head in the storyline. Hardy, in retaliation, performed a Swanton Bomb on Orton from the top of the Raw set and seemed to have all the momentum after coming out on top in their encounters. Hardy, however, lost the title match at the Royal Rumble, but was named as one of six men to compete in an Elimination Chamber match at No Way <b>Out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> survived to the final two before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Triple H.|$|E

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him <b>out,</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, the storyline {{about the}} call Cane {{received}} from Langley was readdressed, as re-written by Maria Arena Bell. In her {{revised version of}} the storyline, Langley is really Phillip Chancellor III, portrayed by Thom Bierdz. The series kept secrecy around the plot twist by sneaking Bierdz in to tape scenes and asked that he not tell anyone of his return. Goddard liked the plot twist because it added another dimension to Cane, saying that the change would [...] "allow another metamorphosis to begin" [...] and additional [...] "development and evolution of Cane". He also said that Cane {{had always been a}} [...] "three-dimensional character" [...] and [...] "a fourth dimension" [...] would soon be seen because the viewers would finally find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> came from and who he is. Bell later introduced Tristan Rogers as Colin Atkinson and Genie Francis as Genevieve Atkinson, who would portray Cane's biological parents. Goddard stated that Rogers being on the soap opera [...] "created a father/son rapport" [...] for the character, which he thought had [...] "a lot of promise" [...] and was a [...] "wonderful dynamic".|$|E

50|$|Prosser played much of {{his club}} rugby for Pontypool, whom he joined in the late 1950s. At club level he was placed mainly in the second row, but later {{switched}} to the front row during his international career. Prosser was an enthusiastic student of rugby and believed in regular playing and training. His playing style was robust and aggressive, whose work rate in the scrum and mauls was tireless. Prosser was often seen as over-vigorous, if not dirty, in some aspects of his play; especially in line <b>outs</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would sometimes use his arms illegally on his opposite jumper.|$|R

2500|$|The writers {{decided to}} change the book's setting from London to Chicago because they were more {{familiar}} with the city and it also had a [...] "great alternative music scene", according to Pink.

I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them". Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: [...] "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, of course, there is the climate. But everyone, including Nick, felt that geography was not the central issue. It has a universal appeal". Scenes were filmed in the neighborhood of Wicker Park, [...] and on the campus of Lane Tech High School.|$|E

[...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught").|$|E
2500|$|Brian {{identified}} {{the main difference}} between his music approach to the Beatles' is that they simplify songs to their [...] "skeletal form," [...] whereas he would be [...] "impelled to make [...] more complex," [...] and that if he had arranged [...] "Norwegian Wood", he would have [...] "orchestrated it, put in background voices, [...] done a thousand things." [...] On the subject of the Beatles' Revolver (1966), Love responded: [...] "No, I don't think he was influenced by Revolver. Brian was in his own world, believe me. If he were influenced by the Beatles, there'd be more fuzz tone and a few sitars on our records, but there never have been, really." [...] Wilson praised McCartney's bass playing, calling it [...] "technically fantastic, but his harmonies and the psychological thing he brings to the music comes through. Psychologically he is really strong ... The other thing that I could never get was how versatile he was. .... we would spend ages trying to work <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> got all those different types of songs from." [...] In 2014, Brian stated that he thought [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] was [...] "a weird record ... I liked it", although he denied rumors which said that the song had crippled him emotionally. In 2015, he highlighted [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] as a favorite. He views [...] "Let It Be" [...] as an intensely comforting song, likening it to valium.|$|E
2500|$|Eli Wallach as Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez (known as [...] "The Rat" [...] {{according}} to Blondie): The Ugly, a comical and oafish but cagey and resilient, fast-talking Mexican bandit who is wanted {{by the authorities}} for {{a long list of}} crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. The director originally considered Gian Maria Volontè for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with [...] "natural comic talent". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in How the West Was Won (1962), in particular, his performance in [...] "The Railroads" [...] scene. In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was skeptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from For a Few Dollars More, Wallach said: [...] "When do you want me?" [...] The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, [...] "Tuco {{is the only one of}} the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint's and Lee's characters remain mysteries." [...] In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to [...] "The Good , the Ugly , the Bad [...] ".|$|E
