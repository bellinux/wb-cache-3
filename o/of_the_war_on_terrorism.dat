25|$|On 11 December 2001, {{as a part}} of New Zealand's {{contribution}} to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, the NZSAS commenced Operation CONCORD. This deployment saw the NZSAS deploying a Squadron as a component of Task Force K-Bar to perform operations as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terrorism</b> in Afghanistan. The Squadron performed a variety of missions including special reconnaissance, direct action, close personal protection and sensitive site exploitation. Initially special reconnaissance patrols were performed on foot with insertion and extraction being conducted by helicopter in the high-altitude snow-covered areas of southern and central Afghanistan. Three NZSAS patrols were involved in this manner during Operation ANACONDA in March 2002. In May 2002 the focus changed to mounted operations with patrols using modified American Humvees, supported by motorbikes to conduct 'long-range extended-duration patrols'. These patrols would often last 20 to 30 days and cover between 1000 and 2000 kilometres. Three six month 'roulements' of between 40 and 65 soldiers from the NZSAS served in Afghanistan during this time, before the unit returned to New Zealand on 12 December 2002.|$|E

Ojeda Ríos also expressed that despite openly supporting Puerto Rican independence, Castro and Chavéz had avoided adopting radical measures on the matter, arguing that they were most likely being cautious since their involvement in local affair at could justify military intervention by the United States. When discussing the ongoing war in Iraq, he called it [...] "part of a geopolitical strategy for the Middle East" [...] and claimed that it served economic interests, calling it [...] "the most abusive war" [...] since Vietnam. Ojeda Ríos expressed opposition to the military recruitment of students in high schools and lamented the participation of Puerto Ricans in this war. He also supported the anti-war activism of Cindy Sheehan and Sonia Santiago. When discussing the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terrorism,</b> Ojeda Ríos once again cited several acts done by the United States military locally, in Abu Rahub, Guantanamo, Japan and Vietnam as examples of [...] "state terrorism" [...] and criticized CNN for publishing live feeds of the bombings in Iraq [...] "without regard" [...] for those that died as collateral damage.|$|E

In April 2008, the Associated Press reported that US federal agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, were advised to stop using the term Islamo-fascism in a fourteen-point memo issued by the Extremist Messaging Branch, a department of another federal body known as the National Counterterrorism Center.
