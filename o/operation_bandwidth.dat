We practically demonstrate a photonic Hilbert transformer in planar geometry; utilising a pi-phase shift planar Bragg grating with proper apodization profile.

The PHT has a pi-phase shift at the zero point of the frequency response, whereas the amplitude remains constant. The pi-phase shift in PHT is simply induced by placing a pi-phase shift in the refractive index modulation. The constant amplitude is achieved by precise apodization of the grating coupling strength, while the apodization profile is given by [2]. With our current direct UV writing technology, the proposed grating can be fabricated in a much higher accuracy then the conventional fibre Bragg grating manufacturing technique.

Theoretical analysis confirms that a single layer of graphene is optically transparent and it has an absorption of 2.3 % [35 – 37]. To enhance the confinement of the electromagnetic energy, periodical patterned graphene structures have been designed such as net-shaped [20 – 22], anti-dots [23], and cross-shaped [32]. However, these absorbers are deeply dependent on complex structured graphene which result in fabrication difficulty. Moreover, the band available for operation is very narrow, {{and most of the}} works reported do not have bandwidth of more than 1.5  Thz [20 – 28]. In order to broaden the bandwidth, several multilayer graphene structures have been proposed.
