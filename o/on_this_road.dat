5|$|Faversham was {{established}} as a settlement before the Roman conquest. The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham, with traffic through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before heading up Watling Street to London. The town was less than 10 miles from Canterbury, and consequently Faversham had become established <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD. Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham, including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794. In 2013, {{the remains of a}} 2,000-year-old Roman theatre, able to accommodate some 12,000 people, were discovered at a hillside near the town. The cockpit-style outdoor auditorium, {{the first of its kind}} found in Britain, was a style the Romans used elsewhere in their empire on the Continent.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Jones {{surveyed}} Ancaster, Thorold, Grantham, Beverley, Southwold, Whitby, York, Scarboro, Pickering, {{the lands}} of Joseph Brant and Lake Simcoe. On December 24, 1795 Jones was directed by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe to survey and open a cart road from the newly planned settlement of York, Upper Canada to Lake Simcoe. Jones began the planning work the next day. On the 29th of that December, Jones was given the assistance of thirty of the Queen's Rangers for the road's construction. The work began January 4, 1796 <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>road,</b> which would become Yonge Street. Jones worked as the effective master builder {{in addition to his}} title as surveyor. The road reached Holland Landing on February 16, 1796, and Jones returned to York on February 20 to inform the Lieutenant Governor that the road was completed. This first incarnation of Yonge Street measured some 34 miles and 53 chains. For the rest of 1796, Jones spent his time surveying Newark, Flamborough, Grimsby, Saltfleet, Beverley, York and Coot's Paradise.|$|E

500|$|By July 26 {{all three}} battalions of the 24th Infantry were {{concentrated}} in remote battle positions that {{were difficult to}} resupply, astride the road [...] west of Sangju. The shortage of UN troops forced the regiment to devote most of its troops to the front, leaving very few reserves to respond to attacks. Elements of the NK 15th Division advancing <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> had cleared the mountain passes and were closing with the regiment. From July 26 {{to the end of}} the month the North Koreans had almost constant contact with the 24th Infantry, which was supported by the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion. The North Koreans relied heavily on massed charges to close rapidly on the US lines. This caused heavy casualties for the North Koreans, but their mortars and artillery inflicted significant casualties on the American lines in turn.|$|E

The other was located in the Atlantic City area along U.S. Route 30 (Absecon Boulevard) east of current Route 157; the Route 56 designation <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> was dropped in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. [...] What is modern-day Route 56 was originally designated as County Route 22 between Route 77 and the Salem County border, County Route 6 in Salem County, and County Route 23 between the Salem County border and Route 47. In 1977, Route 56 was legislated onto its current alignment between Route 77 in Upper Deerfield Township and Route 47 in Vineland, replacing County Routes 6, 22, and 23. The Route 56 designation was applied to this road by the 1990s.|$|E

SR-68 then turns north before crossing SR-154, commonly known as the Bangerter Highway. Soon reverting to two lanes, the route exits Bluffdale and enters Riverton, gaining two lanes in each direction as it passes SR-71. Continuing north, it enters South Jordan. It intersects with SR-175, SR-151, and SR-209, gaining one more lane in each direction beyond the latter intersection, and enters West Jordan and central Salt Lake County.|$|E
