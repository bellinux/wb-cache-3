A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1; combining the geometric mean ratio of 5:1 with a conservative prevalence estimate for autism of 1.3 per 1,000 suggests indirectly that the prevalence of AS might be around 0.26 per 1,000. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> in estimates arises from differences in diagnostic criteria. For example, a relatively small 2007 study of 5,484 eight-year-old children in Finland found 2.9 children per 1,000 met the ICD-10 criteria for an AS diagnosis, 2.7 per 1,000 for Gillberg and Gillberg criteria, 2.5 for DSM-IV, 1.6 for Szatmari et al., and 4.3 per 1,000 for the union of the four criteria. Boys seem to be more likely to have AS than girls; estimates of the sex ratio range from 1.6:1 to 4:1, using the Gillberg and Gillberg criteria. Females with autism spectrum disorders may be underdiagnosed.|$|E

25|$|Quite often, {{textbook}} {{problems will}} treat the population standard deviation {{as if it}} were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student's t-distribution. These problems are generally of two kinds: (1) those in which the sample size is so large that one may treat a data-based estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> {{as if it were}} certain, and (2) those that illustrate mathematical reasoning, in which the problem of estimating the standard deviation is temporarily ignored because that is not the point that the author or instructor is then explaining.|$|E
25|$|For maximum {{likelihood}} estimations, a model {{may have a}} number of nuisance parameters. For the asymptotic behaviour outlined to hold, the number of nuisance parameters should not increase with the number of observations (the sample size). A well-known example of this case is where observations occur as pairs, where the observations in each pair have a different (unknown) mean but otherwise the observations are independent and normally distributed with a common variance. Here for 2N observations, there are Nnbsp&+nbsp&1 parameters. It is well known that the {{maximum likelihood}} estimate for the variance does not converge to the true value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is {{the method}} that many have argued {{is the most}} accurate. In general, Bayesian statistical methods allow investigators to combine pre-existing information with new hypothesis. In the case of evolution, it combines {{the likelihood of the}} data observed with the likelihood that the events happened in the order they did, while recognizing the potential for error and uncertainty. Overall, it is the most accurate method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, as well as protein stability. Unlike the other two methods, Bayesian inference yields a distribution of possible trees, allowing for more accurate and easily interpretable estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> of possible outcomes.|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to consider that treated and untreated units can differ dramatically in observational studies. In such situations propensity score methods may be ineffective. It is, therefore, important to check the balance between the samples after adjusting for the propensity score. Rubin (2001) proposes three balance measures: the standardized bias, <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propensity scores, and <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covariates after regressing them on the propensity scores. The standardized bias is defined as the difference in means divided by the standard deviation in the treatment group. It can be computed for continuous and binary variables. Ideally, standardized biases should be as small as possible, but values less than 0.25 are considered to be acceptable (Harder et al. 2010; Stuart 2010). However, this is rather a rule of thumb than a strict cut-off value and it is advisable to use regression adjustments to remove the remaining bias (see the next paragraph; Austin 2009). <b>The</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propensity scores and <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> for <b>the</b> residuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covariates after adjusting for the propensity scores should be close to one (e.g. between 0.5 and 2; Rubin 2001).|$|R
