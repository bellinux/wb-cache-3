5|$|One of Hareide's last {{actions in}} office was {{to approve the}} {{construction}} of a hydroelectric power plant in the Hatteberg watershed in Kvinnherad, a protected natural area. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> went to his successor, Helen Bjørnøy, who neglected to roll back the decision when assuming office. She eventually resigned halfway into her term.|$|E
5|$|Since much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> is {{the result}} of photos and videos taken during the hunt and {{slaughter}}, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E
5|$|In light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism,</b> tournament organisers ERC {{agreed to}} review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E

5|$|In mid-January, when Earp ally Rickabaugh {{sold the}} Oriental Saloon to Earp adversary Milt Joyce, Wyatt sold his {{gambling}} concessions at the hotel. The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town. On February 2, 1882, Wyatt and Virgil, tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> leveled against them, submitted their resignations to Dake, {{who refused to}} accept them because their accounts had not been settled. On the same day, Wyatt {{sent a message to}} Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day of the charges against him in the shooting of Virgil Earp, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2010–11 season, James {{embraced the}} villain role that was {{bestowed}} upon {{him by the}} media. He played for the Heat with an angry demeanor and less joy than in years past, and later admitted that he regretted this approach. On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland {{for the first time}} since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting. Miami entered the playoffs as the East's second seed and advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2–1 series lead going into Game 4. James received the brunt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.|$|E

25|$|However, ATSDR {{has also}} {{been the focus of}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress and other groups. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> {{is due to the fact}} that the agency has been overtasked yet understaffed and underfunded for much of its history.|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} for evaluating and mapping criticisms involves three stages. First, a literature review to identify criticisms.

25|$|Cyprian {{had been}} a {{controversial}} figure in his lifetime; and even after his death Pontius {{felt the need to}} react to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> he received. The life takes on a particularly apologetic character in its treatment of Cyprian's election to bishop, which some Carthaginians contested (5, 6) and of Cyprian's decision to go into hiding during the Decian persecution of AD 250, rather than undergo martyrdom (7-8).|$|E
25|$|When the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again {{wrote to}} defend the {{original}} series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers. The extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticism,</b> however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its readers that the series had been subjected to strong criticism. He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the series, but also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Adaptive {{hypermedia}} techniques provide {{users with}} personalisation of contents and links. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> adaptive systems are that users {{do not always}} understand why the system is adapting the content and links [14], and that the adaptation process can lead to prolific or out of place linking. This paper introduces <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a multi-dimensional linkbase to describe a single linkbase containing links annotated with metadata that places them in several different contextual dimensions at once. We also allow users to have control over personalisation by enabling direct manipulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linkbase. We argue that this approach answer some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> adaptive hypermedia. ...|$|R
