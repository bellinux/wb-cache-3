40|$|Currently, five types <b>of</b> {{interstitial}} <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> unknown etiology or IIP {{have been}} described; DAD, UIP, BOOP, DIP and LIP. A {{summary of the}} features of clinical course, prognosis and therapeutic effects to steroid hormone treatment of the five types <b>of</b> interstitial <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> unknown etiology or IIP is given in Table 15. Among the previous mentioned [table] 52 open lung biopsy cases <b>of</b> interstitial <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> unknown etiology or IIP, for which an open lung biopsy was necessary for diagnosis, the majority of those cases (81 %) was IPF (UIP) while idiopathic BOOP occurred as the second in frequency (13 %). These data will help in understanding the clinical outcome and the therapeutic response to steroid hormone treatment in cases <b>of</b> interstitial <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> unknown etiology or IIP, because idopathic UIP is slowly progressive and usually not responsive to steroid while idiopathic BOOP is usually responsive to steroid hormone treatment and may regress even spontaneously.

40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae is an {{important}} cause of respiratory disease in humans, but diagnosis <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> is hindered by difficulties in the in vitro growth of the organism. In order to improve detection and identification, we recently developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay which uses oligonucleotide primers specific for C. pneumoniae. The nucleic acid sequence was determined for the 16 S rRNA <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae,</b> and regions in which C. pneumoniae differed from both Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia trachomatis were identified. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to these unique regions were then synthesized and used in a PCR for the detection <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae.</b> The C. pneumoniae-specific primers permitted the identification of six isolates <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae,</b> but no reaction was observed with the 15 serovars of C. trachomatis or two strains of C. psittaci. PCR should prove to be valuable in confirming the identification <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> and in the diagnosis <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> infections...|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} <b>of</b> Chlamydia <b>pneumoniae</b> in aerosols {{was investigated}} {{by using a}} chamber with a capacity of 114. 5 liters. We injected 5 x 10 (7) inclusion-forming units (IFU) <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> in aerosols with a droplet size of 3 to 5 microns. Samples were taken after 30 s and every 1 min thereafter. The survival <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> was measured at four temperatures (8. 5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and at three different relative humidities (RH) of 5, 50, and 95 % for each temperature. The survival rates <b>of</b> Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae,</b> Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis LGV 2, and cytomegalovirus were also determined at 25 degrees C and 95 % RH and compared with that <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae.</b> At the mentioned temperatures and RH, a rapid decrease <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> IFU was observed in the first 30 s. After this the {{decrease in the number}} of IFU was more gradual. The survival <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> in aerosols were optimal at 15 to 25 degrees C and 95 % RH; it was good compared with those of other microorganisms. A lower death rate was observed only in S. faecalis. In C. trachomatis, the death rate during the first 30 s was higher than that in C. pneumoniae (85 and 53. 3 %, respectively). After the first 30 s, the death rates in the two organisms were identical. It was concluded that transmission <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> via aerosols was possible. There is probably a direct transmission from person to person, taking into account the relatively short survival period <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> in aerosols...|$|R

40|$|Chlamydophila {{pneumonia}} is {{a common}} cause <b>of</b> community-acquired <b>pneumonia</b> throughout the world. It causes mild pneumonia or bronchitis in adolescents and young adults.

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no study has attempted to investigate the prevalence <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia</b> in a closed community in Korea. We compared the in-fection rate <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia</b> among university dormitory residents using the miro-immunofluorescence (MIF) method. Antibody titers of IgG (1 : 32 or more) indicate past infection <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia.</b> A recent infection was defined as serum with a high titer of IgG (1 : 512 or more) or a positive IgM (1 : 16 or more). The past infection rate <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia</b> among the university dormitory residents was 71. 7 %. The recent infection rate <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia</b> according to IgG and IgM titers was 28. 3 % and 23. 3 %, respectively. The past infection positive rate according to the number of residence months was 1 month (50 %), 7 months (71. 4 %), 13 months (66. 7 %), and 35 months (89. 5 %). The recent infection pos-itive rate according to IgG antibody titers was 1 month (50 %), 7 months (28. 6 %), 13 months (33. 3 %), and 35 months (10. 5 %). The recent infection rate <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumonia</b> according to IgM antibody titers was 1 month (41. 7 %), 7 months (28. 6 %), 13 months (26. 7 %), and 35 months (5. 3 %).

40|$|Since steroids are {{powerful}} anti-inflammatory agents and increase susceptibility {{to a variety}} of infections, including Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae respiratory tract infections, the effect of the steroid receptor antagonist RU 486 (mifepristone) on C. pneumoniae growth in epithelial HEp- 2 cells was examined. Treatment of HEp- 2 cells with RU 486 significantly inhibited the growth <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Electron microscopic studies also revealed that the treatment of infected cells with RU 486 resulted in a marked destruction of infecting organisms. The addition of the host cell protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to the infected cells did not alter the inhibition <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> growth by RU 486. Pretreatment <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> organisms with RU 486 before addition to culture also did not result in any modulation of bacterial growth in the cells. However, the binding of RU 486 to C. pneumoniae organisms in cells at 24 h after infection was demonstrated by immune electron microscopy with anti-RU 486 antibody. Incubation of cells with anti-RU 486 antibody completely diminished the inhibition <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> growth by RU 486. These results indicate that RU 486 may directly bind to the bacteria within cells and cause the destruction <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae.</b> This novel mode of regulation <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> growth in cells by RU 486 might provide a new approach to understanding complicated aspects <b>of</b> C. <b>pneumoniae</b> infection...|$|R
