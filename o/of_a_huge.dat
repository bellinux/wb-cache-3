5|$|Although still young, Henry was {{increasingly}} gaining {{a reputation as}} an energetic and capable leader. His prestige and power increased further when he unexpectedly married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152; Eleanor was the attractive Duchess of Aquitaine and the recently divorced wife of Louis VII of France, and the marriage made Henry the future ruler <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> swathe of territory across France.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia at the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, {{who had participated in}} the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E
5|$|Sheesh Mahal is flanked {{on either}} side by the Raja Mahal and the Jahangir Mahal. This has royal accommodation, which was built for king Udait Singh. It has now been {{converted}} into a hotel. The interior of this edifice consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> impressive hall with high ceiling, which is the dining hall. Its recent colour scheme renovations are an eyesore. But staying in two of its royal suites on the upper floor, which provide scenic views of the town, gives the guest a feeling of royalty.|$|E

5|$|The {{legend of}} Sharabha as an {{incarnation}} of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one’s religious beliefs. But one common refrain {{in all these}} depictions is that Sharabha is a combination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested {{with the purpose of}} pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as Narasimha (man-lion) or Varaha (the boar).|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder is shown {{evidence}} of alien life which may actually be part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> government hoax designed to deflect attention from secret military programs. Meanwhile, Scully struggles with her cancer {{in the face of}} hostility from her brother, who believes she should no longer be working.|$|E
5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves in the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal {{on the assumption that}} it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E

5|$|Constantinople was {{the nerve}} {{centre of the}} Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's {{remaining}} provinces would have been unlikely to hold together, and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, {{the failure of the}} Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's prestige. Conversely, Byzantine prestige reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|Cretan piracy reached another {{high in the}} 930s and 940s, devastating {{southern}} Greece, Athos, and {{the western}} coasts of Asia Minor. As a result, Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent another expedition in 949. This too was routed in a surprise attack, a defeat which Byzantine chroniclers ascribe to the incompetence and inexperience of its leader, the eunuch chamberlain Constantine Gongyles. Constantine VII did not give up, and during {{the last years of}} his reign he began preparing another expedition. It would be carried out under his successor, Romanos II (r. 959–963), who entrusted its leadership to the capable general Nikephoros Phokas. At the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fleet and army, Phokas sailed in June or July 960, landed on the island, and defeated the initial Muslim resistance. A long siege of Chandax followed, which dragged over the winter into 961, when the city was stormed on 6 March.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E

5|$|Leeds Parish Church, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1841 {{after an}} {{elaborate}} ceremony, was of almost cathedral size, the centre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> parish ministered by many curates. Lang's district was the Kirkgate, {{one of the}} poorest areas, many of whose 2,000inhabitants were prostitutes. Lang and his fellow curates fashioned a clergy house from a derelict public house. He later moved next door, into a condemned property which became his home for his remaining service in Leeds. In addition to his normal parish duties, Lang acted temporarily as Principal of the Clergy School, was chaplain to Leeds Infirmary, and took charge of a men's club of around a hundred members. On 24 May 1891 he was ordained to full priesthood.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in Buenos Aires. Pueyrredón initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos and the organization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza {{with his wife and}} daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Sometime around 1285, Braose {{confirmed}} {{grants of}} land by his ancestors {{to the religious}} house of Sele Priory. In 1286 Braose was in the king's service, for unspecified duties overseas. It is possible that these included accompanying the king, Edward I, to Paris where Edward performed homage to the new French king, Philip IV, for Edward's French lands. Braose {{played a significant role}} in King Edward's Welsh wars. In the winter of 1287–8 he commanded the force blockading Emlyn castle. His men also provided the escort for the transport <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> siege engine from Dryslwyn to Emlyn. The arrival of the engine, with 480 great stones as ammunition, persuaded the defenders of the castle to surrender peaceably.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

Up to 65 species of fruit {{have been reported in}} their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, Thomas E. Gilliard found papayas growing at the base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing {{in that part of the}} forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting.|$|E
