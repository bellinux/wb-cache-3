25|$|In the United States {{physicians}} holding certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) {{have successfully}} completed an accredited educational program and evaluation process, including a proctored examination to demonstrate knowledge, skills, {{and experience in}} patient care in allergy and immunology. Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training. After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training {{in one of these}} specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP), the American Board <b>of</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Medicine</b> (ABIM), or the American Osteopathic Board <b>of</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Medicine</b> (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the ABAI following their fellowship.|$|E
