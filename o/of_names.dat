5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin {{the naming}} of {{tropical}} cyclones started in 1960, with four sets of female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> had been used, {{it was decided to}} return {{to the top of the}} second list and to start recycling the sets <b>of</b> <b>names</b> on an annual basis. In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> The WMO selected six lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> have been used, with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the change <b>of</b> <b>named</b> {{entities}} over time and its influence on the performance <b>of</b> the <b>named</b> entity tagger. First, we analyze Japanese named enti-ties which appear in Mainichi Newspaper articles published in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2005. This analysis reveals that the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types and the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity tokens are almost steady over time and that 70 ∼ 80 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types in a certain year occur in the articles published either in its succeeding year or in its preceding year. These facts lead that 20 ∼ 30 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> entity types are replaced with new ones every year. The experiment against these texts shows that our propos-ing semi-supervised method which com-bines a small annotated corpus and a large unannotated corpus for training works ro-bustly although the traditional supervised method is fragile against the change <b>of</b> <b>name</b> entity distribution. ...|$|R
5|$|At the 22nd {{hurricane}} {{committee in}} 2000 {{it was decided}} that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed. Ahead of the 2000–01 season it was decided to start using male names, as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the South-West Indian Ocean. RSMC La Reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean during September 2001, that the basin adopt a single circular list <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Along with the RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee, RSMC La Reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only one name during its lifetime. However, both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual list <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and to rename systems when they moved across 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean. During the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season the naming of subtropical cyclones restarted, with names assigned to systems from the main list <b>of</b> <b>names</b> drawn up for that year.|$|E
5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed in {{principle}} to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list <b>of</b> <b>names,</b> as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists <b>of</b> <b>names</b> that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E

6000|$|To {{handle this}} a little, and to shew {{you what the}} apostle here means by <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Christ: he meaneth not an irreligious <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> that worthy <b>name,</b> nor those that name it irreligiously.

5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection <b>of</b> <b>names</b> for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike <b>of</b> <b>names</b> or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
