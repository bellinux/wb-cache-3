5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate <b>outward</b> at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to <b>outward</b> and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends <b>outward</b> {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating <b>outward</b> from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the <b>outward</b> drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered <b>outward</b> by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|A typical keep {{would have}} {{between three and}} seven stories {{discernible}} from the outside. Its inner structure including the number of floors could differ from the <b>outward</b> appearance. Castle towers at Himeji, Inuyama, Matsue and Matsumoto Castle have one floor more than is visible from the outside.|$|E
5|$|As a simple, visible surface polyhedron, the <b>outward</b> form of {{the final}} stellation is {{composed}} of 180 triangular faces, which are the outermost triangular regions in the stellation diagram. These join along 270 edges, which in turn meet at 92 vertices, with an Euler characteristic of 2.|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened <b>outward,</b> and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the explosive bolts used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single <b>outward</b> {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|From the corona, {{a stellar}} wind of plasma {{particles}} expands <b>outward</b> from the star, until it {{interacts with the}} interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move <b>outward</b> during the shadow pass creating an <b>outward</b> extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E
5|$|In November 1945, at the {{recommendation}} of the planning board, in an effort to improve traffic flow <b>outward</b> from the downtown core, city council initiated what would {{come to be known as}} the Clifton Road Extension.|$|E
5|$|London annexed {{many of the}} {{surrounding}} communities in 1961, including Byron and Masonville, adding 60,000 people and more than doubling its area. After this amalgamation, suburban growth accelerated as London grew <b>outward</b> in all directions, creating expansive new subdivisions such as Westmount, Oakridge, Whitehills, Pond Mills, White Oaks and Stoneybrook.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to be scattered <b>outward</b> onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander <b>outward</b> as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded <b>outward</b> toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered <b>outward</b> again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} {{is the idea that}} tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower atmospheric pressure {{at the center of a}} tornado, which causes the house to explode <b>outward.</b> As the theory goes, opening windows helps to equalize the pressure.|$|E
5|$|Production of the La-7 {{amounted}} to 5,753 aircraft, plus 584 La-7UTI trainers. Those aircraft still in service {{after the end}} of the war were given the NATO reporting name Fin. The follow-up model, the La-9, despite its <b>outward</b> similarity, was a completely new design.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow <b>outward,</b> creating the reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|The Spectrum {{is based}} on a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3.5MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The {{original}} model has 16KB (16×1024 bytes) of ROM and either 16KB or 48KB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the <b>outward</b> appearance was designed by Sinclair's industrial designer Rick Dickinson.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior <b>outward</b> via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy <b>outward</b> towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat <b>outward</b> to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} {{considered part of the}} Kuiper belt, are also thought to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than <b>outward.</b> The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|The corona is the {{extended}} {{atmosphere of the}} Sun, which has a volume {{much larger than the}} volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma <b>outward</b> from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Ivan in the Lesser Antilles and South America in September 2004 {{included}} 44deaths and over $1billion in damage (2004USD), primarily in Grenada {{where it was}} considered the worst hurricane in nearly 50years. Hurricane Ivan developed from a tropical wave on September 2 and rapidly intensified to become a major hurricane, passing through the southern Lesser Antilles on September 7 with winds of 125mph (205km/h). At the time, its typical storm force winds extended <b>outward</b> up to 160miles (260km) with hurricane-force winds <b>outward</b> to 70miles (110km), and the northern portion of the eye passed over Grenada.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outward</b> {{appearance}} of the Zytglogge {{is determined by the}} 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000km from {{the centre of}} Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000km. A faint <b>outward</b> {{extension}} to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000km.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced <b>outward,</b> secondaries inward, and the tail from centre <b>outward.</b> Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral <b>outward.</b> The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated <b>outward</b> from the camp.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated <b>outward,</b> unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its <b>outward</b> similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and <b>outward.</b> The area had a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Nice model, objects are captured into resonances with Neptune during its <b>outward</b> migration. Some remain in the resonances, others evolve onto higher-inclination, lower-eccentricity orbits, and are released onto stable orbits forming the dynamically hot classical belt. The hot belt's inclination distribution can be reproduced if Neptune migrated from 24 AU to 30 AU on a 30 Myr timescale. When Neptune migrates to 28 AU, it has a gravitational encounter with the extra ice giant. Objects captured from the cold belt into the 1:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune are left behind as a local concentration at 44 AU when this encounter causes Neptune's semi-major axis to jump <b>outward.</b> The objects deposited in the cold belt include some loosely bound 'blue' binaries originating from closer than the cold belt's current location. If Neptune's eccentricity remains small during this encounter, the chaotic evolution of orbits of {{the original}} Nice model is avoided and a primordial cold belt is preserved. In the later phases of Neptune's migration, a slow sweeping of mean-motion resonances removes the higher-eccentricity objects from the cold belt, truncating its eccentricity distribution.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it <b>outward</b> until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Belle is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming {{daughter of an}} inventor. Belle yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly <b>outward</b> appearance.|$|E
5|$|Built {{from its}} {{earliest}} nucleus <b>outward,</b> and having escaped {{much of the}} destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Kraków's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Kraków {{is one of the}} few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic Ratusz town hall in its Main Square, because it has not survived the Partitions of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900. The <b>outward</b> transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now a garden.|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is the <b>outward</b> rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} {{exposes the}} eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates <b>outward.</b> The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E
