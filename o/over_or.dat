5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built <b>over</b> <b>or</b> the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing <b>over</b> <b>or</b> passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E

By early on August7, the tropical storm warning was extended to include Kauai, placing all of the main Hawaiian islands under some form of tropical cyclone warning.

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending <b>over</b> <b>or</b> lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
