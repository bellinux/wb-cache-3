50|$|A {{computer}} simulation study {{to plan the}} economic development of the Nile was directed by H. A. W. Morrice and W. N. Allan, for the Ministry of Hydro-power of the Republic of the Sudan, during 1955-1957 Morrice was their Hydrological Adviser, and Allan his predecessor. M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle {{was the use of}} <b>over-year</b> <b>storage,</b> to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water {{as a function of the}} month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on hydrology transport models, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.|$|E
40|$|Long {{hydrological}} records, {{from the}} Amazon Basin, northeastern Brazil, and northwestern Peru spanning {{most of this}} century, are examined for trends in rainfall (three wettest months) and runoff (three months of highest flow) or stage, where no rating curves exist. Trends are tested for significance using the Mann-Kendall statistic. In basins where large soil, aquifer, or man-made reservoirs give rise to appreciable <b>over-year</b> <b>storage,</b> flows and water levels may be serially correlated. Where serial correlation exists, the usual statistical tests (linear regression, t-test, and Mann-Kendall) will overestimate the significance of trends, showing significance where none exists. Analysis for trend therefore requires particular care when data are serially correlated, and to avoid misleading results, additional supportive evidence must be sought. For example, rainfall records within the same river basin can be checked for trends; serial correlation in rainfall records, in particular, {{is less likely to}} be present, so the validity of any trends in rainfall is less open to question. Strong negative trends were found in flow data from the coast of northern Peru and the Sao Francisco River, while positive significant trends were detected in the Parnaiba River basin. No significant trends were found in the discharge or stage records from Amazonia, while rainfall in northeastern Brazil shows a slow increase over long periods. In the Parnaiba and in some rivers of northern Peru unusually large discharges at the beginning or end of the records seem to account for the direction and significance of trends.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{workshop}} was to discuss, compare and evaluate various methods of operating, and determining operating policies for multi-purpose, multiple reservoir systems. While total reservoir capacities are known, the allocation of various storage volume zones within the reservoirs to various purposes, such as water supply or flood control, may vary in time and be dependent on reservoir operating policy. In the guidelines for preparation of the papers included in this volume, it was stressed that discussion should cover reservoir operation for all possible hydrological situations, i. e., in periods of flood, normal flow, and drought conditions. The importance of procedures used to determine when an extreme situation (such as drought), begins and ends, was emphasized, especially with respect to possible changes in reservoir operation. The participants were requested to discuss how operating policies might differ, {{depending on whether the}} reservoirs are in series or are parallel. Also, they were requested to distinguish between operation of "large" <b>over-year</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs and "small" within-year storage reservoirs. If short-term hydrological forecasting and real-time control models were to be used, the workshop discussion would consider how these could be used together with long-term operating policies. Some 30 participants from 13 countries presented 17 papers at the workshop, all of which are included in these proceedings. The first nine provide an overview of how multiple reservoir systems are operated in certain countries. The remaining papers report in more detail on diverse case studies and provide discussion of some specific issues related to the subject of the workshop...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{investigated}} {{the origin of}} the seemingly perennial (base) flow in a hydrological complex, Inselberg (a type of mountain) dominated catchment in the Municipality of Messica, Manica Province, Mozambique. Smallholders rely on these perennial flows, since they have three growth seasons, two of them during the dry period. This year-round agriculture is of pivotal importance for dwellers’ (economical) situation and contributes significantly to Mozambique’s food supply. However, there are many (hydrological) unknowns. How much groundwater is stored where, and how much water can be expected during the growth season. More knowledge will improve plant and irrigation schemes, minimize losses and prevent over-exploitation. The Messica Irrigation Pilot Project (MIPP) searches for hydrological answers and tries to provide practical and theoretical insights. Therefore, students performed measurements (e. g., precipitation, water levels, discharges, cross-sections) in the 220 km 2 large Messica Catchment since December 2012 up to August 2014. Most measurements have been performed at Godi Downstream (a headwater from the mountainous ridge). This perennial stream is small and abundantly vegetated. Another important measurement point is a free flow three-gated bridge downstream in the River Messica. Unfortunately, limited measurements are done here. Overall, the entire Messica Catchment is parsimoniously measured. Scientists also strive to improve ’Prediction in Ungauged Basins’ (PUB). This research took place in recent years. (Parts of) its knowledge and insights are used in this study. This master thesis continued on earlier theses, together they contribute to MIPP’s initiatives on three points. With this insights and practical methods, one might predict headwater baseflow one to two growth seasons ahead. This study proposes (1) the ’conveyance method’ to predict baseflow recession using cross-sectional corrected water levels (conveyances). Conveyances are measured continuously and are obtained directly, as opposed to discharge measurements. This method is based on uniform flow and linear (groundwater) reservoir assumptions together with a known cross-section. The conveyances C and discharges Q are linear related. The bottomslope and roughness are combined in one constant a. From this, we derived groundwater response timescales Ks, and hence, estimated the baseflow recession. Godi’s recession timescale is about 550 days. Together with some additional discharge measurements we are able to calculate discharges two growth seasons ahead. Inselbergs are very steep mountains, ridges or isolated hills in gently sloped areas. They are omnipresent in the Manica province, just as in other parts of East and West Africa. Normally they consist of solid, barely erodible TTG (Tonalite, Trondhjemite, or Granites) materials, as it is the case for the Kalahari Craton, where Messica is located on. Just East of Messica, the Kalahari borders the Barue Complex. Water storage in these solid Inselbergs is not obvious. However, literature study showed that Messica’s mountain ridge belongs to the later deposed Gairezi Sedimentary Group on top of the Kalahari Craton. It forms a 220 km long belt from Sussendenga in the South to Guru in the North. The Gairezi consists of quartszites and metapelic schists, with internal westward-dipping inclinations. These mountains contain internal cracks and fissures, where water storage can take place. We developed two Flexible Topography driven, conceptual rainfall runoff (FlexTopo) models (FlexA and FlexC) with an additional output conversion model (OCM) to calibrate on conveyances. FlexA serves as a lumped benchmark model which incorporates all the predefined relevant hydrological processes. FlexC is semi-distributed and distinguishes three different HRUs (hydrological response units), which are entities that show similar hydrological responses. We use two objective parameters to classify the area: Head Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) (as function of the flow accumulation) and hill slope values. FlexC’s HRUs are: Wetlands (with saturated overland flow and exfiltration of deeper groundwater), Inselbergs (with perennial baseflow from its large groundwater storages, fast runoff processes due to steep, forested and/or rocky slopes) and Flatlands. The latter covers a wider scope from irrigated areas, grass and shrub lands to rain-fed fields, but contributes also (delayed) to base and peak flows. Every HRU has its own slow groundwater response reservoir. Furthermore, we applied altitude corrected precipitation to correct for orographic effects. Both FlexA and FlexC are calibrated on the River Godi and validated on the RiverMessica. FlexC showed that (2) Messica’s Inselberg ridge most likely contains an <b>over-year</b> <b>storage.</b> It predicted a groundwater storage of about 800 mm in 2013 - 2014. This led to a specific discharge q of 1. 45 mm/s {{at the beginning of the}} dry period. In general, this storage guarantees a continuous streamflow during the dry season and makes the area more resilient for dry years. Moreover, we showed with FlexA and FlexC that (3) conveyances can be used to calibrate year-round discharge variations (both base and peak flows). It also proved that FlexModels are transferable, i. e. discharge variations for the (ungauged) downstream locations (Messica Downstream Station) can be predicted based on calibration on a (gauged) subcatchment (Godi Downstream Station). Where FlexA showed better peak flow predictions according to objective functions, FlexC narrowed down uncertainty intervals around predictions on other locations and gave a more consistent model performance. Given the smaller uncertainty intervals, the landscape dependent FlexC is better transferable than the lumped FlexA. However, FlexC seemed to overestimate peak flows, for which several explanations and improvements are given. In general, the conveyance method appeared accurate to predict baseflow recession and to calibrate on low flows. It performed less well during peak flows, since the uniform flow assumption was violated. This was mostly due to the abundant (water) vegetation. The vegetation was even denser above the average water level. Additional work is needed in order to make the method fully functional for the whole flow regime.

40|$|Most of {{the real}} world {{problems}} in water resources involve nonlinear formulations in their solution construction. Obtaining optimal solutions for large scale nonlinear optimization problems is always a challenging task. The conventional methods, such as linear programming (LP), dynamic programming (DP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) may often face problems in solving them. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in biologically motivated adaptive systems for solving real world optimization problems. The multi-member, stochastic approach followed in Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) makes them less susceptible to getting trapped at local optimal solutions, and they can search easier for global optimal solutions. In this thesis, efficient optimization techniques based on swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation principles have been proposed for single and multi-objective optimization in water resource systems. To overcome the inherent limitations of conventional optimization techniques, meta-heuristic techniques like ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) approaches are developed for single and multi-objective optimization. These methods are then applied to few case studies in planning and operation of reservoir systems in India. First a methodology based on ant colony optimization (ACO) principles is investigated for reservoir operation. The utility of the ACO technique for obtaining optimal solutions is explored for large scale nonlinear optimization problems, by solving a reservoir operation problem for monthly operation over a long-time horizon of 36 years. It is found that this methodology relaxes the <b>over-year</b> <b>storage</b> constraints and provides efficient operating policy that can be implemented {{over a long period of}} time. By using ACO technique for reservoir operation problems, some of the limitations of traditional nonlinear optimization methods are surmounted and thus the performance of the reservoir system is improved. To achieve faster optimization in water resource systems, a novel technique based on swarm intelligence, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been proposed. In general, PSO has distinctly faster convergence towards global optimal solutions for numerical optimization. However, it is found that the technique has the problem of getting trapped to local optima while solving real world complex problems. To overcome such drawbacks, the standard particle swarm optimization technique has been further improved by incorporating a novel elitist-mutation (EM) mechanism into the algorithm. This strategy provides proper exploration and exploitation throughout the iterations. The improvement is demonstrated by applying it to a multi-purpose single reservoir problem and also to a multi reservoir system. The results showed robust performance of the EM-PSO approach in yielding global optimal solutions. Most of the practical problems in water resources are not only nonlinear in their formulations but are also multi-objective in nature. For multi-objective optimization, generating feasible efficient Pareto-optimal solutions is always a complicated task. In the past, many attempts with various conventional approaches were made to solve water resources problems and some of them are reported as successful. However, in using the conventional linear programming (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods, they usually involve essential approximations, especially while dealing withdiscontinuous, non-differentiable, non-convex and multi-objective functions. Most of these methods consider multiple objective functions using weighted approach or constrained approach without considering all the objectives simultaneously. Also, the conventional approaches use a point-by-point search approach, in which the outcome of these methods is a single optimal solution. So they may require a large number of simulation runs to arrive at a good Pareto optimal front. One of the major goals in multi-objective optimization is to find a set of well distributed optimal solutions along the true Pareto optimal front. The classical optimization methods often fail to attain a good and true Pareto optimal front due to accretion of the above problems. To overcome such drawbacks of the classical methods, there has recently been an increasing interest in evolutionary computation methods for solving real world multi-objective problems. In this thesis, some novel approaches for multi-objective optimization are developed based on swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation principles. By incorporating Pareto optimality principles into particle swarm optimization algorithm, a novel approach for multi-objective optimization has been developed. To obtain efficient Pareto-frontiers, along with proper selection scheme and diversity preserving mechanisms, an efficient elitist mutation strategy is proposed. The developed elitist-mutated multi-objective particle swarm optimization (EM-MOPSO) technique is tested for various numerical test problems and engineering design problems. It is found that the EM-MOPSO algorithm resulting in improved performance over a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The utility of EM-MOPSO technique for water resources optimization is demonstrated through application to a case study, to obtain optimal trade-off solutions to a reservoir operation problem. Through multi-objective analysis for reservoir operation policies, it is found that the technique can offer wide range of efficient alternatives along with flexibility to the decision maker. In general, most of the water resources optimization problems involve interdependence relations among the various decision variables. By using differential evolution (DE) scheme, which has a proven ability of effective handling of this kind of interdependence relationships, an efficient multi-objective solver, namely multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) is proposed. The single objective differential evolution algorithm is extended to multi-objective optimization by integrating various operators like, Pareto-optimality, non-dominated sorting, an efficient selection strategy, crowding distance operator for maintaining diversity, an external elite archive for storing non- dominated solutions and an effective constraint handling scheme. First, different variations of DE approaches for multi-objective optimization are evaluated through several benchmark test problems for numerical optimization. The developed MODE algorithm showed improved performance over a standard MOEA, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm–II (NSGA-II). Then MODE is applied to a case study of Hirakud reservoir operation problem to derive operational tradeoffs in the reservoir system optimization. It is found that MODE is achieving robust performance in evaluation for the water resources problem, and that the interdependence relationships among the decision variables can be effectively modeled using differential evolution operators. For optimal utilization of scarce water resources, an integrated operational model is developed for reservoir operation for irrigation of multiple crops. The model integrates the dynamics associated with the water released from a reservoir to the actual water utilized by the crops at farm level. It also takes into account the non-linear relationship of root growth, soil heterogeneity, soil moisture dynamics for multiple crops and yield response to water deficit at various growth stages of the crops. Two types of objective functions are evaluated for the model by applying to a case study of Malaprabha reservoir project. It is found that both the cropping area and economic benefits from the crops need to be accounted for in the objective function. In this connection, a multi-objective frame work is developed and solved using the MODE algorithm to derive simultaneous policies for irrigation cropping pattern and reservoir operation. It is found that the proposed frame work can provide effective and flexible policies for decision maker aiming at maximization of overall benefits from the irrigation system. For efficient management of water resources projects, there is always a great necessity to accurately forecast the hydrologic variables. To handle uncertain behavior of hydrologic variables, soft computing based artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) models are proposed for reservoir inflow forecasting. The forecast models are developed using large scale climate inputs like indices of El-Nino Southern Oscialltion (ENSO), past information on rainfall in the catchment area and inflows into the reservoir. In this purpose, back propagation neural network (BPNN), hybrid particle swarm optimization trained neural network (PSONN) and adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models have been developed. The developed models are applied for forecasting inflows into the Malaprabha reservoir. The performances of these models are evaluated using standard performance measures and it is found that the hybrid PSONN model is performing better than BPNN and ANFIS models. Finally by adopting PSONN model for inflow forecasting and EMPSO technique for solving the reservoir operation model, the practical utility of the different models developed in the thesis are demonstrated through application to a real time reservoir operation problem. The developed methodologies can certainly help in better planning and operation of the scarce water resources...|$|E
