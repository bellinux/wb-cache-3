5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's <b>operating</b> <b>procedures,</b> in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention. Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> when breathing increased pressures of oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) {{was formed}} at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of {{military}} test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground instruction at Dunsford {{prior to a}} three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight <b>operating</b> <b>procedures,</b> perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.|$|E
5|$|St. Lucia and Dominica {{activated}} their Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) response {{systems to}} help assess and correct the storm's damages. CDERA acknowledged their requests and, based on preliminary damage assessments, initiated a Level Two response which {{allowed for the}} event to be managed at the country level with regional assistance limited to technical support and resources where required. Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada also activated their CDERA response systems. Although they were not directly affected by the hurricane they used the opportunity to test the systems' <b>operating</b> <b>procedures.</b> The other affected islands of the Lesser Antilles, Martinique and Guadeloupe, are not members of CDERA.|$|E
5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1947 {{nationalisation}} of Britain's railways, {{the use of}} {{the railway}} to transport coffins to Brookwood went into steep decline. New <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans, coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for {{the last part of the}} journey, or a special train had to be chartered. The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979, and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether. Since Mountbatten, the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp, carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had {{shortcomings}} in its training procedures, {{in part because it}} lacked a Dash 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly skipped. The commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted shortcomings in the training and <b>operating</b> <b>procedures.</b> All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and callouts.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 MIGA paid {{its first}} {{insurance}} claim since the agency's founding. In 2001 MIGA's issuance of new investment guarantees grew to $2billion. The agency launched its Small Investment Program in 2005 {{in an effort}} to promote investment among small and medium enterprises. That same year, MIGA set up its Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility {{in an effort to}} promote FDI into Afghanistan. In 2007 MIGA issued investment guarantees for a Djibouti port, marking its first support in the form of Islamic finance. The agency also launched PRI-Center.com (now no longer active) as a portal for information on political risk management and investment insurance, which also contained its FDI information services. In 2009, the Board of Directors enacted changes to MIGA's <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> and authorized coverage for default of sovereign financial obligations. The agency also launched an annual publication titled World Investment and Political Risk which reports on trends in worldwide investment and corporate perceptions of prospects and risk, as well as shifts in the political risk insurance industry.|$|E

5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedures,</b> future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E
