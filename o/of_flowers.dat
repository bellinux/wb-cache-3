5|$|Flower {{production}} {{is related to}} increasing day length, and in general, plants produced the most flowers from December to March. Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be ways to increase production <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> outside these months.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} <b>of</b> <b>flowers</b> {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups <b>of</b> <b>flowers,</b> changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E

40|$|Phenology <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> is an {{important}} aspect in the growth cycle of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) because the performance <b>of</b> plant especially <b>flowering</b> is linked with anthesis time, time and duration of stigma receptivity, fruit formation, crossing, and seed development which determine the plant breeding programs. Research was conducted at the Kaliwining experimental station of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI). The cocoa plant was originated from top grafting seedling with the age of eight years. Design of experiment was randomized complete block design consisted of eight clones as treatment with three replications. Each plot consisted <b>of</b> 20 sample <b>flowers.</b> The parameters observed were phenology <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> and pod maturity. Phenology <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> observed were age <b>of</b> <b>flowering,</b> number <b>of</b> opened <b>flower</b> buds, number <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> buds that dropped before being opened, number <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> buds that dropped after being opened, and number <b>of</b> opening <b>flowers</b> that developed into tiny fruits. Observation on pod and been quality was done on pod size, pod weight, pod length, pod girth, and bean number. The result of experiment showed that difference in phenologyof <b>flowering</b> and age <b>of</b> pod maturity existed within eight cocoa clones tested. KKM 22 showed the shortest flowering age and pod maturity, and lowest number of beans. The highest success of pollination was observed on Sca 6 and KW 617. ICCRI 03, Sulawesi 03, ICCRI 07, KKM 22 and KW 617 showed relative low success of pollination, that iswas between 10 to 17. 6 %. Age <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> opening did not significantly influence age of pod maturity, {{on the other hand}} it did not negatively influence percentage <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> opening and percentage <b>of</b> pollinated <b>flowers.</b> The characteristic <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> age had high genetic coefficient of variation as well as high estimated value of heritability. Percentage number <b>of</b> <b>flower</b> buds that dropped before open showed high genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variation, however the estimated heritability was grouped in low category.

5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example.

40|$|Flowering and {{successful}} pollination in wheat are key determinants of both {{quantity and quality}} of grain. Bread wheat line ?Paragon?, introgressed with single or multiple day length insensitivity alleles was used to dissect the effects on the timing and duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> within a hierarchical plant architecture. <b>Flowering</b> <b>of</b> wheat plants was observed in a series of pot-based and field experiments. Ppd-D 1 a was the most potent known allele affecting the timing <b>of</b> <b>flowering,</b> requiring the least thermal time to flowering across all experiments. The duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> for individual lines was dominated by the shift in the start <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> in later tillers and the number of tillers per plant, rather than variation in <b>flowering</b> duration <b>of</b> individual spikes. There was a strong relationship between flowering duration and the start <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> with the earliest lines flowering for the longest. The greatest flowering overlap between tillers was recorded for the Ppd- 1 b. Across all lines, a warmer environment significantly reduced the duration <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> and the influence of Ppd- 1 a alleles on the start <b>of</b> <b>flowering.</b> These findings provide evidence of pleiotropic effects of the Ppd- 1 a alleles, and have direct implications for breeding for increased stress resilient wheat varieties.

He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community.
