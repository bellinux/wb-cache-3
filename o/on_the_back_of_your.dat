Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine, in {{his review}} of the album, wrote: [...] "The fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist'... a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every hair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck." [...] Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: [...] "The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case." [...] Ian Watson of NME wrote: [...] "'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers." ...|$|E

Grace remarked on the possible implications of Franchitti's success on the promotion of CART in the United Kingdom: [...] "If that doesn't sell this sport to Britain then I don't know what will." [...] Mike Nicks in The Observer called Franchitti's win [...] "the greatest of his career", while Jim McGill of Scotland on Sunday noted that while Formula One was promoted as the fastest and most glamorous motorsport, Franchitti's victory helped CART show it could deliver the most drama. The Stamford Mercury & Citizen said {{the sound of the}} cars at the circuit was [...] "one of those sporting moments which stand up the hairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{gave the}} game a perfect score, {{and said the}} {{graphics}} were of [...] "3-D perfection" [...] and the controls and game mechanics [...] "rival those of any GCN racing game". Double Dash also received a perfect score from GamePro, who commented that the gameplay remains [...] "fast and furious". The feature of having two riders per kart was praised by Justin Leeper and Andy McNamara of Game Informer; McNamara stated: [...] "Giving the player control of two different characters is pretty cool in single-player, but add a friend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kart in multiplayer and it opens the game up like never before." [...] GameSpy called Double Dash!! a [...] "great-looking, great-playing game that most gamers will instantly warm to." [...] Eurogamer thought the game {{was one of the}} [...] "finest pieces of electronic entertainment ever developed." [...] GameZone's Louis Bedigian felt that none of the racing games he had played for the GameCube were as [...] "spectacular" [...] as Double Dash!!. GMRs Andrew Pfister said, [...] "Mario Kart: Double Dash is the most fun you'll have with a game this year. And probably next year. And maybe even the year after that". Brett Elston of GamesRadar praised the game's [...] "dual-riders idea and untouchable multiplayer". Electronic Gaming Monthly said that the game's [...] "pure, exhilarating glee will envelop your soul".|$|E

500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every hair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing a live Garbage performance, Jon Parales of The New York Times commented, [...] "Temptress, lover, sufferer, {{scrapper}} – {{those have}} been Ms. Manson's personae since Garbage started in 1995. In other eras {{she might have been}} a pop torch singer, a soul belter or a new-wave frontwoman: a Shirley Bassey, a Dusty Springfield, or a Chrissie Hynde. There's a little of each of them in her voice" [...] also stating [...] "In the course of each song she let her voice rise in anger, contempt or passion". Jen Crothers of Green Left Weekly, in a review of Garbage, remarked that [...] "Manson, vocalist and guitarist, has a powerful voice, which soars and dips like a bird. It can plead or demand. It can sound dreamy or psychotic." [...] Reviewing a 2012 live Garbage performance, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph noted that Manson [...] "remains a striking performer whose distinctive contralto snarl can still raise the hairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck." [...] In a review of Garbage, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Manson's voice as [...] "thin and airy", whilst Mike Diver of the BBC stated Manson owned [...] "a snarl in her voice but [...] equally capable of a purr to melt away any resistance." [...] also adding [...] "even at her most vulnerable, Manson maintains her controlling condition".|$|E
2500|$|The Rapture {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Melody Maker hailed the record at its release and wrote: [...] "The Rapture is a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica". Describing the arrangements, they added, [...] "it's a vivid cornucopia of lush instrumentation, mandolins vying with cellos and bells, sweeping strings describing starlit oceans and sirens calling from jagged rocks, and attics that hide secret worlds". Steve Malins of Vox {{also liked the}} album. He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence". Matt Hall noted {{the ability of the}} group for [...] "trotting out jolly tunes about mental breakdown, love bordering on obsession and severely dislocated relationships." [...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet that keeps you listening again and again".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

6000|$|I do {{not think}} they {{distinguished}} between it and All-Fool's Day in character or dignity. About {{the best thing you}} could do then was to write April Fool {{on a piece of paper}} and pin it to a fellow's back, or maybe a girl's, if she was a big girl, and stuck-up, or anything. I do not suppose there is a boy now living who is silly enough to play this trick on anybody, or mean enough to fill an old hat with rocks and brickbats, and dare a fellow to kick it; but in the Boy's Town there were some boys who did this; and then the fellow had to kick the hat, or else come under the shame of having taken a dare. Most of the April-foolings were harmless enough, like saying, [...] "Oh, see that flock of wild-geese flying over!" [...] and [...] "What have you got <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> coat!" [...] and holloing [...] "April Fool!" [...] as soon as the person did it. Sometimes a crowd of boys got a bit with a hole in it, and tied a string in it, and laid it on the sidewalk, and then hid in a cellar, and when anybody stooped to pick it up, they pulled it in. That was the greatest fun, especially if the person was stingy; but the difficulty was to get the bit, whether it had a hole in it or not.|$|E
