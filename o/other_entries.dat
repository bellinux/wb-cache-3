Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. <b>Other</b> <b>entries</b> are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system.

5|$|Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system {{similar to}} <b>other</b> <b>entries</b> in the Mana series: {{navigation}} and actions occur {{in real time}} within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each skill is used in battle, a cooldown meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection.|$|E
