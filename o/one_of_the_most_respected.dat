During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97%, while state banks in New York increased by 82%. The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> was Charles T. Barney, whose late father-in-law William Collins Whitney was a famous financier. Barney's Knickerbocker Trust Company was the third-largest trust in New York.|$|E

5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} {{materials for the}} painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Kraków in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> Polish artists. The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych) and displayed in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of S.G. Warburg & Co., a leading British investment banking firm, in 1995 {{for the price}} of US$1.4billion signified a major push into investment banking. S.G. Warburg & Co. had established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> investment banks in London. However, a Warburg expansion into the U.S. had turned out flawed and costly, and talks in 1994 with Morgan Stanley about a merger had collapsed. SBC merged the firm with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg.|$|E

Conversely, the game was significantly more successful in the United States, with more than 158,000 units in sales three months after its release.|$|E

5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as {{customers}} in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
5|$|Ponton {{anticipated}} that Ugartechea would send {{more troops to}} force the handover of the cannon. As soon as {{the first group of}} soldiers left Gonzales, Ponton sent a messenger to the closest town, Mina, to request help.

Austin, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> men in Texas and the de facto leader of the settlers, sent messengers to inform surrounding communities of the situation. Austin cautioned Texians to remain on the defensive, as any unprovoked attacks against Mexican forces could limit the support Texians might receive from the United States if war officially began.|$|E
5|$|Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, {{painted in}} 1821, {{featured}} numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All {{but one of}} the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although he was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.|$|E

5|$|It is {{certainly}} obvious that Jocelin was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>respected</b> {{figures in the}} kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had {{the respect of the}} secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E
