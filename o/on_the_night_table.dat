I'm afraid of dying alone in a hotel room, with my bags open and a {{shooting}} script <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table.</b> I must know whose fingers will close my eyes." [...] Buñuel died in Mexico City in 1983. Fuentes has recounted that Buñuel spent his last week in hospital discussing theology with the Jesuit brother Julian Pablo, a long time friend. His funeral was very private. There were about 50 people at the most, among them Octavio Paz, José Luis Cuevas, Miguel Littin, {{his wife and two}} sons.|$|E

His coat and waistcoat followed. He walked about the room in his stockinged feet, and his burly figure, with the hands worrying nervously at his throat, passed and repassed across the long strip of looking-glass {{in the door of}} his wife’s wardrobe. Then after slipping his braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the venetian blind, and leaned his forehead against the cold window-pane—a fragile film of glass stretched between him and the enormity of cold, black, wet, muddy, inhospitable accumulation of bricks, slates, and stones, things in themselves unlovely and unfriendly to man.|$|E

Along with the food are drinks, most often Jamaican rum with no less than 100 proof. The types of food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table can vary from one celebration to the next, but typically fried fish and bammy are <b>the</b> main foods <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. This time is very important to the family because it gives them time to celebrate the life of their loved one {{and to be able to}} say their goodbyes.|$|R

60|$|Benham's {{things were}} all {{packed up and}} the room had an air of having been {{straightened}} up neatly and methodically after a destructive cataclysm. One or two items that the chambermaid might possibly have overlooked in {{the normal course of}} things were carefully exhibited. For example, the sheet had been torn into half a dozen strips and they were lying {{side by side on the}} bed. The clock on the mantelpiece had been knocked into the fireplace and then pounded to pieces. All the looking-glasses in the room were smashed, apparently the electric lamp that stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> by the bedside had been wrenched off and flung or hammered about amidst the other breakables. And there was a considerable amount of blood splashed about the room. The head chambermaid felt unequal to the perplexities of the spectacle and summoned her most convenient friend, the head chambermaid on the third floor, to her aid. The first-floor waiter joined their deliberations and several housemaids displayed a respectful interest in the matter. Finally they invoked the manager. He was still contemplating the scene of the disorder when the precipitate retreat of his subordinates warned him of Benham's return.|$|E

5000|$|Liebeault, Bernheim, and {{the school}} in Nancy {{believed}} that hypnosis {{was due to the}} physiological property in the brain of suggestibility. Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the [...] "idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it." [...] In Bernheim's Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions, he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis. Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion."To one, I tell her during her sleep:—"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> {{and put it in the}} suitcase that is at the foot of your bed." [...] Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: [...] "Do you remember what I ordered you to do?" [...] She answers: [...] "Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock."—"Have you thought about it since I told you?"—"No"—"Think hard."—"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock."—"Were you awake or asleep?"—"I was in a drowsy state." [...] (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109-110)"Bernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.|$|E

5000|$|Unfortunately, Fay ends up kissing Muscles {{at the end}} of the song. Itchy has {{a jealous}} fight with Muscles over Fay. She breaks up the fight. Chick returns to {{apologize}} to Pinky though there still is a great deal of tension between the two of them. Fay passes drinks to around to the fighting men and tells them just to get along for tonight ("Everybody Love Everybody"). When Teddy's name is called over the P.A. to come and get her long distance call, Pinky convinces Chick to sing to Teddy. Swallowing his drink, he does ("Wish You Were Here" [...] ). Teddy enters the scene and sees Chick though the two don't speak. Gussie quickly laps up Chick when he finishes singing and Pinky tries to get Teddy drunk and take her back to his cabin. Before anything more happens, it starts raining and everyone runs for cover. Teddy stops by Pinky's cabin ostensibly to pick up an umbrella, but he has other ideas. He spikes Teddy's drink and attempts to take advantage of her ("Relax"). Itchy comes over to talk with Pinky and a panicked Teddy hides in the bathroom while Pinky attempts to get rid of Itchy. By the time Itchy leaves, Teddy has emerged from the bathroom with an empty glass wearing the sexy dress she won in the beauty contest. Chick enters the bunk with Teddy's engagement ring, and finding her there, attempts to force the ring on her finger. If she's engaged, she should act like it. She tells him to mind his own business. He puts the ring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> and leaves. Pinky prepares to take her to bed; unfortunately, while he's in the bathroom getting changed, she falls asleep. Pinky, not knowing what else to do, slips the engagement ring on Teddy's hand. The next morning outside the social hall, Herman has come to bring Teddy home. No one seems to know where Teddy is, and Herman is not too happy about this. Itchy and Marvin also bemoan the fact that their girlfriends are nowhere to be found. They then realize that the girls have spent the whole night dancing to Be-Bop records in the music library. Fay and some of the other kids enter dancing like [...] "cool cats" [...] ("Where Did the Night Go? - Be-bop Version"). Muscles takes the guests off to play basketball, and Teddy enters, finding Herman. It appears that even though nothing happened between Teddy and Pinky, Pinky is out accepting congratulations for his conquest. Even though Herman shouldn't accept Teddy's behavior, he is ready to forgive and forget. He wants to take Teddy back to New York where the two can get married. Her goes to get the car. Itchy returns to tell everyone that he's been fired form his job as Boat Boy, too. He forgot to tie up the boats last night during the storm and they all floated away. Teddy spots Chick escorting a new girl to her cabin and informs him that she's leaving. He's aloof, but polite. Itchy, overhearing the conversation, chastises Teddy for not putting up a fight. Chick doesn't even know the truth about what happened between her and Pinky. Itchy wants her to go over to the big camp basketball game and make Pinky, the referee, tell the truth. Teddy is flattered that Itchy cares so much. His kind words really give her a lift. And she returns the sentiment in kind ("Flattery"). She agrees to go to the game. In the game, the camp team (led by Muscles) plays the waiter team (led by Chick). Itchy arrives and disrupts the game so badly that Muscles declares the game officially over. Teddy confronts Pinky and asks him why he's telling everyone she succumbed to him last night. He claims that he did no such thing; however, the rest of the camp is having a great time insinuating that Teddy is now a loose woman. Pinky resists because he doesn't want to tarnish his reputation, but Fay gets him to tell the truth. Herman hears this and is relieved. Teddy gives a kiss to Chick and gets in the car and leaves with Herman. It's obvious that she doesn't want to go, but Chick does nothing to stop her. Muscles, frustrated with the interruption of his game, quits on the spot. Kandel panics! Who's going to run the camp? Itchy, of course! Itchy immediately organizes everyone to dance. Suddenly, Herman re-enters with two suitcases, which he lays down. Teddy runs to Chick and falls into his arms. Before Herman goes, however, he gives Chick the engagement ring, which Chick slips on Teddy's finger ("Wish You Were Here - Reprise").|$|E
