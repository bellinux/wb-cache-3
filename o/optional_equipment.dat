40|$|Nowadays, new constraints, {{known as}} {{smoothing}} constraints, are attracting a growing {{attention in the}} area of job scheduling, and in particular for car sequencing problems, where cars must be scheduled before production in an order respecting various constraints (colors, <b>optional</b> <b>equipments,</b> due dates, etc.), while avoiding overloading some important resources. The first objective of the car industry is to assign a production day to each customer-ordered car and the second one consists of scheduling the order of cars to be put on the line for each production day, while satisfying as many requirements as possible of the plant shops (e. g., paint shop, assembly line). The goal of this chapter is to propose tabu search approaches for two car sequencing problems involving smoothing constraints. The first one is denoted (P 1) and was the subject of the ROADEF 2005 international Challenge proposed by the automobile manufacturer Renault, whereas the second one is denoted(P 2) and extends some important features of (P 1) ...|$|R

25|$|In 1932, Allis-Chalmers {{collaborated with}} Firestone to {{introduce}} pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved tractive force and fuel {{economy in the}} range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained <b>optional</b> <b>equipment</b> into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{dress of}} a player is a {{protective}} equestrian helmet (usually of a distinctive colour, to be distinguished at the considerable distance from which onlookers are watching the game), riding boots to just below the knees, white trousers (often ordinary denim jeans), and a coloured shirt bearing {{the number of the}} player's position. <b>Optional</b> <b>equipment</b> includes one or two gloves, wristbands, kneepads (mandatory in some clubs), spurs, face mask, and a whip.

The following March, customer TR2’s took 1st, 2nd, and 5th places in the prestigious RAC Rally. The publicity derived from these accomplishments led the factory to establish a Competition Department {{under the leadership of}} Ken Richardson, supporting both works and customer cars.|$|R
50|$|In both men's and women's lacrosse, goalkeepers are {{required}} to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men's game; thigh pads and shinguards are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007. Although they are permitted to, few goalkeepers elect to wear <b>optional</b> protective <b>equipment,</b> including elbow and shoulder pads, thigh pads and shin guards, and long sweat pants.|$|R
5000|$|Chassis {{dynamometer}} {{information from}} well documented stock examples reinforces that estimate. Similarly, {{this level of}} acceleration performance is on par {{with that of a}} production line stock, 2013+ V6/ speed manual transmission Accord (278 SAE Net HP), which shares a similar curb weight. It should be noted that a Holman and Moody specially prepared [...] "stripper", which carried no sound deadener, undercoating, or any <b>optional</b> factory <b>equipment,</b> was used as the introductory press car in 1968.|$|R
25|$|Several {{five-speed}} manual transmissions {{were available}} with the naturally aspirated and turbocharged 4-cylinder engines, but relatively few Spirits were equipped with manual transmissions. All the Spirit R/Ts {{came with the}} A-568 heavy-duty 5-speed manual transmission. From 1989 to 1991, all V6 Spirits came with the electronic four-speed A604 overdrive automatic, which became <b>optional</b> <b>equipment</b> in 1992 and remained optional until 1995. The three-speed Torqueflite automatic {{was the most popular}} installation on 4-cylinder Spirits, and was also standard equipment with the V6 engine from 1992 through 1995. A 5-speed manual was offered with the V6 engine in the smaller Shadow, but this combination was not available in the Spirit.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 models {{gained a}} higher {{appointment}} of {{safety in the}} form of a locking gas cap, fold-down high-back individual seats with adjustable headrests, and the heater was made standard even on the most economical versions. New features included a split rear seat back, a 180km/h / 110mph speedometer, new seat patterns, a seven-blade flexible fan for the 258 six, new steering wheel designs for each trim level, and a new VAM grille design shared between the two versions.
