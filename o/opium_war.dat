5|$|By 1827, the Chinese {{had become}} the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They {{consisted}} of Peranakans, who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese coolies who flocked to Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> (18391842) and Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> (18561860). Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished indentured laborers. The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in kampungs. By 1860, the Indians {{had become the}} second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian Sepoy troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British.|$|E
5|$|Further {{conflicts}} over the opium trade between Britain and Qing quickly escalated into the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War.</b> Following the Anglo-French victory, the Crown Colony was {{expanded to include}} Kowloon Peninsula (south of Boundary Street) and Stonecutter's Island, {{both of which were}} ceded to the British in perpetuity under the Convention of Beijing in 1860.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his time}} on the North-West Frontier, Lumsden served as {{quartermaster}} general in 1860 during the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> where he participated in the capture of both Tang-ku and the Taku Forts. He was promoted to brevet-lieutenant-colonel, before giving his final act of military service in the Bhutan War of 1865. He was promoted again to Adjutant-General of the Indian Army in 1874, and also acted as aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria for eleven years.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Felice Beato {{left the}} {{partnership}} of Robertson & Beato, though Robertson retained {{use of the}} name until 1867. Beato was sent from India to photograph the Anglo-French military expedition to China in the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War.</b> He arrived in Hong Kong in March and immediately began photographing {{the city and its}} surroundings as far as Canton.

50|$|Opium was the Great Britain's most {{profitable}} export to China during the 19th century. Early missionaries, such as Bridgman, criticized the opium trade—but missionaries were equivocal. The treaties ending the two <b>opium</b> <b>wars</b> opened up China to missionary endeavor and some missionaries {{believed that the}} <b>opium</b> <b>wars</b> might be part of God's plan to make China a Christian nation. Later, as the social message of the missionaries began to compete with evangelism as a priority, the missionaries became more forthright in opposing the opium trade.|$|R

5|$|The 98th Regiment of Foot, {{raised in}} 1824 in Chichester, {{had a much}} shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the {{majority}} of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the First Anglo-Chinese (or <b>Opium)</b> <b>War</b> and India on the North West Frontier. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|From {{its base}} in India, the Company {{had also been}} engaged in an {{increasingly}} profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.|$|E

50|$|The social {{problems}} and the large net loss of currency led to several Chinese attempts to stop the imports, which eventually culminated in the First and Second <b>Opium</b> <b>Wars.</b> <b>Opium</b> smoking later spread with Chinese immigrants and spawned many infamous opium dens in China towns around South and Southeast Asia and Europe.|$|R

5|$|Hong Kong {{used to be}} a British colony {{with the}} {{perpetual}} cession of Hong Kong Island from the Qing Empire after the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> (1839–1842). The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and acquired a 99-year lease of the New Territories from 1898. Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during the Second World War until British control resumed in 1945. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the United Kingdom and China in 1984 paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, when it became a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China {{with a high degree of}} autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Lumsden's next {{period of}} active service was as {{quartermaster}} general {{on the staff}} of General Napier, who commanded the 2nd division of the expeditionary force to China during the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> in 1860. Lumsden took part in the operations of the Anglo-French forces, including the action of Sin-ho, the capture of Tang-ku and the capture of the Taku Forts that led up to the advance on and occupation of Beijing. He was again mentioned in despatches and promoted to brevet-Major and then brevet-lieutenant-colonel.|$|E
5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E

5|$|After the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War.</b> If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E

50|$|Edward Harper Parker (3July 18491926) was an English {{barrister}} and sinologist {{who wrote}} {{a number of books}} on the First and Second <b>Opium</b> <b>Wars</b> and other Chinese topics. On his return to England he ended his career as a university professor.|$|R
5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second <b>Opium</b> <b>War,</b> and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, threats by the {{imperial}} court of Qing to place sanctions on opium imports caused diplomatic friction with the British Empire. Tensions escalated into the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War.</b> The Qing admitted defeat when British forces captured Hong Kong Island on 20 January 1841. The island was initially ceded under the Convention of Chuenpi {{as part of}} a ceasefire agreement between Captain Charles Elliot and Governor Qishan. A dispute between high-ranking officials of both countries, however, led to the failure of the treaty's ratification. On 29 August 1842, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Treaty of Nanking. The British officially established a Crown colony and founded the City of Victoria in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a {{skirmish}} between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839. Located {{in present-day}} Hong Kong, Kowloon was then {{part of the}} Guangdong province. The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First <b>Opium</b> <b>War</b> and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. The embargo was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift the embargo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{treaties}} with the British soon led to similar arrangements with the United States and France. These later {{became known as}} the Unequal Treaties, while the <b>Opium</b> <b>Wars,</b> according to Chinese historians, represented the start of China's [...] "Century of humiliation".|$|R
50|$|Among {{the atrocities}} that Losurdo finds {{liberalism}} condoned: the Irish potato famine, chattel {{slavery in the}} United States, the Indian genocide in North America, the <b>Opium</b> <b>Wars,</b> British crimes in India, and the implementation of Jim Crow laws in the American south.|$|R
