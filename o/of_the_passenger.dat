5|$|During {{the summer}} months small {{passenger}} ferries travel between Tuckton and Mudeford Spit via the town quay. Another ferry crosses the Stour between Wick and the Quay just below Tuckton Bridge. This ferry was running before the bridge was built in 1882 and was then, the only crossing below Iford. Another ferry service operates across the harbour entrance from Mudeford Sandbank to Mudeford Quay. This ferry was operated by rowing boats until the 1960s; payment being at the discretion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Arizona v.

5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> pigeon in North America was at least partly due to shooting for use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E

5|$|Operating {{costs for}} Rich Passage 1 were funded by federal grants {{as part of}} the study, but expired at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> service trial in 2012. As a result, the vessel spent several years in out-of-water storage, with the {{exception}} of infill trips for Washington State Ferries routes and periodic test runs. During one of the infill trips, the ferry ran aground near Port Hadlock in January 2013, and was later damaged by a small fire while in storage in Port Townsend.|$|E

Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai. Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are {{required by law to}} run on compressed natural gas (CNG), and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. Motorcycles are charged approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> car rate. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid toll collection systems. The latter include smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection system which is used by motorways across Croatia, with discounted rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. Toll collection systems along the A5 and A3 are unified; vehicles switching from one motorway to the other at Sredanci, for example, do not pass toll plazas at the interchange.|$|E

5|$|The {{airport was}} built in 1942 and opened to {{commercial}} flights in 1948. It has undergone significant expansion since then and has employed various innovative technologies, such as common-use facilities. The airport consists of four runways and two passenger terminals: Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. Terminal 1 is composed of four concourses, namely the A, B, C, and D Gates; Terminal 3 contains the E Gates. A people mover system is in place between the pre-security area of Terminal 1 and the C and D Gates, {{as well as between}} the D Gates and Terminal 3. East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> terminals is the Marnell Air Cargo Center, and {{on the west side of}} the airports are facilities for fixed-base operators and helicopter companies.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} was underway the original terminus remained in use, although the LSWR was granted running rights through the station. On 23 February Major J. W. Pringle of the Board of Trade inspected {{the new building}} and expressed concerns over {{the safety of the}} arrangements for trains entering the station from the main line, which entailed crossing the LSWR's multiple tracks. He was also unhappy about the newly installed passenger lifts and the unfinished nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> terminus, but nonetheless approved the limited use of the new station for funeral trains. Soon after the transfer of LNC services to the new building the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus.|$|E
