5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, {{but they do not}} explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident.|$|E

25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly that it looks like a solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{displaying}} fast one-shot events, {{the electron}} beam must deflect very quickly, with few electrons impinging on the screen, {{leading to a}} faint or invisible image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a micro-channel plate just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of secondary emission, this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.|$|E
