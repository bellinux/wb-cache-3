500|$|Congressional {{committee}} members {{stated that the}} blend of genuine information and disinformation altered American perceptions of the USSR and possibly affected billions of dollars' worth of military acquisition decisions. Congress pointed to the multibillion-dollar F-22 fighter project as a possible result of inflated estimates on the USSR. Committee members charged that the CIA never warned the recipients of the suspicious intelligence because it sought to protect dubious sources; they cited {{a case in which}} a CIA officer forwarded 16 reports without mentioning that they were derived from a confirmed Soviet agent. In another case, questioned sources provided documents on a new Soviet anti-aircraft missile indicating it had a new capability, prompting costly American spending on aircraft radar. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Committee, called the revelation [...] "mind-boggling" [...] and sought a hearing with Webster, Gates, and Woolsey. However, Representative Larry Combest (R-Tex.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stressed that [...] "nothing has been proven" [...] and that the intelligence may not have been wholly spurious. Intelligence officials countered that Specter's claims of the reports' damage were exaggerated, saying that development and acquisition decisions would never be based solely on agent reporting.|$|E

U.S. Senator Angus King told the Portland Press Herald that tactics used by Russia during the 2016 U.S. election were analogous {{to those used}} against other countries. On 30 November 2016, King joined a letter in which seven members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia's role in the U.S. election. In an interview with CNN, Senator King warned against ignoring the problem, saying it was a bipartisan issue.|$|R
500|$|Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), vice {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Committee, criticized Deutch's refusal to deem the three former CIA directors responsible, {{saying that they}} [...] "should have known" [...] about the tainted reports. Kerrey also cited an October 30 letter from the three former directors to Deutch, in which they defended themselves and suggested investigating the CIA's Inspector General; the trio insisted that they knew nothing of the reports and said {{they should not be}} faulted for the incident. Webster, Gates, and Woolsey stated that Hitz, in a 1991 report on the SE Division, did not highlight the problem of faulty intelligence. The trio claimed they had never seen the report and argued that Hitz had failed to detect the disinformation operation. The former directors also asked Deutch to publicly announce that he would not hold them accountable, which Kerrey denounced, saying that accountability was needed to improve Agency morale. Richard Kerr, the CIA's Deputy Director in 1991, stated that the CIA debated the authenticity of 1988 Soviet military documents provided by suspected double agents, which were forwarded to the Pentagon regardless. Kerr said he never saw Hitz's 80-page report, although a CIA spokesman confirmed that Webster's office had received it.|$|E
500|$|McCain was a {{supporter}} of the Euromaidan protests against the elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government, and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013. Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces, saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough. [...] In 2014, McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell, Noah Mamet, and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary, Argentina, and Norway, respectively, arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising. [...] Unlike many Republicans, McCain supported the release and contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014, saying [...] "The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless." [...] He added that the CIA's practices following the September 11 attacks had [...] "stained our national honor" [...] while doing [...] "much harm and little practical good" [...] and that [...] "Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." [...] He opposed the Obama administration's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba.|$|E

Though Goldwater remained staunchly anti-communist and [...] "hawkish" [...] on military issues, he was a key supporter of the fight for ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty in the 1970s, which would give control of the canal zone to the Republic of Panama.

2500|$|The attack reignited {{the debate}} over whether U.S. {{government}} should expand electronic surveillance of Americans, and specifically whether Congress should adopt legislation mandating that technology companies provide a backdoor so that law enforcement has access to encrypted communication.

At a December 9, 2015, hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Comey called upon tech companies offering end-to-end encryption (such as Apple) to revise their [...] "business model." [...] There {{is no evidence that the}} shooters in San Bernardino used encrypted communications, although Comey said the attackers in the Curtis Culwell Center attack earlier the same year exchanged encrypted text messages.
