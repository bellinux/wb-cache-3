25|$|After {{failing to}} capture Petersburg by assault, Grant's first {{objective}} was secure the three remaining <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> lines that served Petersburg and Richmond: the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad; the South Side Railroad, which reached to Lynchburg in the west; and the Weldon Railroad, {{also called the}} Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, which led to Weldon, North Carolina, and the Confederacy's only remaining major port, Wilmington, North Carolina. Grant decided on a wide-ranging cavalry raid (the Wilson-Kautz Raid) against the South Side and Weldon railroads, but he also directed that a significant infantry force be sent against the Weldon closer to his current position. Meade selected the II Corps, still temporarily commanded by Birney, and Wright's VI Corps.|$|E

Grant decided on a wide-ranging cavalry raid (the Wilson-Kautz Raid) against the South Ride and Weldon railroads, but he also directed that a significant infantry force be sent against the Weldon closer to his current position. Meade selected the II Corps, temporarily commanded by Maj. Gen. David B. Birney while Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock was suffering from his lingering wound incurred at Gettysburg, and the VI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright. The positions in the trench lines occupied by these two corps were to be filled in by units of the Army of the James that would be moved from Bermuda Hundred.|$|E
60|$|The other {{passengers}} may be dismissed more briefly. Some were interesting, some neutral, and all amiable. Monsieur Fardet was a good-natured but argumentative Frenchman, {{who held the}} most decided views as to the deep machinations of Great Britain and the illegality of her position in Egypt. Mr. Belmont was an iron-grey, sturdy Irishman, famous as an astonishingly good long-range rifle-shot, who had carried off nearly every prize which Wimbledon or Bisley had to offer. With him was his wife, a very charming and refined woman, full of the pleasant playfulness of her country. Mrs. Shiesinger was a middle-aged widow, quiet and soothing, with her thoughts all taken up by her six-year-old child, as a mother's thoughts {{are likely to be}} in a boat which has an <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> for a bulwark. The Reverend John Stuart was a Non-conformist minister from Birmingham,--either a Presbyterian or a Congregationalist,--a man of immense stoutness, slow and torpid in his ways, but blessed with a considerable fond of homely humour, which made him, I am told, a very favourite preacher and an effective speaker from advanced radical platforms.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} a number of {{programs}} that are used for 3-D model railroading. Among them are the aforementioned MSTS, <b>Open</b> <b>Rails</b> (which currently uses the routes and rolling stock from MSTS), Auran's Trainz, Rail Simulator, published by Electronic Arts in partnership with Kuju Entertainment, and its successor Railworks, published by Rail Simulator Developments Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The Bamberg, Ehrhardt and Walterboro {{was built}} in 1915 between Bamberg, South Carolina, and Ehrhardt, South Carolina. In 1915, the local Bamberg, Ehrhardt, and Walterboro line, built largely with Bamberg capital and leased to the ACL to operate, <b>opened</b> <b>rail</b> {{communication}} between the two county towns. It was leased to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad after its construction.|$|R

50|$|From 2018 a new {{station at}} Custom House station will provide {{transport}} {{to and from}} the area, using the trackbed of the old North London Line. There is passive provision for a stop serving Silvertown to be built in future. Silvertown station new station opened 4 October 1987 by Michael Portillo. The nearest still <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> station Docklands Light Railway station is West Silvertown. Access was much improved by an extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Canning Town to Woolwich Arsenal, which opened on 2 December 2005. However, the old Silvertown railway station on the North London Line, was closed in 2006.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of June each year, the line could be reopened. Snow ploughs and blowers needed {{to be used for}} that purpose. On many occasions, the snow depths in the narrow alpine valleys were so great that the snow had to be removed by hand over many shifts, and with heavy {{construction}} equipment, until the FO's snow removal vehicles could be used. The construction equipment had to be transported on <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> wagons to the places where they were required. By these means, the line could be reopened two weeks earlier, but at a high price.|$|E
50|$|Usage on many routes had {{declined}} {{by the early}} 1990s. In 1989 the London to Stirling service was discontinued. The services operated at a significant loss and the service ceased in 1995 when British Rail was privatised. First Great Western relaunched a service from London Paddington to Penzance {{as part of their}} Night Riviera overnight sleeper service in 1999, but withdrew it at the end of summer 2005. It was also due to the fact, as they were carried on <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> cars, the vehicles were vulnerable, and prone to damage by vandalism, when resting in depots.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} {{established}} in July 2006 running from Pruszków through Warszawa Śródmieście to Sulejówek Miłosna. In December 2010 the line was shortened to Warszawa Zachodnia in the West, with the line S1 taking over the route from Pruszków to Warszawa Zachodnia and further to Warszawa Śródmieście. In June 2012 the line was extended from Warszawa Zachodnia through the Służewiec office district and a newly <b>opened</b> <b>rail</b> tunnel to and underground station at the Warsaw Frédéric Chopin Airport.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} and fall/autumn of 1941, vast numbers of Soviet prisoners were {{captured}} in about a dozen large encirclements. Due to their rapid advance into the Soviet Union and an expected quick victory, the Germans {{did not want to}} ship these prisoners back to Germany. Under the administration of the Wehrmacht, the prisoners were processed, guarded, force marched, or transported in <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> cars to locations mostly in the occupied Soviet Union, Germany, and occupied Poland. Much like comparative occasions such as the Pacific War's Bataan Death March in 1942, the treatment of prisoners was brutal, without {{much in the way of}} supporting logistics.|$|E

50|$|Nelson is an {{inventor}} who has discovered many applications for wax in diverse areas (including) {{the cleanup of}} oil spills, stabilizing fly ash piles, coal dust from <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> cars, uranium mine tailings, preventing soil gasses such as radon Rn-222 and water entry into homes, cocooning radioactive waste materials in preparation for long term burial, and reclaiming contaminated land for re-cultivation. In 1974 he discovered and demonstrated how to collect and prevent carbon emissions from fossil fueled industrial stacks and internal combustion engines. In 1956 he discovered and developed a wax/oxygen fuel for space rocket propulsion and coined the word, waxogen. He has successfully demonstrated wax technologies for Governments in the U.S.S.R, U.S.A. and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|All {{railways}} in Ethiopia are planned, built, {{owned and}} operated by an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise, the Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC). A 2017 legislation <b>opens</b> <b>rail</b> transport to the private sector, from the construction of rail infrastructure to the operation of the same infrastructure and on to the operation of privately owned trains. All current (July 2017) railways and the surrounding infrastructure as well as all the rolling stock are entirely owned and administered by the ERC.|$|R

External walls are clad with painted vertical corrugated iron. The former front {{section of the}} timber deck veranda has been removed, the lower level <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> balustrade replaced with weatherboards and steps added to access the bar. At the upper level the cross braced open balustrade remains as does the decorative fascia boards. Timber posts support the timber deck veranda which provides access to the tongue and groove-lined guest bedrooms through individual French doors. Behind the public bar stands an old hardwood insulated coolroom which is claimed to produce excellent temperature beer.|$|E
5000|$|Waite first gained {{recognition}} in snowboarding {{the following year}} in 2000, when she won the USSA Eastern Halfpipe Championship and also the USASA National Freestyle Championship. During the 2002/2003 season she was a professional snowboarder and continued to compete, switching her focus to Slopestyle, Quarterpipe and Rails. Early wins were the 2003 Vans Triple Crown Jib Contest and the 2003 Summer Windell's Bonfire Triple Rail Jam. [...] No stranger to the podium since then, Waite is usually in the finals of the major contests, {{and has been a}} Winter X-Games SlopeStyle regular since 2004.

5000|$|Gabbai was a Sonderkommando {{member for}} {{eight and a}} half months, during which time he and the 950 other Sonderkommando members burned the bodies of the 600,000 gassed Jews that also arrived in that time, most of them Hungarian. On January 18, 1945, the SS {{evacuated}} Auschwitz, and the few thousand inmates that could walk were filed out of the camp on a death march. Gabbai states that it was snowing and the temperature was -23°C (-9°F), and that many died en route; in addition, those who could no longer keep up would be shot. Gabbai says he survived the cold with verbal affirmations; closing his eyes and repeating [...] "beautiful Athens in the sunshine" [...] to himself. Gabbai and other prisoners were eventually put into <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> cars, and arrived in Austria, where Gabbai was forced to work excavating tunnels. He was also made a prisoner at Ebensee concentration camp, from which he was liberated by the U.S. 80th Infantry Division on May 6, 1945.|$|E

50|$|He did a most {{comprehensive}} {{story of a}} wounded soldier by braving a request to the Surgeon General of the Army to certify him as wounded as well, {{so that he would}} become privy to all means of transportations, first aid stations, and hospitals as was his wounded man. Searching the battlefield between artillery shellings, he observed a corpsman as both arms were hit. Morse was witness to all the surgeries, fed him his meals, and, in time, poured penicillin into his wounds. The photos of this soldier in pain and his arms being placed in casts, considered a model of effective photojournalism, are the commonly used pictures of the wounded of World War II. Morse was witness to the invasion at Normandy, air raids in Verdun, General Charles de Gaulle's peace parade in Paris, and Hermann Göring's trial at Nuremberg. He accompanied a Frenchman by <b>open</b> <b>rail</b> and hitched rides {{all the way from the}} German concentration camp where he had been enslaved back to the dinner table with the family members from whom he had been estranged for four years. He was the civilian photojournalist present at the signing of the surrender by the Germans at Reims.|$|E
