5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the excitatory projection <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms <b>of</b> <b>climbing,</b> bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs {{to push them}} up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
50|$|The VSI (also {{sometimes}} called a variometer, or rate <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> indicator) senses changing air pressure, and displays {{that information to}} the pilot as a rate <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> or descent in feet per minute, meters per second or knots.|$|R
5000|$|Zoom climb; dive {{followed}} by extreme nose up attitude (not necessarily vertical). Consists of an initial airspeed gain {{resulting in an}} increased rate <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> {{followed by}} airspeed loss and decreased rate <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> returning to the original speed and altitude.|$|R

5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's treatment <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> plants {{which often}} spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid, capable <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> and lifting up bricks. Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, {{is one of the most}} popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the valley floor.|$|E
50|$|In aerodynamics, angle <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> is {{the ratio}} between {{distance}} travelled {{over the ground}} and altitude gained. The angle <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> can be expressed as the angle between a horizontal plane representing the Earth's surface and the actual flight path followed by the aircraft during its ascent.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, the top <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> also {{referred}} to as the TOC or T/C, is the computed transition from the <b>climb</b> phase <b>of</b> a flight to the cruise phase, {{the point at which the}} planned climb to cruise altitude is completed. The top <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> is usually calculated by an on-board flight management system, and is designed to provide the most economical climb to cruise altitude, or to meet some other objective (fastest climb, greatest range, etc.). The top <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> may be calculated manually with considerable effort.|$|R

5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of hawk, owl and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius). Common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (Indicator minor), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> to them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E

5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) <b>of</b> <b>climbing,</b> including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The Hound Pits pub, {{which acts}} {{as a base for}} the player, was {{initially}} a larger structure. Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production {{until the end of the}} development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable <b>of</b> <b>climbing,</b> perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E

5|$|This {{park was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} official joining of Ikata to her Sister City of Red Wing, Minnesota, after which it is named. Of note is the 21-meter stainless-steel monument located {{at the entrance of}} the park, a twin sister of the one in Bay Point Park, Red Wing. Beneath the monument lies a commemorative stone plaque bearing the signatures of each of the mayors at the time. It is home to Adventure Hill—a playground full <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> nets, roller slides, and other children's play equipment. The park is free and open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{enters the}} cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. Henry goes deeper into the cave with the {{climbing}} equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse {{at the bottom of}} a cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows uncontrollably and an emergency evacuation order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.|$|E
5|$|The 2/2nd Infantry Battalion, {{supported}} by the three Matilda tanks and the guns of the 7th Medium Regiment, advanced down the Wadi Scemmas towards an Italian fort on the southern headland of Bardia. After some hours <b>of</b> <b>climbing,</b> the 2/2nd reached the headland and attacked the fort at 1645. Inside the fort were two 6inch guns, two field guns and five other guns of the fort. Fortunately, the 6inch guns were for coastal defence and were unable to fire inland. One of the tanks made straight for {{the gate of the}} fort. The Italians opened the gate, and the tanks moved inside, taking the garrison of 300 prisoners. D Company then followed a goat track that led to lower Bardia. Thousands of prisoners were taken, most from service units. Two carriers of the 2/5th Infantry Battalion patrolling near the coast captured 1,500 prisoners. Captain N. A. Vickery, a forward observer from the 2/1st Field Regiment, attacked an Italian battery in his Bren gun carrier and captured 1,000 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E
25|$|Because Mount Everest is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts.
