50|$|When {{used with}} a DC coil relay, a flyback diode can cause delayed {{drop-out}} of the contacts when power is removed, due to the continued circulation of current in the relay coil and diode. When rapid <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> is important, a low-value resistor can be placed in series with the diode to help dissipate the coil energy faster, {{at the expense of}} higher voltage at the switch.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{contactors}} {{are only}} applicable {{for use in}} AC systems. The AC arc generated upon <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> will self-extinguish at the zero-crossing of the current waveform, with the vacuum preventing a re-strike of the arc across the open contacts. Vacuum contactors are therefore very efficient at disrupting the energy of an electric arc and are used when relatively fast switching is required, as the maximum break time {{is determined by the}} periodicity of the AC waveform. In the case of 60HZ power (United States standard), the power will discontinue within 1/120 or 0.008333 of a second.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary winding}} has {{relatively}} few turns of heavy wire. The secondary winding consists {{of thousands of}} turns of smaller wire, insulated from the high voltage by enamel on the wires and layers of oiled paper insulation. The coil is usually inserted into a metal can or plastic case with insulated terminals for the high voltage and low voltage connections. When the contact breaker closes, it allows current from the battery to flow through the primary winding of the ignition coil. The current does not flow instantly because of the inductance of the coil. Current flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field in the core and in the air surrounding the core. The current must flow long enough to store enough energy {{in the field for}} the spark. Once the current has built up to its full level, the contact breaker opens. Since it has a capacitor connected across it, the primary winding and the capacitor form a tuned circuit, and as the stored energy oscillates between the inductor formed by the coil and the capacitor, the changing magnetic field in the core of the coil induces a much larger voltage in the secondary of the coil. More modern electronic ignition systems operate on exactly the same principle, but some rely on charging the capacitor to around 400 volts rather than charging the inductance of the coil. The timing of the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> (or switching of the transistor) must be matched to the position of the piston in the cylinder so that the spark may be timed to ignite the air/fuel mixture to extract the most angular momentum possible. This is usually several degrees before the piston reaches top dead center. The contacts are driven off a shaft that is driven by the engine crankshaft, or, if electronic ignition is used, a sensor on the engine shaft controls the timing of the pulses.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{disadvantage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mechanical system}} is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> breaker points {{to interrupt the}} low-voltage high-current through <b>the</b> primary winding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces from <b>the</b> constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> breakers, {{which is responsible for}} spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|R

40|$|The vacuum {{interrupter}} is extensively {{employed in the}} medium voltage switchgear for the interruption of the short-circuit current. The voltage across the arc during current interruption is termed as the arc voltage.

Also, the arc voltage depends on the parameters like the magnitude of short-circuit current, the arcing time, the point of <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts,</b> the geometry and area of the contacts and the type of magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract—A novel contact opening {{mechanism}} {{has been}} de-veloped using a piezoelectric actuator {{to open the}} contacts in a low contact opening velocity circuit breaker. The arc control on the contacts is critical for successful current interruption (103 104 A) in low voltage (250 V) devices. Previous work has shown how arc root commutation from the contact region into the arc chamber is affected by arc chamber materials, contact materials and the gap behind the moving contact for contact velocities between 1 ms 1 and 10 ms 1. This work is extended using a commercially available piezoelectric actuator to open the contacts. Contact opening speeds are assessed and the arc root mobility is characterized under this operating regime. A flexible test apparatus and solid-state high-speed arc imaging system are used to gather data on the arc root during the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> New experimental results are presented on the anode and cathode root velocity and arc root motion in an arc chamber with piezoelectrically actuated contact opening. These results {{can be used to}} improve the design of high current low voltage circuit breakers suitable for piezoelectric actuation. Index Terms—Circuit breakers, piezoelectric actuator. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{original}} method for fabricating magnetic electric contacts {{made of a}} few atoms. Controlled chemical environment and contact stability lasting for several tens of seconds allow systematic study of the electrical properties under external magnetic fields. The set-up was chosen for optimum mechanical stability, good control of {{the purity of the}} contacts and the surface composition of the electrodes, and compatibility with semiconductor large-scale processing. Controlled re-opening of the gap also provides a convenient method to make a pair of magnetic electrodes separated by a gap of a few nanometers only. ^ Quantum conductance (QC) steps at odd and even multiples of e 2 /h and stabilized conductance plateaus were observed during both forming and <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> Statistical analysis of the data revealed that an external magnetic field enhanced the occurrence of odd integer plateaus in magnetic contacts conductance values, indicating a lifting of the spin degeneracy. ^ We investigated magnetoresistance properties under varying external fields and for several orientations between the field and the electrodes. The magnitude of conductance change when sweeping the magnetic field is of the order of one quantum conductance e 2 /h for conductance values spanning 1 – 100 quanta. The relative orientation of electric current and applied magnetic field changes the sign of magnetoresistance, with symmetry properties reminiscent of bulk anisotropic magnetoresistance. Ex situ investigations of samples of higher conductance values, of the order of 1000 quanta, unambiguously show the analogy with bulk anisotropic magnetoresistance. ^ Mechanical effects that can mimic the magnetoresistance in magnetic nanocontacts were discussed and compared in our sample geometry and other published results. A new design involving nickel base electrodes was used for further reducing mechanical effects and no difference in MR behavior was found, confirming limited mechanical artifacts in our results. Our data provided significant clarification on the dispute about the reality of very large MR in magnetic nanocontacts, and we showed that no colossal effects can be found for pure nanocontacts. The largest magnitude we observed was around 70 %. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} the authors analyze {{numerical}} modeling results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress-strain state <b>of</b> a combined dam created by {{construction of a}} higher rockfill dam with a reinforced concrete face behind <b>the</b> downstream face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete dam. The analysis was conducted on <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> 150 meter high New Exchequer dam (USA). Numerical modeling was conducted with consideration of non-linearity of soils deformation as well as non-linear behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction “concrete - soil”, “concrete - concrete”. The analysis showed that though in a combined dam the concrete part gets additional displacements and settlements, its stress state remains favorable without appearance of tensile stresses and <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> “concrete - rock”. This is {{explained by the fact}} that on the top the concrete dam is weightened by the reservoir hydrostatic pressure. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> rockfill lateral pressure on the concrete dam stress state is small. There may be expected sliding of soil in relation to the concrete dam downstream face due to <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> its shear strength. Besides, decompaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> "soil - concrete" may occur, as earthfill will have considerable displacements in the direction from the concrete dam. Due to this fact the loads from the earthfill weight do not actually transfer to the concrete dam. The most critical zone in the combined dam is <b>the</b> interface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reinforced concrete face with the concrete dam. Under <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrostatic pressure the earth-fill under the face will have considerable settlements and displacements, because soil slides in relation to the concrete dam downstream face. This results in considerable openings (10 cm) and shear displacements (50 сm) in the perimeter joint. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical modeling are confirmed by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> seepage in New Exchequer dam, which led to <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> its repair.
