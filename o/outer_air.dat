5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons learned {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} solve the problem of high {{temperature}} corrosion to water wall of opposed wall fired ultra supercritical boiler, comprehensive study is carried out by combining theoretical analysis and experimental research, obtaining the variation of flue gas composition before and after introduction of near wall wind and effect of primary air velocity, central air opening, swirl intensity of <b>outer</b> secondary <b>air</b> and inner secondary air opening on composition of flue gas in near wall region. The results show that 1) the introduction of near wall wind significantly improves reducing atmosphere in near wall region; 2) among the four parameters listed above, swirl intensity of <b>outer</b> secondary <b>air</b> and inner secondary air opening have greater influence on composition of near wall flue gas; 3) under the comprehensive effect of swirl intensity of <b>outer</b> secondary <b>air</b> and inner secondary air opening, the volume fraction of CO in near wall flue gas can be controlled below 1500 ppm, which effectively disturbs the condition for high temperature corrosion. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{numerical}} simulations of particle sticking behavior near {{the throat of}} a low-NOx axial-swirl burner in a 600 -MWe bituminous coal burned boiler are presented. A comparison of simulation results with measurements using a probe with hot-film sensors shows that the numerical model offers a reasonable description. Calculated results of slagging show that slag build-up is substantial near the throat of the designed burner and that the sticking-particle ratio is as much as 33. 2 %. Because central and primary air streams remain unchanged, the mass flux of the inner secondary air is 3. 25 Â kgÂ s- 1 while that of the <b>outer</b> secondary <b>air</b> is 12. 16 Â kgÂ s- 1; however, the sticking-particle ratio can still be lowered to as little as 9. 6 %.
