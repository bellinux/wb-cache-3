5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> marks.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

40|$|Every {{company wants}} a high profit. This will {{increase}} sales growth. However, growth {{is not always}} profitable. If too fast the growth can put enormous pressure on {{the resources of the}} company. Whereas if the growth is too slow, the company considered less take the financial potential of existing firms. Therefore, the concept <b>of</b> sustainable <b>growth</b> rate can be sized for a maximum level of sales could rise without the company running out of financial resources. This study aims to empirically examine the effect of performance (ROA and price-to-book ratio), liquidity (current ratio and acid ratio) and stock returns to the deviation <b>of</b> actual <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> sustainable <b>growth</b> rate. This study uses multiple regression analysis with a sample of 49 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) of the years 2009 - 2011.

These results indicate that acid ratio variable have positive and significant influence to the deviation <b>of</b> actual <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> sustainable <b>growth</b> rate.
