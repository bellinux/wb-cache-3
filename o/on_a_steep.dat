5|$|Cromer High {{railway station}} {{was the first}} station opened in Cromer, {{situated}} to the south {{on the outskirts of}} the town <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> escarpment. Built initially by the short-lived East Norfolk Railway, the station (along with the line) was incorporated into the Great Eastern Railway, who had operated the services from the beginning. It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and {{loamy soil}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> slope (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones {{and parts of}} it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April, local villagers buried Stojanović <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep,</b> wooded hillside. By {{the end of}} April 1942, most of the {{companies}} of the 4th Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment had joined the Chetnik side or disintegrated. Rade Radić became {{the commander of the}} Chetnik detachments in Bosanska Krajina. After the war, Radić was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia; he was executed by firing squad in 1945. Stojanović's remains were exhumed and reburied at Prijedor in November 1961.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} {{began when}} five armed {{members of the}} United Red Army (URA), following a bloody purge that left 14 {{members of the group}} plus one bystander dead, broke into a holiday lodge below Mount Asama, taking the wife of the lodge-keeper as a hostage. A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge was a natural fortress, solidly constructed of thick concrete <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance.|$|E
5|$|They are {{captured}} by the gangster Bully Bull the anthropomorphised bulldog, and although they escape once, he recaptures them, before Bluebell kicks him so hard that he flies {{into the air and}} lands in Santa Barbara, where he is found and imprisoned by a sheriff. While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> face. All of them fall down the cliff, but are rescued by firemen with a trampoline, and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E

25|$|The {{house is}} built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> {{hillside}} in the Hollywood Hills {{at a time}} when the hills did not have the rich foliage present today. At the time of its construction, Storer House is said to have resembled a Pompeiian villa. Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, was both the on-site construction manager and the landscape architect, providing an illusion of a ruin barely visible within its jungle environment.|$|E
25|$|Alloway Mote {{stands at}} the tip of a {{pronounced}} meander of the River Doon on the Doonholm Estate opposite a Victorian lodge house. Its position is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> bluff and erosion has resulted in part of the earthwork collapsing into the river so any defensive features here have been lost. Bridgend Castle stands nearby on {{the west bank of the}} River Doon and is thought to have been held by the Montgomerie clan.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{animosity}} {{marked the}} relationship between Isabella and her three younger brothers Cesare, Decio and Fabio, who perhaps envied their gifted sister and the attention lavished on her education. They forced her to live in strict isolation in the family castle of Favale, perched <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> cliff above the Ionian sea. In the castle Isabella dedicated herself to writing poems, finding in poetry the only solace for her solitude.|$|E

25|$|The Lapstone Zig Zag {{became a}} {{bottleneck}} because, among other reasons, {{the length of}} the top and bottom roads restricted train lengths. A single-track tunnel was built in 1892 to replace the zig zag. However, this tunnel was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> gradient, with a ruling grade of 1 in 33, which caused problems with the smoke from hard-working locomotives. These problems pre-dated the fume problems with the first Cascade Tunnel {{on the opposite side of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Neithrop {{is home to}} the People's Park {{which opened}} in 1910, and has a bird house, tennis courts, a large field and a children's play area. The park is often used in the summer to hold small festivals. The park {{is also one of the}} town's biggest in terms of the area covered and one of the few major ones not to be built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill. Easington Recreation Ground is another {{principal}} park and recreational area.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands all train {{stations}} offer free bicycle parking, {{or a more}} secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill.

His car was fired on by a French warship as he drove to Sidon; he noticed tiny flashes blinking on the side of the ship, shortly followed by explosions on the road in front of him.

25|$|Though {{from this}} plant, {{collected}} by Endert {{on the last}} Borneo expedition, the pitchers are unknown, the other parts are so peculiar and differ from all other species in such a striking manner, that it seems allowed to me to base a new species on it. It was found <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> mountain slope, covered with dense forest at 1800 m above sea level. It reminds {{one to the other}} species, discovered by Endert on the same mountain, viz. N. fusca, by its colour and its red-brown indumentum, but it differs by its quite other leaf shape and nervation, and its still denser indumentum.|$|E
25|$|Rice, a monocot, is {{normally}} grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can {{survive as a}} perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>steep</b> hill or mountain area {{with the use of}} water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.|$|E
