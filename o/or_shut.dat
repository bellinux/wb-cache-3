5|$|With {{the rise}} to power of Nguyễn Cao Kỳ— head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force— {{following}} Khánh's departure, returned to a command role in the army. In April 1966, he was appointed to lead the I Corps, based in central Vietnam. Đính was the third commander of the corps within five weeks. This upheaval came about after the dismissal of Lieutenant General Nguyễn Chánh Thi due to his sympathies towards Buddhist activists and because Kỳ viewed him as a personal threat. In response, Buddhist protesters brought the region to a standstill with anti-American and anti-war demonstrations, some of which descended into rioting. The protests were supported by groups of rebel I Corps soldiers and the mayor of Đà Nẵng, Nguyễn Văn Man, who had been appointed by Thi. These anti-Kỳ groups formed a coalition known as the Struggle Movement. Thi's replacement, General Nguyễn Văn Chuân, refused to confront the dissidents <b>or</b> <b>shut</b> them down. He was content to allow protests provided there was no insurrection.|$|E

The group previously worked with Leavitt on The Party Scene (2005) and the Put Up <b>or</b> <b>Shut</b> Up EP. According to a studio update posted on April 20, guitarist Jack Barakat revealed the band was in pre-production. The group listened to the demos they had recorded previously, picking and choosing which songs they would work on further, as well as parts of other songs they wanted to retain. Gaskarth said the band went into the studio with around 15 songs, before that number was whittled down to three. They subsequently wrote {{a lot of material}} in the studio.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, non-Hispanic whites {{constituted}} 86.8% of the city's population. The population {{peaked at}} {{more than two million}} residents in 1950, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia <b>or</b> <b>shut</b> down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s. They are now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter of its population.|$|E
