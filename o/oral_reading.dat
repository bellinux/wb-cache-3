25|$|Between 2006/7 and 2010/11, {{national}} learning assessments (NLA) {{showed some}} improvement in percentages of children obtaining basic level proficiency in grades 4 and 8. Grade 4 increased from 41% to 43% and grade 8 increased from 37% to 44%. In 2008/09, 63.7% of grade 10 and 55.2% of grade 12 were performing below basic level. By 2011/12, poor performance showed some decrease, although percentages varied between subjects. In 2010, an early grade reading assessment for mother tongue found regional differences between 10% and 70% of grade 2 children unable {{to read and}} 90% of grade 3 children below the expected <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> fluency rate. Low reading ability related to accessibility of a language textbook or other reading material.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the oral}} {{component}} of the Syllabus B English language examination was incorrectly added to the total score because of a recent upgrade to the HKEAA computer system, and the supervisor in charge failed to double-check the results. Subsequently, many candidates received an incorrect total score, which resulted in an incorrect final grade for the subject. The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when {{they were supposed to}} receive an A (the highest grade) in the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the <b>oral,</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.|$|E
40|$|The major {{hypothesis}} {{of this paper}} is that any deviance in syntax present in oral language will be evident in <b>oral</b> <b>read.</b> 1 ng beha,viour. Using Lee and Canter's Developmental i 1 Sentence Scoring technique (1971) and Y. Goodman and Burke's Reading Miscue Inventory (1972) linguistic competence was established in three male children. ages 10 to 11, patterns of strengths and weaknesses in reading were determined., and. the relationships that were established, were examined. Results of the study indicate that oral language bshaviour is closely tied to <b>oral</b> <b>read.</b> ing behaviour.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the genetic and environmental etiology underlying {{the development of}} <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> skills, {{and the relationship between}} them, {{over a long period of}} developmental time spanning middle childhood and adolescence. It focuses particularly on the differential relationship between language and two different aspects of reading: reading fluency, and reading comprehension. Structural equation models were applied to language and reading data at 7, 12, and 16 years from the large-scale TEDS twin study. A series of multivariate twin models show a clear patterning of <b>oral</b> language with <b>reading</b> comprehension, as distinct from reading fluency: significant but moderate genetic overlap between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> fluency (genetic correlation rg =. 48 -. 58 at 7, 12 and 16) contrasts with almost complete genetic overlap between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> comprehension (rg =. 80, at 12 and 16). This pattern is even clearer in a latent factors model, fit to the data aggregated across ages, in which a single factor representing <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> comprehension is correlated with – but distinct from – a second factor representing reading fluency. A distinction between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> fluency is also apparent in different developmental trajectories: while the heritability of oral language increases over the period from 7 to 16 years (from h 2 =. 27 to. 45), the heritability of reading fluency is high and stable over the same period of time (h 2 =. 68 –. 77).

500|$|There is scant but solid {{evidence}} in Egyptian literature and art {{for the practice}} of <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> of texts to audiences. The oral performance word [...] "to recite" [...] (šdj) was usually associated with biographies, letters, and spells. Singing (ḥsj) was meant for praise songs, love songs, funerary laments, and certain spells. Discourses such as the Prophecy of Neferti suggest that compositions were meant for <b>oral</b> <b>reading</b> among elite gatherings. In the 1st millennium BC Demotic short story cycle centered on the deeds of Petiese, the stories begin with the phrase [...] "The voice which is before Pharaoh", which indicates that an oral speaker and audience was involved in the reading of the text. A fictional audience of high government officials and members of the royal court are mentioned in some texts, but a wider, non-literate audience may have been involved. For example, a funerary stela of Senusret I (r. 1971–1926 BC) explicitly mentions people who will gather and listen to a scribe who [...] "recites" [...] the stela inscriptions out loud.|$|E

Findings from the multigroup structural analysis indicated that the strength of relationships between <b>oral</b> language and <b>reading</b> was relatively invariant across the two groups.

40|$|This article offers a brief {{thumbnail}} sketch of how Irish poetry has situated “nature” inside its competing narrative forms. Beginning with Irish poetry’s earliest lyrics and concluding {{with some of}} Ireland’s most recent, and most experimental, writers, {{the goal of the}} piece is to introduce some rudimentary eco-critical theory as a means of better understanding how nature acts as a complex cultural and political semiotic, so often overlooked, in Irish literature. En route, the article examines and in part deconstructs those critical categories that have often divided Irish literature into two distinct ecological camps: the picturesque (read colonialist/tourist) and the <b>oral</b> (<b>read</b> native/indigenous). The article also considers the importance of ecofeminist theory and asks how critics might better read Ireland’s women poets as nature poets in their own right. In closing, the piece turns its attention to a number of recent poets, both men and women, who have exceeded the picturesque/oral divide and now require eco-alternative readings of nature as we enter the second decade of the 21 st Century...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project focused on dyslexia and second language acquisition in 6 th and 7 th grade students attending Norwegian dyslexia friendly schools. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate whether the dyslexia friendly schools had a positive effect on dyslexic students learning English as a second language in regard to text comprehension, oral skills, grammar and literacy. For this purpose, the test battery, the English 2 Dyslexia Test, was used on eight dyslexic students as well as on 15 non-dyslexic students from four different Norwegian dyslexia friendly schools. The results of the current study (2016) were compared to a former study (Helland and Kaasa, 2005) which tested 20 dyslexic and 20 non-dyslexic students at six non-dyslexia friendly schools in Norway by the use of the English 2 Dyslexia Test. The main objective was to compare the 2016 dyslexic group from the dyslexia friendly schools with the 2005 dyslexic group from the non-dyslexia friendly schools. The results showed significant differences in favor of the dyslexia friendly schools on the testing of <b>oral</b> production and <b>reading</b> skills. The results showed as well that the 2005 dyslexic group scored significantly higher on the testing in syntax and semantics. A secondary focus was on examining whether there was a positive effect of the dyslexia friendly schools on non-dyslexic students as well. Thus, a comparison was made between the two control groups (2016 / 2005). The results showed that the 2016 control group scored significantly higher on the testing of <b>oral</b> production, <b>reading</b> and spelling tests. The 2005 control group scored significantly higher on syntax and semantics. An additional comparison was performed between the 2016 results (dyslexic vs. control group) and the 2005 results (dyslexic vs. control group). The results showed that the control groups outperformed the dyslexic groups, except in 2016 where the difference in results was non-significant in oral production. In conclusion, the dyslexia friendly schools seem to have a positive effect on dyslexic students in the testing of <b>oral</b> production and <b>reading</b> skills and on the non-dyslexic students in the testing of <b>oral</b> production, <b>reading</b> and spelling. Further research with a larger sample of students is recommended at the dyslexia friendly schools in L 2 English...|$|R
