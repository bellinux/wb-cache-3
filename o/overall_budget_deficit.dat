40|$|Developed {{countries}} have had commendable success in improving their taxation policy systems over the years. However, developing countries face numerous tax policy challenges when {{they attempt to}} establish efficient tax systems. Uganda’s tax structure has been greatly improved in recent years, and it appears to mirror the tax system in other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, {{in terms of the}} types of taxes and rates. Nevertheless, growth in domestic revenue mobilization after various reforms has not significantly improved as demonstrated by the increase in <b>overall</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> The persistence of <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> makes it clear that Uganda’s tax policies urgently need to be reviewed to increase tax revenues. This thesis reviews {{the pros and cons of}} changes made to the tax system and assesses the extent to which they can solve the deficit dilemma. In particular, this thesis demonstrates that Uganda’s approach to tax policy does not take into consideration prevailing domestic social phenomena like the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the ongoing civil war in Northern Uganda, the expanding informal sector, and barriers to effective tax administration, all of which are rapidly eroding the tax base. Policy solutions that address these systemic problems are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} the effects of IMF {{programs}} on central government's budget balance, expenditure, and revenue. Previous works in the literature largely ignored the mechanisms by which IMF programs have effects, and this paper {{contributes to the literature}} by looking at the micro-level policy impacts of the IMF through conditionality. There have been only a few studies that address the question of IMF programs' effects on budget balance, and they suffer from inaccurate measures of budget balance and do not control for the selection bias that is commonly associated with the studies of program participation. This paper employs improved measures of budget balance and methods that correct for selection bias. Using the data of ninety-three developing countries from 1951 to 2000, this paper shall argue that IMF programs are effective in reducing government expenditure but fail to increase revenue.

40|$|Over {{the first}} years of this century, Germany’s public {{finances}} developed very unfavourably. Significant pressures to reduce the <b>overall</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> emerged. However, not least given the budgetary autonomy of the individual federal states and their influence on federal legislation, for several years central government failed to bring the German deficit ratio back below the Maastricht threshold by means of consolidation measures. Recourse to temporary measures remained limited, while Eurostat was reluctant to accept deficit-decreasing entries in the national accounts. With regard to national fiscal rules, asset sales and securitisations were used to avoid too obvious conflicts. Following the significant decrease in budget deficits experienced since the end of 2005, current European and national fiscal rules are now respected without circumventions.

The central focus of the paper is on the comparison of two types of fiscal rules: a balanced budget and a target for the primary surplus.

The primary surplus rule, in contrast, has a less pro-cyclical nature, given {{that it does not}} require higher fiscal austerity in periods when the cost of servicing public debt is higher. In a nutshell, it allows a higher degree of tax smoothing. It is not clear, however, if (inevitable) fiscal adjustments should be postponed. These issues are investigated {{in the context of a}} dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that describes an open economy, with capital accumulation, and where nominal rigidities are present.
