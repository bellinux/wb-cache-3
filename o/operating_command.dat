50|$|Bulgaria was militarily {{the most}} {{powerful}} of the four Balkan states, with a large, well-trained and well-equipped army. Bulgaria mobilized a total of 599,878 men out of a population of 4.3 million. The Bulgarian field army counted for nine infantry divisions, one cavalry division and 1,116 artillery units. The Commander-in-Chief was Tsar Ferdinand, while <b>operating</b> <b>command</b> was in the hands of his deputy, General Mihail Savov.

50|$|Los Angeles Air Force Base is {{headquarters}} to the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), part of Air Force Space Command. SMC {{is responsible for}} research, development, acquisition, on-orbit testing and sustainment of military space and missile systems. In addition to managing Air Force space and missile systems, SMC participated in space programs conducted by other U.S. military services, government agencies and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies. SMC turns these systems over to the appropriate <b>operating</b> <b>command.</b> SMC also serves as the integrating center for the Strategic Defense initiative within Air Force Material Command. It monitors progress in more than 70 Space Defense Initiative efforts throughout AFMC. SMC itself has direct management responsibility {{for more than half}} of those efforts.|$|E
5000|$|For further {{research}} of project networks {{it is reasonable}} to enter some concepts. At the initial stage the project network is in the [...] "sleep mode", so there is a regular, for a social network, information exchange between potential participants of project teams and, therefore, in a network [...] "traditional agents" [...] or other actors. After that, within processes of initiation of projects, there are project teams (the description of mechanisms of initiation of project teams is beyond this article) that are expressed in the emergence of nodes with the increased concentration of connections, the project network leaves [...] "sleep mode" [...] and begins to carry out the functions on ensuring implementation of the initiated projects. For designation of the working teams, that the nodes made in a project network with the increased concentration of connections between actors, the concept of the actor of 1 level is entered. This basic concept for a project network as it designates availability in a project network of the <b>operating</b> <b>command</b> executing the project. If actors of 1 level establish connection among themselves, for example, within a matrix organizational structure, the concept of the actor 2 levels is entered. The graphical representation of actors of 1 and 2 levels is given in figure 1.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{processing}} plants are operated (and {{for that matter}} designed) by individuals who cannot always envisage in sufficient detail the longer-range consequences of their current actions. This is particularly the case where interactions can occur between sequential operating modes of a plant. Given that the desired outcome is {{the achievement of the}} overall process goals safely and efficiently, it is worthwhile considering the factors which can mitigate against the achievement of these aims and how they can be avoided. This study describes methods which can be used to help develop safer and more efficient plant operation by the use of the computer to devise <b>operating</b> <b>command</b> sequences which achieve consecutive sets of process goals subject to a variety of constraints (e. g. the avoidance of unsafe states). The <b>operating</b> <b>command</b> sequences are required to be generated {{in the form of a}} sequence of valve operations.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1982 / Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe AFSCF as {{a common}} user net {{is a key element}} in the future space architecture. Space is {{transitioning}} from a R & D role to an operational role as the <b>operating</b> <b>command</b> integrate space systems into their mission systems. Because of the increasing dependence of operating commands on space systems, survivability of those elements is an additional requirement along with improved mission capability. The AFSCF will continue to support the operational satellites for TT&C either as a prime or as a back-up for the foreseeable future. In addition, the AFSCF will incorporate survivability technologies such as mobility, interoperability, extremely high frequencies and satellite relay to make its survivability consistent with the other space elements. This means the ground control architecture will evolve to a centralized ground support structure for spacecraft {{with a high degree of}} onboard TT&C and mission capability which will reduce dependence on fixed ground systems...|$|E
