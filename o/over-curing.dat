As {{a result of}} this series of tests and experiments, it was found that a good 	composite body from the view points of properties, productivity and economy 	can be made through curing temperature of 70 °C and curing time of 1 hore. 	With regard to compositizing properties, <b>over-curing</b> was better and on the 	safer side than under-curing, but overcuring beyond the pertinent curing conditions 	did not make a contribution to betterment of properties...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Good reliability of the encapsulation system of Photovoltaic (PV) modules is crucial to ensure the long-term performance of PV modules. A carefully controlled lamination process is required to produce a reliable encapsulation system. To date, the influences of different lamination conditions on {{the reliability of the}} encapsulation system are poorly understood. To predict the performance of the encapsulation system, the correlation of the reliability of the encapsulation system with various stress levels is required, which is poorly developed. This thesis improves the understanding of these issues by investigating the correlation of different lamination conditions with the reliability of the encapsulation system and the degradation of adhesion strength under variable damp-heat conditions. The influence of the curing temperature and curing time on the long-term reliability of the encapsulation system is investigated from various viewpoints such as curing level of EVA, chemical and optical stability of EVA and adhesion strength within the encapsulation system. The correlation of curing level and lamination quality has been identified. The effects of <b>over-curing</b> are demonstrated. Results show that the chemical stability, optical stability and the adhesion strength between encapsulant and backsheet increases with the increasing curing level. However, the best long-term adhesion performance at the glass-encapsulant interface is obtained at lower gel content. Too high curing can cause problems of bubble generation, discoloration and unstable interfaces. Among those identified degradation phenomena, interfacial adhesion strength demonstrates the fastest and the largest degradation. The reliability of the adhesion strength is further examined under different stress levels. Among different environmental stress factors, moisture is considered to cause the greatest problems of adhesive interfacial stability. Therefore, the adhesion strength is investigated under different damp-heat conditions. A methodology is developed {{that can be used to}} model the adhesion degradation induced by moisture at different humidity and temperature conditions. To do so, a stress model is established which enables quantitative description of the moisture related stresses on PV modules. Based on this model, an exponential correlation is established between the adhesion strength and the humidity and temperature levels. This enables the comparison of adhesion strength of PV modules operating at different humid environments...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 64 - 67). Additive manufacturing systems provide fast and accurate fabrication opportunities for micro-scaled structures. Various methods of processing {{are used for}} fabrication of different materials. Stereolithography is an important technique for rapid prototyping of photo-reactive polymer based materials. Similar to the other additive manufacturing methods, DLP based projection micro-stereolithography also includes limitations in terms of dimensions, minimum feature sizes and material properties. For advanced and precise micro-sized structure fabrications, process needs to be defined with a complex control scheme. In order to develop a scheme for increasing the fabrication quality, nature of the complex chemical and physical phenomena behind the resin solidification process is investigated. A complete mathematical model for the pixel based photopolymerization process is developed. According to the parameters included in the solidification model, measurements and observations are made for understanding of the resin, optical system and positioning system. Problems of <b>over-curing</b> and under-curing caused by the attenuation nature of the light inside the liquid resin are observed in the simulations made based on the model which is also supported by the previous fabrication experiences for varying structures. These problems creating structural irregularities are dependent on the process parameter of exposure applied on the fabrication surface. An iterative learning based parameter control algorithm is developed for overcoming these errors decreasing the fabrication quality. Continuous fabrication platform movement instead of step-by-step movement {{which is one of}} the main features of the established system is used to define a solution. Main fabrication parameter of platform speed is adjusted for each layer according to the error amount calculated on iterations. Use of an optimized gain for parameter control, decreased the dimensional error calculated by the count of the wrongly cured pixels up to 80 % in the simulations and 75 % in the real life fabrication trials with the application of algorithm. These improvement ratios and proposed algorithm provide a new perspective for the possible future work about online exposure measurement and in-situ parameter control of the stereolithography process. by Erkan Buğra Türeyen.

40|$|Problem statement: Occupying a {{suitable}} hot pressing time for particleboard fabrication seems very tricky for manufacturers of the wood-based panel. Longer or shorter pressing times can affect physical and mechanical {{properties of the}} produced particleboards {{and that is why}} extra care should be given on this matter. Longer pressing time can cause resin in a particleboard to <b>over-cure</b> whereas shorter pressing time can cause insufficient curing of the resin. Determination of hot pressing time is influenced by the type of filler and chemical used. The acidity or alkalinity of a filler and chemical can lengthen or shorten the time taken by the resin to cure. These parameters are usually assessed using buffering capacity test and curing time test. In this study, the two analyses were occupied to assess acidity or alkalinity of kenaf, Shorea macrophylla and Acacia mangium as well as the effect of fire retardants (zinc borate and monoammonium phosphate) to the curing rate of urea formaldehyde resin. Determine acidity or alkalinity of the wood particles through buffering capacity test. The effect of the fire retardants to the curing of Urea Formaldehyde (UF) resin was also studied. Approach: For buffering capacity test, the wood particles were extracted. Then, the extracts were separated into two parts. One part was tested with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and another part was tested with sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4). Sodium hydroxide was added into the extracts until they reached pH 11. The other part was added with sulphuric acid until they reached pH 3. The pH value was recorded each time 5 mL chemicals added. The acidity of the plants was observed by looking at the volume of sulphuric acid needed to reduce their pH to 3, whereas alkalinity was evaluated by looking at the volume of sodium hydroxide used to increase their pH to 11. Curing times of UF resin added or not added with fire retardants were calculated in second (sec). Results: Buffering capacity study revealed that kenaf, Shorea macrophylla and Acacia mangium behaved similarly in alkali and acidic conditions. All the materials had less resistance towards acid than towards alkali. Kenaf had the greatest resistance towards alkali compared with the other two species. As an important processing parameter in particleboard fabrication, the curing time of the adhesive mixture with added fire retardants was studied in comparison with a control mixture (without fire retardant with a curing time of 140 sec). Those two fire retardants showed different effect on the curing time of the mixture. Zinc borate was found to delay the curing time by more than 100 % compared with control mixture whereas, monoammonium phosphate increased the curing time by almost 60 %. The curing time for control mixture (without fire retardant) was 140 sec. Conclusion: Based on the testing results, some potential modifications to improve the curing time were discussed to avoid short curing time to improve the manufacturability of the material systems...|$|R
