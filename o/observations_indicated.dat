5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, satellite <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that {{the storm was}} poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Delores' approach, the Mexican government issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch from Ixtapa to Manzanillo on June 24. The watch and the warning were dropped the next day. The cyclone remained far away enough that no reports of high winds were received. Satellite <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that heavy rains fell in affected areas from June 23 to 26. However, no damages or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone. Tracking westward, there were few signs of organization or intensification until July12, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, a large {{elongated}} extratropical cyclone extended {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean with a pressure of at most 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The following day, the low-pressure area became more narrow and well-defined, with its central pressure deepening to 1000 mph (hPa; 29.53 inHg). On October 9, the extratropical system was analyzed {{to have become}} a tropical depression. The low moved slowly to the northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on October 10. On October 14, offshore <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that a tropical depression had developed north of The Bahamas. The following day, however, the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure. On October 16, two ships listed in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. However, since these reports occurred in a higher pressure gradient, the system was not included in HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Floyd accelerated {{to the north}} in the western Caribbean Sea, due to an approaching cold front. Steadily intensifying, the storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Unexpectedly the storm turned sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Floyd briefly attained hurricane status on October12. Around the same time, the nearby cold front spawned a low pressure area that cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was rapidly decreasing over the center due to the front, and shortly thereafter Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery, although surface <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> it passed just south of Miami, Florida. The storm underwent extratropical transition as it weakened over the Bahamas, and Floyd {{was no longer a}} tropical cyclone by late on October18. The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{throughout the course}} of the cyclone. The first cyclone watch related to Cyclone Winifred was declared by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on 29January for various locations in Queensland, spanning from Thursday Island to Cooktown, and was adjusted as Winifred approached. The initial cyclone warning was issued on the morning of 30January, stretching between Cape Flattery and Townsville, while the previous cyclone watch was expanded to cover areas from Lockhart River to St Lawrence. The warning was later extended to reach Cooktown and Bowen, and was further lengthened to span regions from Cairns to St Lawrence. On the morning of 1February, <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the cyclone had suddenly veered toward the coast, and a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was subsequently released, noting the potential for powerful winds between Fitzroy Island and Innisfail. In conjunction, the Queensland Flood Warning Centre initiated flood warnings along the Tully, Herbert, Bulloo, Barcoo, Thomson, Diamantina, and Cooper waterways. The BoM also imposed a gale warning stretching from Cooktown to Cardwell, accompanied a strong wind warning between Cape Melville and Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, a weak {{low-pressure}} {{area was}} detected south of Hispaniola. Moving northward, the low became sufficiently organized {{to be classified}} as a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on May 19, southeast of Turks Island. At the time, ship <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the disturbance had a well-defined cyclonic circulation, with the strongest winds situated in the northern semicircle of the cyclone. Continuing northward, the tropical storm gradually intensified and attained maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) by 0000 UTC on May 22. The Belgian ship M.S. Lubrafol recorded a peripheral barometric pressure of 996 mbar (hPa; 29.42 inHg); this was the lowest pressure measured {{in connection with the}} storm. The following day, the tropical storm temporarily curved towards the east-southeast before recurving back towards a northeast direction. At the same time, the storm expanded in size and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. By 1200 UTC, the cyclone completed its extratropical transition, due to the entrainment of colder air. The remnant system persisted until 0600 UTC on May 27.|$|E
5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E

500|$|Once {{classified}} a hurricane, Igor underwent explosive intensification {{over the}} following 24hours. During this time, satellite <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the storm's winds increased from 75mph (120km/h) to 150mph (240km/h) and its barometric pressure decreased by 52mbar (hPa; 1.53inHg). Near {{the end of this}} phase, forecasters at the NHC predicted that Igor would attain Category5 status, the highest classification on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. With a symmetrical 17mi (27km) wide eye, deep convection and spiral banding, Igor maintained Category4 intensity for nearly five days. Minor fluctuations took place during this period as multiple eyewall replacement cycles occurred. After the first of these cycles, the hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak strength around 0000UTC on September15, with sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) and an estimated minimum pressure of 924mbar (hPa; 27.29inHg). By this time, Igor began a northwestward track as it executed a prolonged [...] "C-shaped" [...] curve over the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{was first}} noted near St. Lucia at 0600UTC on August21, associated with squally weather, {{though there were}} little signs of any organization. [...] However, in HURDAT–the official database of positions and intensities of Atlantic hurricanes dating back to 1851–the system is listed to have already organized into a tropical storm at the same time. Nonetheless, development was slow throughout its early existence as it moved quickly eastward across the Caribbean Sea. Forward motion slowed as the storm progressed westward south of Jamaica on August 25. Though signs of development were first noted at around this time, later reanalysis {{was conducted on the}} system, revealing that it had already strengthened to the equivalent of a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Shortly after, <b>observations</b> <b>indicated</b> that the hurricane was rapidly intensifying. Passing well north of the Swan Islands, the storm attained Category 2 intensity at 0600 UTC on August 26.
