5|$|A {{radio galaxy}} {{is an active}} galaxy that is very {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars.

5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) {{are listed as}} dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt objects are {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most of them will probably qualify when more is known about them.|$|E

5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria.

5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game are also destructible.|$|E

5|$|To aid with {{navigation}} and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These {{provide information on}} the width of gaps and on the location of <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
