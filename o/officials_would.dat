5|$|On June 7, {{just two}} days after {{entering}} the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to stay at their post. He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but had hoped that the <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E

5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952. On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence Sudanese parties that gave the Sudanese the right of self-determination. During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed. British and Egyptian troops and <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> leave the country and would be replaced by Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1952 twelve {{members of}} the TSO board met to review their {{decision}} not to renew the contracts. Nine of the members {{voted in favor of}} the decision while three voted against it. It was decided that the contracts would not be renewed, but if the United States immigration <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> issue entry permits to the six musicians by September 1, the TSO would renew the contracts. This decision created a controversy and a split within the TSO board, which eventually led to the resignation of two members, Mrs. Edmund Boyd and Mrs. R. B.

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> see this type of gathering as a step towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E

Although some leaders worried that Mexican <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of dengue fever in Taiwan was always most successful in Tainan City. In 2007, however, outbreaks {{in the city}} was almost unstoppable. The fever outbreaks originally occurred only in Annan District, where the first case was reported in June. The health department failed to control {{the spread of the}} fever, and all six districts ended up having confirmed cases. There were also an outbreak in an old soldiers' home. On August 22, Mayor Hsu apologized for the disastrous outbreak of the dengue fever; he announced that the health department would be reorganized and new <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> be appointed in six months.|$|E
5|$|Yangwu was {{a wooden}} corvette, {{built at the}} Foochow Navy Yard and {{launched}} on April 23, 1872. She was the seventh vessel built {{as part of a}} larger shipbuilding program at the Foochow Arsenal, and cost 254,000 taels (353,000 silver dollars) for her construction. She was the largest warship built between 1868–75 out of the 19 vessels planned. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from Western nations, who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden-hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations. Chinese <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for purposely providing them with out-of-date equipment and designs.|$|E

5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local <b>officials,</b> <b>would</b> become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E
5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E
5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured. This was a consistent result across all age groups, genders and geographic locations. It also concluded that 41% of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue, and only 24% were satisfied. The remaining 35% were still undecided or had no opinion. As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.|$|E
5|$|The White House sent a {{cable to}} the US Embassy, Saigon on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn {{and his mother}} needed evacuation. General Đổ Cao Trí, the {{commander}} of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> meet Cẩn. On the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.|$|E

5|$|The maximum {{tenure in}} office was nine years, but {{every three years}} {{officials}} were graded on their performance by senior officials. If they were graded as superior then they were promoted, if graded adequate then they retained their ranks, and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank. In extreme cases, <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> be dismissed or punished. Only capital officials of grade 4 and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation, although {{they were expected to}} confess any of their faults. There were over 4,000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years. The Chief Instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a second-grade county graduate. The Supervisorate of Imperial Instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne; this office was headed by a Grand Supervisor of Instruction, who was ranked as first class of grade three.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Ukrainian {{independence}} {{was confirmed by}} a referendum held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum, 54% of Crimean voters supported independence from the Soviet Union. This {{was followed by a}} 1992 vote by the Crimean parliament to hold a referendum on independence from Ukraine, which spawned a two-year crisis over the status of Crimea. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of Russia voted to void the cession of Crimea to Ukraine. In June of the same year, the Ukrainian government in Kiev voted to give Crimea a large amount autonomy as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. Despite this, fighting between the Crimean government, Russian government, and Ukrainian government continued. In 1994, Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov won the 1994 Crimean presidential election, and implemented the earlier approved referendum on the status of Crimea. 1.3 million people voted in this referendum, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from Ukraine, whilst 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship. Later in that same year, the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine was recognised by Russia, which pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine in the Budapest Memorandum. This treaty was also signed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Ukraine revoked the Constitution of Crimea and abolished the office of President of Crimea in 1995. Crimea was granted a new constitution in 1998, which granted lesser autonomy than the previous one. Crimean <b>officials</b> <b>would</b> later seek to restore the powers of the previous constitution. Throughout the 1990s, many Crimean Tatar deportees and their descendants returned to Crimea.|$|E
