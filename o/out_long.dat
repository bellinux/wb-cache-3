Under Artanis's urging, Selendis severs her nerve cord and urges her fellow templar to sever their cords as well, permanently freeing them from Amon's grasp.|$|E
5|$|Charizard has {{appeared}} many times throughout the Super Smash Bros. series. Charizard first {{appears as a}} non-playable character in Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, {{as one of the}} Pokémon which can appear if a player throws a Poké Ball. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Charizard is playable, under the command of the Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has a Squirtle and an Ivysaur, all three of which can be switched between; unlike the other fighters, these Pokémon become fatigued and consequently weaker, and must be switched <b>out</b> <b>long</b> enough to recover. Charizard's moves include Rock Smash, Flamethrower, and Fly. Charizard is playable as a stand-alone character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where he gains the move Flare Blitz and his new Final Smash is transforming into Mega Charizard X. Charizard also appears as a playable fighter in Pokkén Tournament.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died <b>out</b> <b>long</b> after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{debated whether}} the Confederacy {{could have won}} the war. Most scholars, {{including}} James McPherson, argue that Confederate victory was at least possible. McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed.

25|$|Colajanni {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Banca Romana scandal. A suppressed report about the sorry financial state of the bank was leaked to Colajanni, who divulged its contents to parliament. On December 20, 1892, Colajanni read <b>out</b> <b>long</b> extracts in Parliament and Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was forced to appoint an expert commission to investigate the bank. The resulting inquiry caused the fall of the government of Giolitti in November 1893.|$|E

Đống presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long, but it was rejected because a lack of reserve forces of sufficient size available, a lack of airlift capability, and the belief that the besieged defenders could not hold <b>out</b> <b>long</b> enough for reinforcements. Thiệu decided to cede the entire province to the North Vietnamese, since it was considered to be less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế — economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E
25|$|After {{undertaking}} further jungle warfare {{training and}} serving as garrison troops loading and unloading ships, the 37th/52nd Battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 4th Brigade, was detached to the 9th Division to provide support during the Huon Peninsula campaign. Tasked with taking over responsibility for defending the beachhead from the 20th Brigade, they arrived in early September 1943. After defending Red Beach and supporting the capture of Lae the battalion received a cadre of experienced 2nd Australian Imperial Force personnel as reinforcements as they began to prepare to undertake a more offensive role. Between December 1943 and April 1944, the battalion carried <b>out</b> <b>long</b> range patrolling operations behind the mission at Sattelberg, which had been captured in November.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, after the New Model Army had {{abandoned}} {{its attempt to}} relieve Taunton, Parliament's Committee of Both Kingdoms had directed Fairfax, its commander, to besiege Oxford, the King's wartime capital. Initially, Charles welcomed this move, as Fairfax {{would be unable to}} interfere with his move north. Then at the end of May he was told that Oxford was short of provisions and could not hold <b>out</b> <b>long.</b> To distract Fairfax, the Royalists stormed the Parliamentarian garrison at Leicester on 31 May. Having done so, Prince Rupert and the King's council reversed their former decision and marched south to relieve Oxford. They sent messages ordering Goring to rejoin them, but Goring refused to leave the West Country.|$|E

A division of labor is established, as to who will fight, who will care for livestock, who will make guns and munitions and so on. A communal society is established, despite the objections of the propertied class. The objective is to hold <b>out</b> <b>long</b> enough to attract the ships of the British and French navies, patrolling the eastern Mediterranean in support of the Allied invasion of Gallipoli.|$|E
25|$|Teutonic order troops invaded Warmia in December 1519 with around 5,000soldiers. In January 1520, they besieged Frauenburg, and {{eventually}} burned the whole town, including {{the houses of}} the canons (clerical administrators of Warmia) and that of Copernicus. The late arrival of Polish troops saved the town's cathedral from destruction. As a result, Copernicus was forced to move to Olsztyn where he {{was put in charge}} of organizing the defense of the city against the expected attack. He improved the fortifications and stockpiled food and supplies, {{in the hope that the}} city could hold <b>out</b> <b>long</b> enough for reinforcements from the king of Poland to arrive. He sent letters to the Polish king asking for extra soldiers to strengthen the 100-man garrison.|$|E
25|$|Giolitti, who was prime {{minister}} from May 1892 to November 1893, {{tried to get}} the governor of Banca Romana, Tanlongo, appointed as senator, which would have given him immunity from prosecution. Before Giolitti could appoint the former bank governor, the report was leaked to republican deputies Napoleone Colajanni and Gavazzi who divulged its contents to the Parliament at the end of 1892. On December 20, 1892, Colajanni read <b>out</b> <b>long</b> extracts in Parliament and Giolitti was forced to appoint an expert commission to investigate the note-issuing banks. The close friendship of Giolitti's Treasury Minister, Bernardino Grimaldi, with Tanlongo and the introduction of a bill – endorsed by Giolitti and then withdrawn – giving the existing banks the right to issue currency for another six years, increased suspicions of wrongdoing.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, OCBC {{sold its}} 29.9% {{stake in the}} group to Indonesia's Lippo Group (under Auric Pacific Singapore) for S$203 million as they could not own more than 5% in {{non-core}} assets. In October 2006, there was a controversial board meeting, with new owner Lippo booting <b>out</b> <b>long</b> serving chairman Michael Wong Pakshong. Another board member, Chew Gek Khim, who narrowly retained her seat in the board, resigned on 30 October 2006, after serving the board for 18 years. Chew {{was the chairman of}} its remuneration and nominating committees of the corporation. She is the granddaughter of the late Tan Sri Dr. Tan Chin Tuan, the latter invested in the company when he was at OCBC. Days later, the two remaining independent directors resigned from the company's board. They are Cham Tao Soon and Winston Tan. Stephen Riady told the media that he was interviewing candidates for new independent directors back in September. Stephen has been a board director of the company since Auric Pacific acquired the company. The fallout at the AGM has questioned several retail investors questioning the manner of how OCBC sold its stake in April 2006.|$|E
25|$|Although SIGINT {{had earlier}} alerted Jackson to the {{possible}} {{presence of a}} strong Viet Cong force {{in the vicinity of}} Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August they believed they would not be <b>out</b> <b>long</b> and were only lightly equipped in patrol order, lacking sleeping gear and rations. With just 80 men—including many due to commence leave in Vung Tau the following day—they were significantly under-strength. Crossing the Suoi Da Bang creek, the firing point of the mortars was soon located as were signs of the Viet Cong withdrawal as they pushed further east. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one Viet Cong and wounding two. B Company was subsequently tasked to remain in the area to search to the north and east the following day and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with nothing to report, leaving A and B Company to harbour in their night locations. Speculation {{about the size of the}} Viet Cong in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about Viet Cong intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south-east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Despite this, neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment.|$|E
