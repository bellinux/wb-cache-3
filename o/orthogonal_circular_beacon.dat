40|$|We {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} a tilted high order paraxial vortex-beam through a homogeneous anisotropic medium of a uniaxial crystal. We found that the initially circularly polarized beam bearing the l-order optical vortex splits into ordinary and extraordinary beams with a complex vortex structure.

However, only l- 1 vortices gather together on the axis of the partial beam with the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>circular</b> polarization. One optical vortex is shifted along the direction perpendicular to the inclination plane of the beam. Such a vortex displacement induces the transverse shift of the partial beam.

40|$|Spin orbit {{interaction}} {{and the resulting}} Spin Hall effect of light are under recent intensive investigations because of their fundamental nature and potential applications. Here, we report an extraordinary spin specific beam shift of light and demonstrate its tunability in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium exhibiting spatially varying retardance level. The spin specificity (shift occurs only for one circular polarization mode, keeping the other orthogonal mode unaffected) is shown to arise due to the combined spatial gradients of the geometric phase and the dynamical phase of light. The constituent two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>circular</b> polarization modes of an input linearly polarized light evolve in different trajectories, eventually manifesting as a large and tunable spin separation. The spin specificity of the beam shift and the demonstrated principle of simultaneously tailoring space-varying geometric and dynamical phase of light for achieving its tunability (of both magnitude and direction), may provide an attractive route towards development of spin-optical devices.

This effect has limited VLA measurements of circular polarization (Stokes V) and introduced dynamic range limiting, wide-field artifacts in images made in Stokes I. We present an adaptation of the visibility-based deconvolution CLEAN method that can correct this defect "on the fly" while imaging, correcting as well the associated self-calibration. We present two examples of this technique using the procedure "Squint" within the Obit package which allows wide-field imaging in Stokes V and reduced artifacts in Stokes I. We discuss the residual errors in these examples as well as a scheme for future correction of some of these errors.

40|$|This paper exposes a very {{geometrical}} yet directly computational way {{of working}} with conformal motions in 3 D. With the increased relevance of conformal structures in architectural geometry, and their traditional use in CAD, its results should be useful to designers and programmers. In brief, we exploit the fact that any 3 D conformal motion is governed by two well-chosen point pairs: the motion is composed of (or decomposed into) two specific <b>orthogonal</b> <b>circular</b> motions in planes determined by those point pairs. The resulting orbit of a point is an equiangular spiral on a Dupin cyclide. These results are compactly expressed and programmed using conformal geometric algebra (CGA), and this paper can serve as an introduction to its usefulness. Although the point pairs come in different kinds (imaginary, real, tangent vector, direction vector, axis vector and ‘flat point’), causing the great variety of conformal motions, all are unified both algebraically and computationally as 2 -blades in CGA, automatically producing properly parametrized simple rotors by exponentiation. An additional advantage of using CGA is its covariance: conformal motions for other primitives such as circles are computed using exactly the same formulas, and hence the same software operations, as motions of points. This generates an interesting class of easily generated shapes, like spatial circles moving conformally along a knot on a Dupin cyclide...|$|R
