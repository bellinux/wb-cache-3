50|$|Whitehead {{proposed}} that his notion <b>of</b> an <b>occasion</b> <b>of</b> experience satisfies {{the criteria for}} its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity.

40|$|The prime {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the development of an adequate logic <b>of</b> <b>occasion</b> sentences and a mathematical (Boolean) foundation for such a logic, thus preparing the ground for a more principled and better founded semantics <b>of</b> <b>occasion</b> sentences. Some <b>of</b> the insights elaborated in this paper have appeared in the literature over the past thirty years, and a number of new developments have resulted from them. The present paper aims at providing an integrated conceptual basis for this new development in semantics. In Section 1 it is argued that the reduction by translation <b>of</b> <b>occasion</b> sentences to eternal sentences, as proposed by Russell and Quine, is semantically and thus logically inadequate. Natural language is a system <b>of</b> <b>occasion</b> sentences, eternal sentences being merely boundary cases. The logic has fewer tasks than is standardly assumed, as it excludes semantic calculi, which depend crucially on information supplied by cognition and context and thus [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Later, in July, as Axis forces {{launched}} an offensive in the Western Desert that threatened Egypt, during the First Battle of El Alamein the {{units of the}} 9th Division were moved back to North Africa to help stem the advance. The 2/17th Battalion subsequently carried out a blocking operation and then occupied a position around Tel el Eisa, from where it conducted patrols and observed German movements. In September, the 2/17th was relieved by the 2/15th Battalion, and went into reserve around Shammama to prepare for further operations. The battalion was subsequently tasked with active patrolling in the area, and clashed with German parties on a number <b>of</b> <b>occasions,</b> while its positions were also heavily shelled on a number <b>of</b> <b>occasions</b> {{which resulted in a}} few casualties.

2500|$|A recent {{trend has}} been to reframe Jewish {{theology}} {{through the lens of}} process philosophy, more specifically process theology.

[...] According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions <b>of</b> these <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience. <b>Occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping <b>of</b> many smaller <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because [...] "mind" [...] is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.|$|R
