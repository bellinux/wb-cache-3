50|$|Mortality {{tables are}} also often used when numbers <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> for each {{age-specific}} stratum are not available. It {{is also used}} to study mortality rate in an occupationally exposed population: Do people who work in a certain industry, such as mining or construction, have a higher mortality than people of the same age in the general population? Is an additional risk associated with that occupation? To answer the question of whether a population of miners has a higher mortality than we would expect in a similar population that is not engaged in mining, the age-specific rates for such a known population, such as all men of the same age, are applied to each age group in the population of interest. This will yield the number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> expected in each age group in the population of interest, if this population had had the mortality experience of the known population. Thus, for each age group, the number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> expected is calculated, and these numbers are totaled. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> that were actually observed in that population are also calculated and totaled. The ratio of the total number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> actually observed to the total number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> expected, if the population of interest had had the mortality experience of the known population, is then calculated. This ratio is called the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). The SMR is defined as follows: SMR = (Observed no. <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> per year)/(Expected no. <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> per year).|$|R

5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> In flat smallpox modes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E

We considered a secondary data set consisting of different parts of KSA. The study shows that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> is affected by geographic location. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> is significantly different in different cities of KSA. We also found that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> is higher in the male population. Individuals aged more than 24 years have a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> which is quite natural.
