5|$|The {{first song}} came <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just {{stood up and}} I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> closed the door.|$|E
500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Another important concept pioneered by Kraft {{was the idea}} of the flight director, the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission. As Mathews later recalled, Kraft came to him one day saying, [...] "There needs to be someone in charge of the flights while they're actually going <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to be that person." [...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E

500|$|Borland {{is known}} for {{performing}} in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and {{what he describes as}} a [...] "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, [...] "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth." [...] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{presented}} {{three stories}} that it felt were particularly emotional: {{the first was}} {{about a woman who}} removed miniskirts from her college wardrobe after being raped, but continued wearing her favorite boots; another was about wedding attire anxieties; and the third was about the choice of adorning a newly reconstructed breast with a tattoo. The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes I buy something that isn't black, and I put it <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am so sorry".|$|E
500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He {{once said to me}} that everything started to go wrong from [...] time <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|Because Confessions was his {{directing}} debut, Clooney {{took inspiration}} from friends Steven Soderbergh and the Coen brothers for his filmmaking style. Writer Charlie Kaufman {{said he was}} dissatisfied with the way Clooney treated the screenplay. [...] "I {{spent a lot of}} time working on the script," [...] he explained, [...] "but I don't think he was interested in the things I was interested in. I've moved <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't have any animosity towards Clooney, but it's a movie I don't really relate to." [...] Clooney acknowledged that Kaufman's original script contained [...] "really funky scenes that would never reach the green light of being a studio film." [...] A drug addiction subplot was removed based on Barris's request for historical authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was offered}} the part of Dot Cotton {{for a period of}} three months {{initially}} and in her own words, she was brought in [...] "merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again". Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television, [...] "and there was an argument going <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off. I didn't watch it again until I was asked to be in it." [...] The role was extended and the character {{has become one of the}} longest-running to have featured in EastEnders.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever knew what was going <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so <b>on.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron." ...|$|E
500|$|While Archimedes did not {{invent the}} lever, he gave an {{explanation}} of the principle involved in his work On the Equilibrium of Planes. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle, and are sometimes attributed to Archytas. According to Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: [...] "Give me a place to stand <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will move the Earth." [...] (...) Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed block-and-tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult, and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.|$|E
500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album.

I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going <b>on</b> , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Beckinsale {{landed the}} role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen {{adaptation}} of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. [...] "Nobody even told me I could bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language [...]|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When I was about to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then I put it <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E
