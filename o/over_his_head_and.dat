5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into the half, Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked. With two minutes of the half remaining, the ball was played into the centre of the CSKA half; Ignashevich misjudged the flight of the ball, which went <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> fell to Cissé. His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. The half was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the first chance of the half, but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|Captain De Jong {{was acquitted}} of the charge of treason, for lack of evidence, but {{he was convicted of}} {{dereliction}} of duty. He was cashiered; had to undergo a symbolic simulated execution (whereby a sword was swung <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head),</b> <b>and</b> was banished for life. The trials were then suspended in hope that the absent officers would become available. In July 1801 the trial was resumed with new indictments against officers who had surrendered ships on earlier occasions or been otherwise derelict. Several other officers were punished in an attempt to make clear to the officer corps that surrender without a fight was unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken {{over the side of}} his head using a sledge hammer, and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door.|$|E

25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then girlfriend, two men shoved the two {{back into the room}} and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 1941, Richter was hanged at Wandsworth Prison. A {{procedure}} that normally took around 15 seconds, took over 17 minutes. When Albert Pierrepoint, the executioner, entered Richter's cell to bind his wrists, Richter charged at the cell wall headfirst. After a struggle, Pierrepoint succeeded in binding Richter's wrists {{behind his back}} with a leather strap, but Richter's ferocious strength {{was so great that}} he split the leather strap and was free again. Four warders eventually subdued Richter and bundled him into the gallows chamber where a strap was fastened around his ankles, a hood placed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the noose placed around his neck. Richter continued to fight and just as Pierrepoint pulled the lever that would open the trapdoors beneath Richter's feet, the condemned man jumped in the air. The noose slipped and almost came off Richter's head but caught under his nose. Richter had died instantly but not without a struggle.|$|E
25|$|Each kohen's tallit is draped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{hands so}} that the {{congregation}} cannot see his hands while the blessing is said. Performing the Jewish ceremony of the priestly blessing is known in Yiddish as duchening, {{a reference to the}} bimah on which the blessing is said. The tradition of covering the hands stems from the biblical prohibition against a Kohen with hands that are disfigured in any way from offering the blessing. The rabbis softened this prohibition by saying that a Kohen with disfigured hands to which the community had become accustomed could bless. In later centuries, the practice became for all Kohanim to cover their hands so that any disfigurement would not be seen by the Congregation. This gave rise to folklore that one should not see the hands of the Kohen or even that harm would befall someone who sees the hands of the Kohen. Some congregants will even turn their backs to the Kohanim so as to avoid any possibility of seeing their hands—although this practice is unsupported by any rabbinic source.|$|E

25|$|Upon Jutta's {{death in}} 1136, Hildegard was {{unanimously}} elected as magistra {{of the community}} by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence {{for herself and her}} nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{minutes into}} the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to the Broncos' line {{resulted}} in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Storm. Melbourne captain Smith {{decided to take the}} tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also the Storm's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a high shot from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant Grand Final try. From dummy-half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Broncos led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later the Storm appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On its way down the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put it down for his second try but the video referee ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave the Broncos a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.|$|E
