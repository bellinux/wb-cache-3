30|$|This {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} most common form <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> received {{came in the form of}} replacing belongings (over 82 % of respondents stated they received this type <b>of</b> <b>aid).</b> Previous research has showed that most non-profit and informal sources <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> provide assistance primarily in the form of emergency and temporary housing or replacing belongings (i.e., vouchers and/or products), not direct, fungible assistance (Bolin 2006). Significant differences between ethnic groups existed only in regards to type <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> with rebuilding materials, and labor and services. These are the two most crucial types <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> for the physical restoration of a housing structure; even though, rebuilding materials was the type <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> least often received by all groups. The main sources <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> used to actually purchase rebuilding materials appears to have come from FEMA and/or SBA loans.

In this paper we examine to what extent the time profile <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> disbursements may contribute to an increase or a decrease <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness in Africa.

We measure aid volatility by two methods and assess pro-cyclicality <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> with respect to exports, thus departing from previous literature, which usually assess pro-cyclicality <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> with respect to national income or fiscal receipts.

40|$|This paper gives a broad {{overview}} of the evolution <b>of</b> Belgian <b>aid</b> policies throughout the 1990 s.

Official rhetoric on aid motives and objectives as it is captured in subsequent official policy notes is confronted with effective aid practice. It is argued that aid practice was strongly influenced by factors which are external to deliberate aid policy making. Crisis in the countries in Central Africa, which were traditionally major beneficiaries <b>of</b> Belgian <b>aid,</b> for instance, did heavily impinge upon the structure and main components <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> programme, the aid volume and the geographic concentration <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> whereas internal political discussions in Belgium, in particular linguistic tensions, largely dominated the various institutional reforms <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> department. ...|$|R

5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.
