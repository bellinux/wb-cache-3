5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have, or had, the medical {{condition}} epilepsy. Following from that, there is a short list <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> received a speculative, retrospective diagnosis of epilepsy. Finally there is a substantial list of people who are often wrongly believed to have had epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died {{in the nursing home}} and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the central}} {{images of the}} lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> only just {{realised}} what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against {{the brightness of the}} angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in large groups <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> no symptoms. For individuals with {{high risk of}} developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options {{to respond to it}} in a way that prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} occur with treatment; for example a {{granuloma}} can form at the suture site. Also, the sutured wound can tear again, as occurs {{when there is}} excessive pressure in the airways from ventilation. However, {{for people who do}} receive surgery soon after the injury to repair the lesion, outcome is usually good; the long-term outcome is good for over 90% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> TBI surgically repaired early in treatment. Even when surgery is performed years after the injury, the outlook is good, with low rates of death and disability and good chances of preserving lung function.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester Police {{operate a}} Video Intelligence Unit, whose plainclothes {{officers}} confront and video certain freed prisoners {{as they leave}} prison after serving their sentences. They also record footage of people involved in anti-social behaviour on the streets. The aim is to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube {{in an attempt to}} catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{addressed}} both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament at {{the same}} time. Although English and later British monarchs have jointly addressed the House of Commons and the House of Lords on several occasions since the 16th century, the first foreign dignitary to do so was French President Albert Lebrun in March 1939. The list excludes the speeches given by (or on behalf of) the Sovereign at the State Opening of Parliament and {{at the close of}} each parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used in the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays {{in the identification of}} pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Valor por Tamaulipas has {{a sister}} page called Esperanza por Tamaulipas ("Hope for Tamaulipas"), which uploads {{pictures}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been kidnapped or are reported as {{disappeared in the}} state. The page has a list of more than 120 people who have disappeared between 2010 and 2012. Other projects like Valor por Michoacán SDR ("Courage for Michoacán – Risk Situations"), which reported about the drug-related violence and role of the self-defense groups in Michoacán since 2013, have many followers and likes on Twitter (@ValorMichoacan) and Facebook (/ValorPorMichoacan).|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 percent <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two {{areas of the brain}} that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
