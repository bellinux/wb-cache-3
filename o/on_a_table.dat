5|$|At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took {{advantage}} of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into his hat and then placing his hat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> adjacent to the scanner. The security guards were not as strict as now since the incident took place before 9/11 and they allowed Demeke to pass.|$|E

5|$|During an autopsy, {{the agents}} {{discover}} that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could {{have been caused by}} inbreeding. Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a shovel <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> Arrest warrants are issued for the three brothers. In retaliation, the Peacocks break into Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder him and his wife.|$|E
30|$|One {{hundred and}} six {{patients}} (149 SCFEs) {{were included in}} the study. There were 70 males and 36 females, with an average age of 12.5  years (range 8 – 19  years) at the time of surgery and an average follow-up time at last visit of 1.1  years (range 6  months to 5.5  years). Thirty-six hips were fixed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fracture <b>table</b> and 113 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent <b>table.</b> Eighty-nine percent (134) of hips had slips that were classified as stable, whereas 10 % (15) were unstable. Of the 134 hips with stable SCFE, 101 (75 %) were treated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent <b>table</b> and 33 (25 %) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fracture <b>table.</b> Of the 15 unstable hips, 12 (80 %) were treated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent <b>table</b> and three (20 %) were treated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fracture <b>table.</b> There were 52 unilaterally involved left and 41 right SCFEs. Twenty-six of these unilateral procedures were done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fracture <b>table</b> and 67 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent <b>table.</b> Twenty-eight patients (56 hips) were fixed in a single bilateral procedure. Of the hips that were fixed in a single-stage bilateral procedure, ten were fixed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fracture <b>table</b> and 46 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent <b>table.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following {{the murder}} of Librescu, {{at the request of}} his family and with the {{assistance}} of Gov.

In his native Romania, his picture was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, and a candle was lit. People laid flowers nearby.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> {{in an almost}} Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus {{seems to be on}} his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E

5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath is bound in crimson velvet {{decorated}} with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. At coronations, a peer gives the Sword of State to the Lord Great Chamberlain who places it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in StEdward's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E
5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> {{while the rest}} of the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|In another vision Scully lies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> and is {{visited by}} her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa {{in the hospital}} cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was the Hell in a Cell match between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. The match began with Michaels {{delivering}} a Thesz Press and slamming Triple H {{into the cell}} wall, resulting in Triple H bleeding. Triple H got the advantage, as {{he was able to}} counter a piledriver and performed a back body drop on Michaels. Another attack saw Triple H hit Michaels with the steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. A spot in the match saw Michaels lay Triple H <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> as he climbed onto a ladder that he took out from under the ring, and performed a diving elbow drop onto Triple H through the table. Afterwards, Triple H gained the advantage and performed a Pedigree on Michaels for the win. After the match, Michaels was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
5|$|The rolls {{were all}} of roughly the same length, about 5.5m (15ft), and would most likely have been {{presented}} side by side for display <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> or hung on a wall. The {{focal point of the}} whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed {{at the beginning of the}} third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E
