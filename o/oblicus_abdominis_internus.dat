40|$|Background. The {{mechanisms}} by which the abdominal muscles move and control the lumbosacral spine are not clearly understood. Descriptions of abdominal morphology are also conflicting and the regional anatomy of these muscles has not been comprehensively examined. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the morphology of regions of transversus <b>abdominis</b> and obliquus <b>internus</b> and externus <b>abdominis.</b> Methods. Anterior and posterolateral abdominal walls were dissected bilaterally in 26 embalmed human cadavers. The orientation, thickness and length of the upper, middle and lower fascicles of transversus <b>abdominis</b> and obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> and the upper and middle fascicles of obliquus externus abdominis were measured. Findings. Differences in fascicle orientation, thickness and length were documented between the abdominal muscles and between regions of each muscle. The fascicles of transversus abdominis were horizontal in the upper region, with increasing inferomedial orientation in the middle and lower regions. The upper and middle fascicles of obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> were oriented superomedially and the lower fascicles inferomedially. The mean vertical dimension of transversus abdominis that attaches to the lumbar spine via the thoracolumbar fascia was 5. 2 (SD 2. 1) cm. Intramuscular septa were observed between regions of transversus <b>abdominis,</b> and obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> could be separated into two distinct layers in the lower and middle regions. Interpretation. This study provides quantitative data of morphological differences between regions of the abdominal muscles, which suggest variation in function between muscle regions. Precise understanding of abdominal muscle anatomy is required for incorporation of these muscles into biomechanical models. Furthermore, regional variation in their morphology may reflect differences in function. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the intra-session and inter-rater {{reliability}} of shear modulus measured in abdominal muscles during two commonly used trunk stability exercises. Thirty healthy volunteers performed a series of abdominal hollow and abdominal brace tasks. Supersonic shear imaging was used to measure the shear modulus (considered an index of muscle tension) of the four anterior trunk muscles: obliquus externus <b>abdominis,</b> obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> transversus abdominis and rectus abdominis. Because of measurement artifacts, <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and transversus abdominis data were not analyzed for 36. 7 % and 26. 7 % of the participants, respectively. These participants exhibited thicker superficial fat layers than the others. For the remaining participants, fair to excellent intra-session and inter-rater reliability was observed with moderate to high intra-class coefficients (0. 45 – 0. 97) and low to moderate standard error of measurement values (0. 38 – 3. 53 kPa).

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{associations between}} deep abdominal muscle activation and long-term pain outcome in chronic non-specifi c {{low back pain}} (LBP). Methods Recruitment of transversus <b>abdominis</b> and obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> during the abdominal drawing-in manoeuvre was recorded by B-mode ultrasound and anticipatory onset of deep abdominal muscle activity with M-mode ultrasound. Recordings were done before and after 8 weeks with guided exercises for 109 patients with chronic non-specifi c LBP. Pain was assessed with a numeric rating scale (0 – 10) before and 1 year after intervention. Associations between muscle activation and long-term pain were examined by multiple linear and logistic regression methods. Results Participants {{with a combination of}} low baseline lateral slide in transversus abdominis and increased slide after intervention had better odds for long-term clinically important pain reduction (≥ 2 points on the numeric rating scale) compared with participants with small baseline slide and no improvement in slide (OR 14. 70, 95 % CI 2. 41 to 89. 56). There were no associations between contraction thickness ratios in transversus <b>abdominis</b> or obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> and pain at 1 -year follow-up. Transversus abdominis lateral slide before intervention was marginally associated with a lower OR for clinically important improvement in pain at 1 -year follow-up (OR 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 62 to 0. 93). Delayed onset of the abdominal muscles after the intervention period was weakly associated with higher long-term pain. Conclusion Improved transversus abdominis lateral slide among participants with low baseline slide was associated with clinically important long-term pain reduction. High baseline slide and delayed onset of abdominal muscles after the intervention period were weakly associated with higher pain at 1 -year follow-up.

40|$|The Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR) is an {{important}} test in diagnosing pelvic girdle pain (PGP). It is difficult to understand what happens normally during the ASLR, let alone why it would be impaired in PGP. In the present study, healthy subjects performed the ASLR under normal conditions, with weight added above the ankle, and while wearing a pelvic belt. Activity of the abdominal muscles, rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) was recorded with surface electromyography (EMG), and transversus abdominis (TA) with fine wire EMG. RF was ipsilaterally active, BF contralaterally, and the abdominal muscles bilaterally. All muscle activity was higher with weight, and abdominal muscle activity was lower with the pelvic belt. In both these conditions, TA and obliquus <b>abdominis</b> <b>internus</b> (OI) were more asymmetrically active than obliquus externus. The abdominal muscles engage in multitasking, combining symmetric and asymmetric task components. Hip flexion causes an unwanted forward pull on the ipsilateral ilium, which is counteracted by contralateral BF activity. To transfer this contralateral force toward ipsilateral, the lateral abdominal muscles press the ilia against the sacrum (" force closure"). Thus, problems with the ASLR may derive from problems with force closure. Also abdominal wall activity counteracts forward rotation of the ilium. Moreover, contralateral BF activity causes transverse plane rotation of the pelvis, often visible as an upward movement of the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine. Such transverse plane rotation is countered by ipsilateral TA and OI. The present study facilitates the understanding of what normally happens during the ASLR. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Cross-sectional {{study of}} electromyographic onsets of trunk and hip muscles in {{subjects}} with a clinical diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and matched control subjects. Objectives. To determine whether muscle activation of the supporting leg was different between control subjects and subjects with sacroiliac joint pain during hip flexion in standing. Background. Activation of the trunk and gluteal muscles stabilize the pelvis for load transference; however, the temporal pattern of muscle activation {{and the effect of}} pelvic pain on temporal parameters has not been investigated. Methods. Fourteen men with a clinical diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and healthy age-matched control subjects were studied. Surface electromyographic activity was recorded from seven trunk and hip muscles of the supporting leg during hip flexion in standing. Onset of muscle activity relative to initiation of the task was compared between groups and between limbs. Results. The onset of obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (OI) and multifidus occurred before initiation of weight transfer in the control subjects. The onset of obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> multifidus, and gluteus maximus was delayed on the symptomatic side {{in subjects with}} sacroiliac joint pain compared with control subjects, and the onset of biceps femoris electromyographic activity was earlier. In addition, electromyographic onsets were different between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in subjects with sacroiliac joint pain. Conclusions. The delayed onset of obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> multifidus, and gluteus maximus electromyographic activity of the supporting leg during hip flexion, in subjects with sacroiliac joint pain, suggests an alteration in the strategy for lumbopelvic stabilization that may disrupt load transference through the pelvis...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} ultrasonography to estimate musactivity, we measured architectural parameters (pennation angles, fascicle lengths, and muscle thickness) of several human muscles (tibialis anterior, biceps brachii, brachialis, transversus <b>abdominis,</b> obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis,</b> and obliquus externus abdominis) during isometric contractions of from 0 to 100 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Concurrently, electromyographic (EMG) activity was measured with surface (tibialis anterior only) or fine-wire electrodes. Most architectural parameters changed markedly with contractions up to 30 % MVC but changed little at higher levels of contraction. Thus, ultrasound imaging {{can be used to}} detect low levels of muscle activity but cannot discriminate between moderate and strong contractions. Ultrasound measures could reliably detect changes in EMG of as little as 4 % MVC (biceps muscle thickness), 5 % MVC (brachialis muscle thickness), or 9 % MVC (tibialis anterior pennation angle). They were generally less sensitive to changes in abdominal muscle activity, but it was possible to reliably detect contractions of 12 % MVC in transversus abdominis (muscle length) and 22 % MVC in obliquus internus (muscle thickness). Obliquus externus abdominis thickness did not change consistently with muscle contraction, so ultrasound measures of thickness cannot be used to detect activity of this muscle. Ultrasound imaging can thus provide a non-invasive method of detecting isometric muscle contractions of certain individual muscles...|$|R

Four different treatments - papain (P), blade tenderization (B), papain + blade tenderization (P+B), and control (C) - were applied to sixty USDA Choice M. diaphragma pars costalis, M. transversus abdominis, M. obliquus <b>abdominis</b> <b>internus,</b> M. rhomboideus, M. trapezius, M. latissimus, and M. serratus ventralis. Muscles were cut into sections and frozen at - 10 ?C for evaluation by a trained sensory panel, consumer panel, and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) measurements. Trained panelists found that regardless of muscle, the addition of papain improved palatability scores. In general, treatment tended not to affect the palatability scores of the M. diaphragma pars costalis and M. serratus ventralis, which tended to receive higher scores in comparison to the other muscles. In general, the control and blade tenderized M. trapezius received the lowest trained and consumer panel palatability scores and had the highest WBSF values (P 0. 05) tenderness ratings when the P treatment was applied. Consumers tended to prefer the flavor and tenderness of beef fajita strips that were treated with P and P+B and indicated a preference to purchase muscles with these treatments. Consumers were willing to purchase M. serratus ventralis treated with P+B and M. latissimus treated with P the majority of the time. Papain improved the eating quality of the muscles studied.

40|$|Unexpected ventral and dorsal {{perturbations}} and expected, self-induced ventral perturbations {{were delivered}} to the trunk by suddenly loading a vest strapped to the torso. Six male subjects were measured for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intra-muscular electromyography of the transversus <b>abdominis</b> (TrA), obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (OI), obliquus externus abdominis (OE) and rectus abdominis (RA) muscles. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using surface electromyography. Displacements of the trunk and head were registered using a video-based system. Unexpected ventral loading produced activity in TrA, OI, OE and RA, and an IAP increase {{well in advance of}} activity from ES. Expected ventral loading produced pre-activation of all muscles and an increased IAP prior to the perturbation. The TrA was always the first muscle active in both the unexpected and self-loading conditions. Of the two ventral loading conditions. forward displacement of the trunk was significantly reduced during the self-loading. Unexpected dorsal loading produced coincident activation of TrA, OI, OE, RA and ES. These results indicate a response of the trunk muscles to sudden expected and unexpected ventral loadings other than the anticipated immediate extensor torque production through ES activation. It is suggested that the increase in IAP is a mechanism designed to improve the stability of the trunk through a stiffening of the whole segment...|$|R
40|$|Because the {{structure}} of the spine is inherently unstable, muscle activation is essential for the maintenance of trunk posture and intervertebral control when the limbs are moved. To investigate how the central nervous system deals with this situation the temporal components of the response of the muscles of the trunk were evaluated during rapid limb movement performed in response to a visual stimulus. Fine-wire electromyography (EMG) electrodes were inserted into transversus <b>abdominis</b> (TrA), obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (OI) and obliquus externus abdominis (OE) of 15 subjects under the guidance of real-time ultrasound imaging. Surface electrodes were placed over rectus abdominis (RA), lumbar multifidus (MF) and the three parts of deltoid. In a standing position, ten repetitions of shoulder flexion, abduction and extension were performed by the subjects as fast as possible in response to a visual stimulus. The onset of TrA EMG occurred in advance of deltoid irrespective of the movement direction. The time to onset of EMC activity of OI, OE, RA and MF varied with the movement direction, being activated earliest when the prime action of the muscle opposed the reactive forces associated with the specific limb movement.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} possible relationships between activities of the individual muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall {{and the development of}} pressure within the abdominal cavity. Intra‐muscular activity was recorded bilaterally from transversus <b>abdominis,</b> obliquus <b>internus,</b> obliquus externus and rectus abdominis with fine‐wire electrodes guided into place using real‐time ultrasound. Intra‐abdominal pressure was measured intragastrically using a micro tip pressure transducer. Six males were studied during loading and movement tasks with varied levels of intra‐abdominal pressure. During both maximal voluntary isometric trunk flexion and extension, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained constant, while all other abdominal muscles showed a marked reduction during extension. When maximal isometric trunk flexor or extensor torques were imposed upon a maximal Valsalva manoeuvre, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained comparable within and across conditions, whereas obliquus internus, obliquus externus and rectus abdominis activities either markedly increased (flexion) or decreased (extension). Trunk twisting movements showed reciprocal patterns of activity between the left and right sides of transversus abdominis, indicating an ability for torque development. During trunk flexion‐extension, transversus abdominis showed less distinguished changes of activity possibly relating to a general stabilizing function. In varied pulsed Valsalva manoeuvres, changes in peak intra‐abdominal pressure were correlated with mean amplitude electromyograms of all abdominal muscles, excluding rectus abdominis. It is concluded that the coordinative patterns shown between the muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall are task specific based upon demands of movement, torque and stabilization. It appears that transversus ahdominis is the abdominal muscle whose activity is most consistently related to changes in intra‐abdominal pressure...|$|R

The latter occurred < 50 ms after the onset of medial deltoid EMG (i. e., was feedforward) and correlated with the corresponding EMG onsets (r = 0. 47, P < 0. 0001). The mean difference between methods was 20 ms and was likely explained by electromechanical delay; limits of agreement were wide (- 40 to + 80 ms) but no greater than those typical of repeated measurements using either technique. The between-day standard error of measurement of the TDI onsets (examined in 16 further subjects) was 16 ms.

The fascial lines bordering the transvs. <b>abdominis,</b> obliquus <b>internus</b> and obliquus externus were digitized and the absolute thickness, relative thickness (% of total lateral thickness) and contraction ratio (thickness during hollowing/thickness at rest), as well as the asymmetry (difference between sides expressed as a percent of the smallest value for the two sides) for each of these parameters were determined for each muscle. Both at rest and during hollowing, obliquus internus was the thickest and transvs. abdominis the thinnest muscle. There {{were no significant differences between}} left and right sides for group mean thicknesses of any muscle; however, individual asymmetries were evident, with mean values for the different muscles ranging from 11 % to 26 %; asymmetry was much less for the contraction ratios (mean % side differences, 5 - 14 % depending on muscle). Body mass was the most significant positive predictor of absolute muscle thickness, for all muscles at rest and during hollowing, accounting for 30 - 44 % variance. Body mass index explained 20 - 30 % variance in transvs. abdominis contraction ratio (negative relationship).

40|$|The {{effect of}} aging on {{metabolic}} enzyme activity remains controversial, possibly due to physical activity differences. We examined {{the effect of}} aging on the enzyme activity for anaerobic and aerobic pathways in nonweight-bearing human skeletal muscle from relatively sedentary males. The muscle obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> was analyzed for anaerobic (creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase) and aerobic (2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase) enzyme activities in two groups: middle-aged (29 – 54 years) and older (61 – 74 years) adults. All enzyme activities were lower in older versus middle-aged adults when results were expressed as muscle wet weight (p,. 05). When activity was expressed relative to the protein content, only lactate dehydrogenase remained significantly lower in older versus middle-aged adults (p,. 001).

Whether this is related to differential changes in excitability of descending corticomotor inputs remains unclear and was investigated in nine healthy individuals. Fine-wire i. m. electrodes were inserted bilaterally into deep (transversus abdominis (TrA)) and superficial abdominal muscles (obliquus externus abdominis (OE)), and surface electrodes were placed bilaterally over obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (OI), rectus abdominis (RA) and lumbar erector spinae (LES) muscles. Corticomotor excitability was assessed as amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at a range of stimulator intensities, at rest and during voluntary abdominal contractions. Pain was induced by injection of hypertonic saline into interspinous ligaments of the lumbar spine. Corticomotor excitability was examined before, {{during and after the}} induction of LBP. During pain, amplitude of TrA MEPs to contralateral cortical stimulation was reduced, whereas amplitudes of OE and LES MEPs contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulated cortex were increased. The findings highlight differential changes in excitability of corticomotor inputs to trunk muscles during acute LBP. Further work is required to reveal whether such changes involve spinal and/or supraspinal centres and their consequence for spine control. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Various {{exercises}} {{are used to}} retrain the abdominal muscles {{in the management of}} low back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders. However. few studies have directly investigated the activity of all the abdominal muscles or the recruitment of regions of the abdominal muscles during these manoeuvres. This study examined the activity of different regions of transversus <b>abdominis</b> (TrA), obliquus <b>internus</b> (OI) and externus abdominis (OE), and rectus abdominis (RA), and movement of lumbar spine, pelvis and abdomen during inward movement of the lower abdominal wall, abdominal bracing, pelvic tilting, and inward movement of the lower and upper abdominal wall. Inward movement of the lower abdominal wall in supine produced greater activity of TrA compared to OI. OE and RA. During posterior pelvic tilting. middle OI was most active and with abdominal bracing. OE was predominately recruited. Regions of TrA were recruited differentially and in inverse relationship between lumbopelvic motion and TrA electromyography (EMG) was found. This study indicates that inward movement of the abdominal wall in supine produces the most independent activity of TrA relative to the other abdominal muscle, recruitment varies between regions of TrA, and observation of abdominal and lumbopelvic motion may assist in evalation of exercise performance.

40|$|AIM: The lumbar spinal {{stabilization}} {{techniques in}} abdominal hollowing and bracing {{are known to}} facilitate the level of activity in the muscles transversus <b>abdominis</b> and obliquus <b>internus</b> (TA/OI). The relative timing of activation {{and the effect of}} combination with other tasks are currently unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the performance of abdominal hollowing and bracing could promote the voluntary preferential recruitment of TA/OI muscles when performed prior to abdominal strengthening exercise variations. METHODS: The trunk muscles TA/OI, rectus abdominis and obliquus externus were investigated using surface EMG. A pressure transducer under the lumbar spine detected spinal movement. Eighteen male subjects performed a series of 4 abdominal strengthening exercise variations. Pressure cuff and electromyographic onset times were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: TA/OI muscle site was recruited significantly earlier than the upper rectus abdominis site for the hollow with curl exercise. The TA/OI site was also ranked as first activated site in the majority of subjects during exercises where stabilization techniques of hollowing and bracing were used. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal hollowing was an effective method for selective preferential voluntary recruitment of TA/OI site prior to the performance of the curl type abdominal strengthening exercise variation. The other variations brace with curl and hold and hollow with rotation also tend to recruit TA/OI site first, however the timing was not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is {{prescribed}} worldwide {{to patients}} with hypercholesterolemia. Although simvastatin is well tolerated, side effects like myotoxicity are reported. The mechanism for statin-induced myotoxicity is still poorly understood. Reports have suggested impaired mitochondrial dysfunction as {{a contributor to the}} observed myotoxicity. In this regard, we wanted to study the effects of simvastatin on glucose metabolism and the activity of legumain, a cysteine protease. Legumain, being the only known asparaginyl endopeptidase, has caspase-like properties and is described to be involved in apoptosis. Recent evidences indicate a regulatory role of both glucose and statins on cysteine proteases in monocytes. Satellite cells were isolated from the Musculus obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> of healthy human donors, proliferated and differentiated into polynuclear myotubes. Simvastatin with or without mevalonolactone, farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were introduced on day 5 of differentiation. After 48 h, cells were either harvested for immunoblotting, ELISA, cell viability assay, confocal imaging or enzyme activity analysis, or placed in a fuel handling system with [14 C]glucose or [3 H]deoxyglucose for uptake and oxidation studies. A dose-dependent decrease in both glucose uptake and oxidation were observed in mature myotubes after exposure to simvastatin in concentrations not influencing cell viability. In addition, simvastatin caused a decrease in maturation and activity of legumain. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism and decreased legumain activity by simvastatin points out new knowledge about the effects of statin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{values of}} {{membrane}} action potentials and maximum depolarization rates of single muscle fibers in normal Tyrode solution and in low sodium solutions containing {{as little as}} 20 per cent of the sodium chloride were measured with intracellular microelectrodes. Under these conditions the membrane potential remains unchanged up to 36 per cent of [Na+]ou, concentration, whereas the overshoot of the action potential varies linearly with the logarithm of the external sodium concentration. The maximum depolarization rate is a linear function of the external sodium concentration. The results obtained support the ionic theory for sodium and the independence principle for sodium current related to the external sodium concentration. The validity of the ionic theory for the striated fiber of frog's sartorius muscle was demonstrated by Nastuk and Hodgkin (1). The purpose of our research was to ascertain the validity of such theory with regard to [Na +] in the striated muscle fiber of mammals. This was done by measuring the action potential and the maximum rate of depolarization at different external concentrations of sodium ions. METHOD All experiments were carried out on the obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> muscle of guinea pigs. The muscle was excised from the animal, transferred to a plexiglas cell, and irrigated with Tyrode solution. The solution was thermostatically maintained at 37. 5 °C and aerated with 95 per cent oxygen and 5 per cent carbon dioxide. The composition of the solution (Tyrode, 1910) was as follows: [...] NaC 1 136. 9 tara/lite...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of this research {{lies in the fact}} that it makes a meaningful contribution to the development of comprehensive injury prevention programmes. The studies included in this thesis investigate technique-related intrinsic factors where injury is prevented at the expense of performance as well as intrinsic factors where there is potential for both injury prevention and performance to be simultaneously optimised. The cricket pace bowler is prone to injury due to the high load nature of the pace bowling action involving a complex sequence of forceful actions, consisting of practiced, particular movements. Various injury prevention programmes incorporating extrinsic factors have been studied and implemented previously, however the intrinsic factors associated with both injury and performance in pace bowlers have not yet been investigated sufficiently. In this thesis an overview of the literature includes the review of injuries sustained by pace bowlers, factors associated with injury and performance, and the kinematics of the pace bowling action. Premier league (amateur) cricket pace bowlers were recruited for this study. All pace bowlers were injury free at the start of the season. Details around past injuries as well as incidence of injuries were recorded throughout an eight month cricket season. Performance measures, namely ball release speed and accuracy, were measured during execution of the pace bowling action. Included in this thesis are six original papers. The first five papers investigated the association between intrinsic factors, injury and performance, while the sixth paper described abdominal muscle adaptations in the pace bowler. The first paper (Chapter 2) investigated bowlers’ ability to perform lumbo-pelvic movement control, static and dynamic balance tests at the start and at the end of a cricket season. Lumbo-pelvic movement control tests could not discriminate between bowlers who sustained an injury during the cricket season and bowlers who did not. However, performance in the single leg balance test (SLBT) (p= 0. 03) and the star excursion balance test (SEBT) (p= 0. 02) as measured at the start of the season, was better in bowlers who did not sustain an injury during the season. Paper 2 (Chapter 3) investigated lumbar proprioception (as measured by joint position sense) in the neutral lumbar spine position; as well as lumbar positions corresponding to those at front foot placement and ball release of the cricket pace bowling action in relation to previous injury and injury sustained during the cricket season under review. Lumbar reposition error in the sagittal plane (flexion-extension) was between 1. 48 ˚ and 1. 82 ˚ and in the frontal plane (left-right lateral flexion) it was between 0. 81 ˚ and 0. 88 ˚. Lumbar reposition error, as measured in two planes and in three different positions, was associated with self-reported general injuries, injuries sustained during the bowling action and especially, low back injury sustained in the past (p 0. 05). Furthermore, correlations between knee position error and reproduced knee angles were also not statistically significant (r=- 0. 35 to r= 0. 09; p> 0. 05). It was concluded that static knee joint position sense is not associated with dynamic knee angle during the bowling action, or with ball release speed and that dynamic mechanisms may contribute to knee angles and bowling speeds. The sixth study (Chapter 7) investigated and highlighted the possible muscle adaptations in absolute muscle thickness and activity as a consequence of the asymmetrical bowling action. The absolute thickness of the non-dominant obliquus <b>abdominis</b> <b>internus</b> (OI) was higher than that of the dominant OI at the start (p< 0. 0001) as well as at the end of the cricket season (p< 0. 0001). At the start of the season the percentage change during the abdominal drawing in manoeuvre, thus a measure of muscle activity, was higher for the non-dominant OI than for the dominant OI (p= 0. 02). Absolute thickness of the dominant obliquus abdominis externus (OE) at rest was significantly higher at the end of the season compared with at the start of the season (p< 0. 0001). During right side active straight leg raise, the activity of the left transversus abdominis (TA) was significantly higher than that of the right TA during left side active straight leg raise (p= 0. 03) when measured at the end of the season. These asymmetries in abdominal muscle thickness and activity may contribute to the predisposition to low back injury in cricket pace bowlers or may occur in an attempt to protect the pace bowler against injury. In conclusion, the high load nature of the pace bowling action allows for high ball release speeds to be attained but at the same time renders the pace bowler vulnerable to injury. Intrinsic factors found to be associated with both lower quarter injury and performance should be appropriately incorporated into injury prevention programmes in order to prevent the occurrence of injuries in the presence of the high load nature of the pace bowling action. Further research needs to be conducted on the effectiveness of these injury prevention programmes to prevent injury amongst pace bowlers...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{has shown}} that {{children}} have lower anaerobic capacity and oxidize more lipids during aerobic activity com-pared with adults. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effects of age on the activity of marker enzymes for anaerobic and aerobic metabolism in human skeletal muscle from relatively sedentary children and adults. The m. obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> was analyzed for anaerobic [creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ] and aerobic (carnitine palmitoyltransferase and 2 -oxoglutarate dehydroge-nase) enzyme activities in 32 male individuals. The subjects were divided into two groups: children (3 – 11 y; n 20) and adults (29 – 54 y; n 12). LDH activity was higher in adults (118. 2 20. 1) compared with children (27. 8 10. 1) mol · min 1 · g 1 wet weight (p 0. 0002). Creatine kinase activity was 28 % (p 0. 0003) lower in children than in adults, and adenylate kinase activity was 20 % (p 0. 006) lower in children than in adults. In addition, we found higher 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in adults compared with children (p 0. 04), with no effect of age on carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity (NS). When samples were expressed relative to protein content, only LDH activity remained significantly lower in children compared with adults (p 0. 0001). In conclusion, the lower LDH activity observed in children compared with adults may partially explain decreased anaerobic and lactate generation capacity of the children studied. However, the mechanisms for the relatively deficient anaerobic enzyme activities of children are not clear. (Pediatr Res 57...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{abdominal}} muscles in trunk rotation is not comprehensively understood. This study investigated the electromyographic (EMG) activity of anatomically distinct regions of {{the abdominal}} muscles during trunk rotation in six subjects with no history of spinal pain. Fine-wire electrodes were inserted into the right abdominal wall; upper region of transversus abdominis (TrA), middle region of TrA, obliquus <b>internus</b> <b>abdominis</b> (OI) and obliquus externus abdominis (OE), and lower region of TrA and OI. Surface electrodes were placed over right rectus abdominis (RA). Subjects performed trunk rotation {{to the left and}} right in sitting by rotating their pelvis relative to a fixed thorax. EMG activity was recorded in relaxed supine and sitting, and during an isometric hold at end range. TrA was consistently active during trunk rotation, with the recruitment patterns of the upper fascicles opposite to that of the middle and lower fascicles. During left rotation, there was greater activity of the lower and middle regions of contralateral TrA and the lower region of contralateral OI. The upper region of ipsilateral TrA and OE were predominately active during right rotation. In contrast, {{there was no difference in}} activity of RA and middle OI between directions (although middle OI was different between directions for all but one subject). This study indicates that TrA is active during trunk rotation, but this activity varies between muscle regions. These normative data will assist in understanding the role of TrA in lumbopelvic control and movement, and the effect of spinal pain on abdominal muscle recruitment...|$|R
40|$|Transversus <b>abdominis</b> (TA), obliquus <b>internus</b> (OI), and obliquus externus (OE) are {{involved}} in multiple functions: breathing, control of trunk orientation, and stabilization of the pelvis and spine. How these functions are coordinated has received limited attention. We studied electromyographic (EMG) activity of right-sided muscles and 3 -dimensional moments during treadmill walking at six different speeds (1. 4 – 5. 4 km/h) in sixteen healthy young women. PCA revealed time series of trunk moments to be consistent across speeds and subjects though somewhat less in the sagittal plane. All three muscles were active during ⩾ 75 % of the stride cycle, indicative of a stabilizing function. Clear phasic modulations were observed, with TA more active during ipsilateral, and OE during contralateral swing, while OI activity was largely symmetrical. Fourier analysis revealed four main frequencies in muscle activity: respiration, stride frequency, step frequency, and a triphasic pattern. With increasing speed, the absolute power of all frequencies remained constant or increased; the relative power of respiration and stride-related activities decreased, while that of step-related activity and the triphasic pattern increased. Effects of speed were gradual, and EMG linear envelopes had considerable common variance (> 70 %) across speeds within subjects, suggesting that the same functions were performed at all speeds. Maximum cross-correlations between moments and muscle activity were 0. 2 – 0. 6, and further analyses in the time domain revealed both simultaneous and consecutive task execution. To deal with conflicting constraints, {{the activity of the}} three muscles was clearly coordinated, with co-contraction of antagonists to offset unwanted mechanical side-effects of each individual muscle...|$|R
