25|$|Although Ronsard {{attempted}} a long epic poem {{of the origins}} of the French monarchy entitled La Franciade (modeled on Virgil and Homer), this experiment was largely judged a failure, and he remains most remembered today for his various collections of Amours (<b>or</b> <b>love</b> poems), Odes and Hymnes.|$|E

25|$|According to Givens (1999), {{the process}} of nonverbal {{communication}} or negotiation is to send and receive messages {{in an attempt to}} gain someone’s approval <b>or</b> <b>love.</b> Courtship, which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication gestures to tell each other to come nearer and nearer until we touch. Essential signals in the path to intimacy include facial nuzzles, kissing and caressing each other.|$|E
25|$|Ogawa {{questioned}} {{the transition from}} epic songs to lyric songs. He suggested the possibility that both types of songs had co-existed for a long time. The most critical weakness of his hypothesis {{is the lack of}} attested lyric songs from earlier times. He attempted to explain this by their extemporaneous nature: lyric songs, <b>or</b> <b>love</b> songs in particular, must have been quickly replaced while people had a strong incentive to preserve epic songs.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{suggest that}} Caligula was {{motivated}} by more than mere lust <b>or</b> <b>love</b> in pursuing intimate relationships with his sisters, thinking instead, {{that he may have}} decided deliberately to pattern the Roman lineage after the Hellenistic monarchs of the Ptolemaic dynasty where marriages between jointly ruling brothers and sisters had become tradition rather than sex scandals. This also has been used to explain why his despotism apparently was more evident to his contemporaries than those of Augustus and Tiberius.|$|E

25|$|Most nouns have {{singular}} and plural numbers. There {{are some}} words that have only singular (e.g., pienas – milk, auksas – gold, gripas – flu, laimė – happiness) or only plural (e.g., lubos – ceiling, miltai – flour, kelnės – trousers) forms. Most such words are abstract (i.e., represent concepts like luck <b>or</b> <b>love</b> and not tangible {{things such as}} table or house), describe material or name a disease. However, in some instances, for example poetic language, {{it is possible to}} use singular nouns in plural form.|$|E
25|$|Socrates asks {{questions}} of Agathon: has {{he referred to}} the object of love, <b>or</b> <b>love</b> itself? Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.|$|E

25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration <b>or</b> <b>love</b> to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Limerence is {{characterized}} by intrusive thinking and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense joy or as extreme despair, {{depending on whether the}} feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned passion <b>or</b> <b>love,</b> {{even to the point of}} addictive-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.|$|E
25|$|Love, a theme {{throughout}} the Divine Comedy, {{is particularly important}} for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While the love that flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) <b>or</b> <b>love</b> that is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from {{the church and the}} Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional Court of Colombia {{has issued}} {{statements}} that protect {{the right of}} homosexuals and bisexuals to express themselves in public, {{including the right to}} express affection <b>or</b> <b>love</b> for their partners. In 1994, the Court disapproved the National Council of Television's refusing to show a commercial which featured a same-sex couple. This statement was followed by others as the T-268 of 2000, where the Court disapproved of the mayor of Neiva for preventing a gay parade; the T-301 of 2004, which ordered the Santa Marta police to stop harassing homosexuals who visited the boardwalk of the city; the T-314 of 2011, which analyzed the Tequendama Hotel's refusal to allow access to some homosexuals to two events that were held in its facilities. In that ruling, the Court urged the Government to create a national policy that takes into account the LGBTI community.|$|E
25|$|Although cheek kissing is not {{as widely}} practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as {{in other parts of}} Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is commonplace, however a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some {{dependant}} on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship <b>or</b> <b>love.</b> Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.|$|E
