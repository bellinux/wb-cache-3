5|$|Zwingli {{was obliged}} to state {{the terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Laffoon {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. {{to live with}} his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. There he served as a {{messenger}} in the office of Judge C. R. Faulkner, director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> office. In September 1887, he enrolled at Columbia Law School (asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School). On October 17, 1888, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a law degree in 1890. He returned to Madisonville, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost. He became active in the Democratic Party and served as a county election officer. In 1892, he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley. In 1894, he ran for the office of county attorney for Hopkins County, but lost to Roy Salmon by seventeen votes.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E

25|$|The TWU, for its part, later {{claimed that}} it was forced to strike {{in order to prevent}} the MTA from raising the {{retirement}} age, rather than striking to reduce the retirement age. That was not the case, however, because it is state legislation that sets the terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> plan, and under state law pension terms may not even be the subject of collective bargaining. Years after the strike the pension plan remains retirement at age 55 after 25 years worked. And as a result of past underfunding, due to optimistic rate of return assumptions, and other pension enhancements that benefitted the TWU, such a retroactive inflation adjustment for retirees and an end to employee contributions, the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> plan to New York City Transit soared from $468 million in FY 2005 to $770 million in FY 2010 with a projected $950 million in pension costs forecast for FY 2014.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lays, his wife and unmarried daughters, had retired to Ingrandes in the Loire valley, where they joined his married daughter Marie-Cécile. Here he had already witnessed the death of his son Bertrand from consumption and was soon to see his wife stricken with paralysis. In his final years Lays spent his time singing hymns in local churches. He died aged 73 in 1831, leaving his wife and children the paltry sum of 1056 francs.|$|E

25|$|When Republican France overran the Dutch Republic in 1795, Collaert {{joined the}} army of the new Batavian Republic on 8 July as a {{lieutenant}} colonel of the Hussar Regiment. During the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, he fought at the Battle of Castricum on 6 October where he distinguished himself. Two days later his hussars captured 200 British soldiers near Petten. In the 1800 campaign on the Main River, he was under the command of Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau and received two serious wounds while leading two squadrons of hussars against an Habsburg Austrian sortie from Aschaffenburg on 23 November. On that occasion he won a glowing report from Pierre Augereau and a sword of honor from his government. He was promoted colonel of the 1st Batavian Hussar Regiment on 18 July 1803.

25|$|The Second Sickness Insurance Modification Law {{linked the}} {{indexation}} of the income-limit for compulsory employee coverage {{to the development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> insurance contribution ceiling (75% of the ceiling), obliged employers to pay half of the contributions {{in the case of}} voluntary membership, extended the criteria for voluntary membership of employees, and introduced preventive medical check-ups for certain groups. The Law on Sickness Insurance for Farmers (1972) included the self-employed, their dependants and people who receive old age assistance in sickness insurance. The Law on the Social Insurance of Disabled Persons (1975) included in sickness and pension insurance disabled persons employed in workshops and institutions under certain conditions, while a law was passed in June that year to include all students in statutory sickness insurance. Social protection against the risks of an occupational accident, death, disability, and old age was newly regulated in 1974 through a Civil Servant Provisioning Law that was standard throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1808, after having been {{rejected}} for a position at the royal theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia, for a well-paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel. To persuade {{him to stay in}} Vienna, the Archduke Rudolph, Prince Kinsky and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from the composer's friends, pledged to pay Beethoven a pension of 4000 florins a year. Only Archduke Rudolph paid his share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> on the agreed date. Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and soon died after falling from his horse. Lobkowitz stopped paying in September 1811. No successors came forward to continue the patronage, and Beethoven relied mostly on selling composition rights and a small pension after 1815. The effects of these financial arrangements were undermined to some extent by war with France, which caused significant inflation when the government printed money to fund its war efforts.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical contribution to <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> overlapping-generations general equilibrium modelling, i. e. an upgrade of this branch of models with a <b>pension</b> system. Within <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> block we model both <b>the</b> first <b>pension</b> pillar, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the fully-funded second pillar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovenian <b>pension</b> system. <b>The</b> modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>pension</b> pillar {{is based on}} cash flows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandatory <b>pension</b> insurance institution, <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> base and <b>the</b> <b>pension,</b> and <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> harmonising <b>pension</b> growth to wage growth. <b>The</b> modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second pillar centres on implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidity constraint.

25|$|In {{the pension}} industry, actuarial methods {{are used to}} measure the costs of {{alternative}} strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pension</b> and benefit arrangements, collective bargaining; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States.|$|E
