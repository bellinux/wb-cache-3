Both the theory and experiment show that the symmetry of the DOP is maintained for the orthogonal polarizations under both first and higher-order PMD, whereas the symmetry of eye-closure penalty is broken under second-order PMD. As a result, an orthogonal polarization pair can have large disparity of eye-closure penalty despite an identical degree-of-polarization. We also demonstrate a novel approach to estimate the maximum eye-closure penalty asymmetry with three orthogonal polarizations on the Poincare Sphere.

Lifting the valley degeneracy is therefore an attractive route for achieving valley polarization. It is very challenging to achieve appreciable valley degeneracy splitting with applied magnetic field. We propose a strategy to create giant splitting of the valley degeneracy by proximity-induced Zeeman effect. As a demonstration, our first principles calculations of monolayer MoTe$_ 2 $ on a EuO substrate show that valley splitting over 300 meV can be generated. The proximity coupling also makes interband transition energies valley dependent, enabling valley selection by optical frequency tuning in addition to circular polarization. The valley splitting in the heterostructure is also continuously tunable by rotating substrate magnetization. The giant and tunable valley splitting adds a readily accessible dimension to the valley-spin physics with rich and interesting experimental consequences, and offers a practical avenue for exploring device paradigms based on the intrinsic degrees of freedom of electrons.
