The initial membership <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> periods to the market of mandatory private pension funds lasted four months, {{taking place in the}} period  September, 17, 2007 – January 17, 2008. At the end, 4, 156, 316 people were registered to the 18 pension funds initially authorized of which 322 706 participants were randomly assigned. In this article we propose an analysis of how it evolved the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in Pillar II of mandatory private pensions in Romania in the period following the initial accession, following these aspects: total number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> enrolled in the Register, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> with individual contributions, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> with contributions paid in the current month, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> with contributions paid in the current month, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> without contributions, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> randomly assigned, the number <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in Pillar II grouped by age and by gender.

For each statement, the respondent should choose one of the following options, according to his/her opinion about it: “totally disagree,” “strongly disagree,” “partially disagree,” “neutral,” “partially agree,” “strongly agree,” and “totally agree.” In this context, seven metrics were proposed: (M 1) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “totally disagree” option, (M 2) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “strongly disagree” option, (M 3) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “partially disagree” option, (M 4) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “neutral” option, (M 5) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “partially agree” option, (M 6) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “strongly agree” option, and (M 7) percentage <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> that assigned the “totally agree” option.

25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E
