Touching or moving the outer ear increases the pain, and this maneuver on physical exam {{is important in}} establishing the clinical diagnosis. It {{may be difficult to}} see the eardrum with an <b>otoscope</b> at the initial examination because of narrowing of the ear canal from inflammation and the presence of drainage and debris. Sometimes the diagnosis of external otitis is presumptive and return visits are required to fully examine the ear.

5000|$|An <b>otoscope</b> or {{auriscope}} is {{a medical}} device {{which is used to}} look into the ears. Health care providers use otoscopes to screen for illness during regular check-ups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An <b>otoscope</b> potentially gives a view of the ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Because the eardrum is the border separating the external ear canal from the middle ear, its characteristics can be indicative of various diseases of the middle ear space. The presence of cerumen (ear wax), shed skin, pus, canal skin edema, foreign body, and various ear diseases can obscure any view of the eardrum and thus severely compromise the value of otoscopy done with a common <b>otoscope.</b> [...] The most commonly used otoscopes consist of a handle and a head. The head contains a light source and a simple low-power magnifying lens, typically around 8 diopters (3.00x Mag). The distal (front) end of the <b>otoscope</b> has an attachment for disposable plastic ear specula. The examiner first straightens the ear canal by pulling on the pinna and then inserts the ear speculum side of the <b>otoscope</b> into the external ear. It is important to brace the hand holding the <b>otoscope</b> against the patient's head to avoid injury to the ear canal by placing the index finger or little finger against the head. The examiner can then look through a lens on the rear of the instrument and see inside the ear canal. In many models, the lens can be removed, which allows the examiner to insert instruments through the <b>otoscope</b> into the ear canal, such as for removing earwax (cerumen). Most models also have an insertion point for a bulb capable of pushing air through the speculum which is called pneumatic <b>otoscope.</b> This puff of air allows an examiner to test the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E

40|$|Background : Wax in {{ear canal}} causes a {{sizeable}} burden on resources {{of health services}} to a country. Aim : The magnitude of impacted wax, its effect in a survey and cost of managing this problem were reviewed in 2002. Settings and Designs : A study was conducted during 1996 to estimate the magnitude and causes of hearing impairment and ear diseases in Oman. The authors further reviewed the data of community-based prevalence study to assess the role of impacted wax. Materials and Methods: Trained physicians used portable audiometers to test the hearing status of each ear. They used <b>otoscopes</b> to examine the ear. Persons suspected to have hearing impairment or ear disease were reexamined by audiologists and otologists to determine the causes of hearing impairment. The resources for managing impacted wax were also calculated. Results : In this survey, 11, 402 subjects of all ages were examined. Prevalence of impacted wax was 11. 7 &#x 0025; (CI 95 &#x 0025; 11. 1 - 12. 2). Impacted wax was significantly higher in females compared to males [RR = 1. 22 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 10 - 1. 35) ]. It was more common in residents of regions with humid environment than those of regions with less humidity [RR = 1. 91 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 67 - 2. 18) ]. Impacted wax in ear canal was associated with ear diseases. A total of 181, 000 Omani people were estimated to have impacted wax in the ear canal. Managing impacted wax could cost 3. 6 million US dollars to the ear care services. Conclusions : Impacted wax was a hindrance in the hearing survey, and countries should {{plan to deal with}} earwax in such surveys. Its impact on hearing impairment and resource burden should be considered while formulating polices for ear care...|$|R
50|$|An {{examination}} of the external ear canal and tympanic membrane performed by a medical doctor, otolaryngologist, or audiologist using an <b>otoscope,</b> a visual instrument inserted into the ear.

50|$|A Combat Medic {{may also}} carry other {{supplies}} as the mission dictates. A stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, <b>otoscope,</b> ophthalmoscope, and thermometer may help the medic treat his/her soldiers or civilians {{on the battlefield}} (COBs) while on an extended mission, as space dictates.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of medical}} {{equipment}} is routinely employed {{to conduct a}} nursing assessment. These include, the <b>otoscope,</b> thermometer, stethoscope, penlight, sphygmomanometer, bladder scanner, speculum, and eye charts. Besides the interviewing process, the nursing assessment utilizes certain techniques to collect information such as observation, auscultation, palpation and percussion.|$|E
50|$|As its typical {{symptoms}} {{overlap with}} other conditions, such as acute external otitis, clinical history {{alone is not}} sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the tympanic membrane. Examiners use a pneumatic <b>otoscope</b> with a rubber bulb attached to assess the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used otoscopes—those used in emergency rooms, pediatric offices, general practice, and by internists- are monocular devices. They provide only a two-dimensional view of the ear canal, its contents, and usually at least {{a portion of the}} eardrum, depending on what is within the ear canal and its status. Another method of performing otoscopy (visualization of the ear) is use of a binocular microscope, in conjunction with a larger metal ear speculum, with the patient supine and the head tilted, which provides a much larger field of view and the added advantages of a stable head, far superior lighting, and most importantly, depth perception. A binocular (two-eyed) view is required in order to judge depth. If wax or another material obstructs the canal and/or a view of the entire eardrum, it can easily and confidently be removed with specialized suction tips and other microscopic ear instruments, whereas the absence of depth perception with the one-eyed view of a common <b>otoscope</b> makes removal of anything more laborious and hazardous. Another major advantage of the binocular microscope is that both of the examiner's hands are free, since the microscope is suspended from a stand. The microscope has up to 40x power magnification, which allows much more detailed viewing of the entire ear canal, and of the entire eardrum unless edema of the canal skin prevents it. Subtle changes in the anatomy are much more easily detected and interpreted than with a monocular view <b>otoscope.</b> Traditionally only ENT specialists (otolaryngologists) and otologists (subspecialty ear doctors) acquire binocular microscopes and the necessary skills and training to use them, and incorporate their routine use in evaluating patient's ear complaints. Studies have shown that reliance on a monocular <b>otoscope</b> to diagnose ear disease results in a more than 50% chance of misdiagnosis, as compared to binocular microscopic otoscopy. The expense of acquiring a binocular microscope is only one obstacle to its being more widely adapted to general medicine. The low level of familiarity with binocular otoscopy among pediatric and general medicine professors in physician training programs is probably a more difficult obstacle to overcome. Thus, the standard of general otologic diagnosis and ear care remains, for the most part, the largely antiquated monocular <b>otoscope.</b>|$|E

50|$|Routine check ups usually involve {{assessment}} of weight, skin, health and teeth {{by the owner}} or a veterinarian. This is essential because a rabbit's health and welfare can be compromised by being overweight or underweight or by having dental problems. Checking the teeth is particularly {{important part of the}} examination as back teeth can only be seen with an <b>otoscope.</b> Veterinarians can also give personalized advice on diet and exercise.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the hearing}} test itself, {{the ears of}} the client are usually {{examined}} with an <b>otoscope</b> {{to make sure they}} are free of wax, that the eardrum is intact, the ears are not infected, and the middle ear is free of fluid (indicating middle ear infection). The most common reasons to develop hearing loss due to genetic disorder, ageing problems, exposure to noise pollution, infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, he {{revolutionized}} the clinical diagnosis of aural diseases by the {{inspection of the}} illuminated tympanic membrane (which led to the current <b>otoscope),</b> and developed the first illustrated atlas of the tympanic membrane in health and disease, with color drawings made by himself. Politzer also wrote {{one of the most}} outstanding and authoritative textbooks on otology of the century, the Lehrbuch der Ohrenheilkunde, in 1878. With von Troeltsch and Hermann Schwartze, he founded Archiv für Ohrenheilkunde, the first journal dedicated to ear disorders.|$|E
50|$|After an {{otoscopy}} (examination of the {{ear with}} an <b>otoscope)</b> {{to ensure that the}} path to the eardrum is clear and that there is no perforation, the test is performed by inserting the tympanometer probe in the ear canal. The instrument changes the pressure in the ear, generates a pure tone, and measures the eardrum responses to the sound at different pressures. This produces a series of data measuring how admittance varies with pressure, which is plotted as a tympanogram.|$|E
50|$|Many otoscopes used in doctors {{offices are}} {{wall-mounted}} {{while others are}} portable.
