5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text.

Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens <b>or</b> <b>even</b> hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E

5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (<b>or</b> <b>even</b> a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket.

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa <b>or</b> <b>even</b> to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
