5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband.</b> Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband,</b> {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that anti-HLA antibodies might be involved in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> herpes gestationis (HG). Accordingly, we have studied the frequency and specificity of such antibodies in 26 female patients with immunologically proven HG. In addition, to further investigate <b>the</b> potential association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> antigens in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> this disorder, we have performed HLA typing in 20 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> <b>of</b> these women. HLA-DR 2 was found in 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> (controls 25 %, p = 0. 04).

Anti-HLA antibodies were found in 85 % of women with a history of HG. Approximately 25 % of normal, multiparous women have such antibodies in their sera. In normal women, their presence has not been associated with increased fetal or maternal risk. These data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> HLA type may be associated with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> HG in <b>the</b> wife.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> a <b>husband's</b> {{job loss}} on <b>the</b> labor supply <b>of</b> his wife, an effect {{known as the}} 'added worker' effect. Unlike past added worker effect studies which focus on <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> current unemployment status, this paper analyzes the wife's labor supply response in the periods before and after her husband's job displacement {{in order to examine}} the short- and long-run adjustments to an earnings shock. Using <b>the</b> Panel Study <b>of</b> Income Dynamics, small pre-displacement effects are found along with larger and persistent post-displacement effects. <b>The</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wives' responses differs by <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> displacement (plant closing vs. permanent layoff), possibly due to differences in the information wives acquire prior to the displacement. In addition, the response is found to increase with <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> wage loss, to have changed over time (70 's vs. 80 's) and to vary by <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> pre-displacement earnings. <b>The</b> long-run increases in the wife's labor supply account for over 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> lost income. ...|$|R

50|$|Another mystery behind <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message is <b>the</b> {{connection}} it {{may or may}} {{not have}} to The Wife’s Lament and Exeter Book Riddle 60. The Wife’s Lament and <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message are similar in style and mood. Some Anglo-Saxon scholars link the two poems on grounds that both treat a separation of lovers, but there is no conclusive evidence to link them together, only by their modern titles and their similar styles. The connection to Riddle 60 could be more convincing only because Riddle 60 is directly before <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message. Lines 49-50 <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message speak <b>of</b> a rune-stave, which is used as a sense of personification. This idea of personification is used in Riddle 60, and the object which is being personified is a tree or plant. Due to <b>the</b> connection <b>of</b> personification of a tree or plant, have argued that Riddle 60 is <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message, but <b>the</b> consensus view is that they are separate texts. <b>The</b> 17 lines <b>of</b> Riddle 60 do not contain the contradictions that are found in <b>the</b> other riddles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Exeter Book which are seemingly meant to confound the reader.|$|R
