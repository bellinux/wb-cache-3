5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, there was {{considerable}} discussion about the role <b>of</b> the <b>arts</b> in public <b>education,</b> but little data about the status <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in all schools in Minnesota. To answer this need, the Perpich Center for <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> launched The Minnesota <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> Research Project during the 2010 / 2011 school year with funding provided by the Minnesota State Legislature through its Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund of the Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment. The purpose of this project was to gather, evaluate and disseminate quantitative data regarding <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in the state. The Research Project was designed to document <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in every school through a statewide voluntary survey, and combine the survey findings with other information to create a 360 -degree view <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> in the state.

25|$|Classical {{training}} was rooted out <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in Western Europe (and the Americas) by 1970 and the classical variants of the 20th century were marginalized {{in the history}} of modernism. But classicism continued as the foundation <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in the Soviet academies until 1990, providing a foundation for expressive figurative art throughout eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East. By the year 2000, the European classical tradition retains a wide appeal to the public but awaits an educational tradition to revive its contemporary development.|$|E
25|$|As {{head of the}} Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane {{tried to}} reform it along more {{practical}} lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the Board of Education, who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan. Spencer brought in Lethaby to head its school of design and {{several members of the}} Art Workers' Guild as teachers. Ten years after reform, a committee of inquiry reviewed the RCA and found that it was still not adequately training students for industry. In the debate that followed the publication of the committee's report, C.R.Ashbee published a highly critical essay, Should We Stop Teaching Art, in which he called for the system <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> to be completely dismantled and for the crafts to be learned in state-subsidised workshops instead. Lewis Foreman Day, an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, took a different view in his dissenting report to the committee of inquiry, arguing for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials. Nevertheless, the Arts and Crafts ethos thoroughly pervaded British art schools and persisted, {{in the view of the}} historian <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> Stuart MacDonald, until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|His {{education}} {{was interrupted by}} a stint in the military from 1943 to 1945. The following year found Waddell back in Chicago attending the School of the Art Institute and then the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill. In 1947, his teaching career resumed and he taught at the YMCA Adult Education Program in Chicago until 1954. He moved to Evansville in 1955, this time teaching at the National College of Education. From 1955 to 1957, Waddell served as head <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> at the Illinois Institute of Technology before relocating to the Southwest where he became head the Art Education school at Arizona State University (at that time Arizona State College). In 1964 he resigned from that academic position to devote all his time and energy to his sculpture.|$|E

2500|$|Arts and Crafts {{practitioners}} in Britain were {{critical of the}} government system <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should {{pay more attention to}} the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed. The first school to make this change was the Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts, which [...] "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'" [...] Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of Henry Payne and Joseph Southall, the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.|$|E

2500|$|However {{it was the}} {{appointment}} of Edward R. Taylor to the headmastership of the Birmingham School of Art in 1877 that was {{to lead to the}} ideology and aesthetic of the Arts and Crafts Movement becoming the dominant feature in Birmingham's visual culture. Taylor and the school's chairman John Henry Chamberlain persuaded William Morris to accept {{the appointment}} as the school's President for two years from 1878 – the start of a 20-year relationship between Morris and the school that saw him act as lecturer and examiner, and as a commissioner of work from the school's students. In 1881 Birmingham became the first art school to incorporate Morris's ideas into its teaching introducing the then-revolutionary principle of teaching techniques of design and manufacture together. Instead of just drawing their designs on paper, Birmingham students executed them as finished products in the materials for which they were intended. [...] In 1883 the school broke completely from the control of the national system <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> with its rigidly prescribed systems of theoretical instruction controlled from South Kensington, and became the first British art school to establish itself fully under local municipal control.|$|E
2500|$|Gropius was not {{necessarily}} against Expressionism, and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this [...] "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery," [...] described [...] "painting and sculpture rising to heaven {{out of the hands}} of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." [...] By 1923 however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring Romanesque cathedrals and the craft-driven aesthetic of the [...] "Völkisch movement", instead declaring [...] "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars." [...] Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called Bauhaus and a series of books called [...] "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.|$|E

60|$|You {{will not}} expect me, within the compass of this lecture, {{to give you}} any {{analysis}} of the many kinds of excellent art (in all the three great divisions) which the complex demands of modern life, and yet more varied instincts of modern genius, have developed for pleasure or service. It must be my endeavour, in conjunction with my colleagues in other Universities, hereafter to enable you to appreciate these worthily; {{in the hope that}} also the members of the Royal Academy, and those of the Institute of British Architects, may be induced to assist, and guide, the efforts of the Universities, by organizing such a system <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> for their own students, as shall in future prevent the waste of genius in any mistaken endeavours; especially removing doubt as to the proper substance and use of materials; and requiring compliance with certain elementary principles of right, in every picture and design exhibited with their sanction. It is not indeed possible for talent so varied as that of English artists to be compelled into the formalities of a determined school; but it must certainly be the function of every academical body to see that their younger students are guarded from what must in every school be error; and that they are practised in the best methods of work hitherto known, before their ingenuity is directed to the invention of others.|$|E

Discovery.--How {{are we to}} get our men of genius: that is to say, by what means may {{we produce}} among us, at any given time, the {{greatest}} quantity of effective art-intellect? A wide question, you say, involving an account of all the best means <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Yes, but I {{do not mean to}} go into the consideration of those; I want only to state the few principles which lie at the foundation of the matter. Of these, the first is that you have always to find your artist, not to make him; you can't manufacture him, any more than you can manufacture gold. You can find him, and refine him: you dig him out as he lies nugget-fashion in the mountain-stream; you bring him home; and you make him into current coin, or household plate, but not one grain of him can you originally produce. A certain quantity of art-intellect is born annually in every nation, greater or less according to the nature and cultivation of the nation, or race of men; but a perfectly fixed quantity annually, not increasable by one grain. You may lose it, or you may gather it; you may let it lie loose in the ravine, and buried in the sands, or you may make kings' thrones of it, and overlay temple gates with it, as you choose: but {{the best you can do}} with it is always merely sifting, melting, hammering, purifying--never creating.|$|E
60|$|Is this, then, {{what you}} want? You are going {{straight}} at it at present; and I {{have only to}} ask under what limitations I am to conceive or describe your final success? Or shall there be no limitations? There are none to your powers; every day puts new machinery at your disposal, and increases, with your capital, the vastness of your undertakings. The changes {{in the state of}} this country are now so rapid, that it would be wholly absurd to endeavour to lay down laws <b>of</b> <b>art</b> <b>education</b> for it under its present aspect and circumstances; and therefore I must necessarily ask, how much of it do you seriously intend within the next fifty years to be coal-pit, brickfield, or quarry? For the sake of distinctness of conclusion, I will suppose your success absolute: that from shore to shore the whole of the island is to be set as thick with chimneys as the masts stand in the docks of Liverpool: and there shall be no meadows in it; no trees; no gardens; only a little corn grown upon the housetops, reaped and threshed by steam: that you do not leave even room for roads, but travel either over the roofs of your mills, on viaducts; or under their floors, in tunnels: that, the smoke having rendered the light of the sun unserviceable, you work always by the light of your own gas: that no acre of English ground shall be without its shaft and its engine; and therefore, no spot of English ground left, on which it shall be possible to stand, without a definite and calculable chance of being blown off it, at any moment, into small pieces.|$|E
