40|$|Carba{{porphyrin}}s are porphyrin analogs {{where one}} or more pyrrole units are replaced with a carbocyclic ring. Benziporphyrins are porphyrin analogues with a 1, 3 -phenylene unit replacing one of the pyrrole subunits. Because of cross-conjugation, benziporphyrins are not aromatic species. However, protonation of benziporphyrins can afford some aromatic characteristics. Although the synthesis of many examples of monocarbaporphyrins have been successfully executed, no examples of porphyrinoids with pyrene subunits have been prepared. Pyrene-containing porphyrinoids, which have been named as pyreniporphyrins, are theoretically significant molecules that provide insights into the aromaticity and reactivity of porphyrinoid systems. In this thesis, two projects were conducted to explore the synthesis, reactivity, aromaticity, and coordination chemistry of pyreniporphyrins.

These complexes undergo an intramolecular cyclization reaction in methanolic solution to form the corresponding cis β <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivative</b> containing a seven-membered metallacycle, by replacement of the Cl atom of the axial CH 2 Cl by the salen phenolate oxygen. The cyclization rate increases on going from two to four methyl substituents in the chelate, {{in agreement with the}} electrochemical data that evidence a general shift toward more negative values with {{an increase in the number}} of methyl substituents. The cyclization rate is also affected by the substituent position, and both electrochemical and kinetic data evidence a remarkable influence of the methyls on the −C═N– groups of the chelate. The X-ray structures of cyclized complexes, [CoIII(chelCH 2) (py) (H 2 O) ]+, show a dependence of the conformation of the seven-membered metallacycle on the different positions of substituents in the chelate. In fact, in the complex having methyls on the −C═N– groups, the conformation is characterized by having the methylene carbon atom significantly displaced (ca. 1. 26 Å) from the aromatic ring plane, whereas in the complex lacking methyl groups in those positions, the atoms of the Ph–O–CH 2 fragment are coplanar. The standard Gibbs energies obtained by quantum chemical calculation reveal that the different conformations observed in the solid state are mainly the result of the energetically unfavorable setup of the methyls on the −C═N– groups and of the energetically favorable displacement of the CH 2 group out of plane of the aromatic ring. 1 H NMR data suggest that the different conformations of the metallacycle are, at least partially, retained in solution...|$|E

Acidolysis and homolysis;The {{reactivity}} of several pentaaquo-(alpha) -hydroxyalkylchromium(III) complexes including (H(, 2) O) (, 5) CrCH(C(, 2) H(, 5)) OH(2 ̆ 72 +), CrC(CH(, 3)) (C(, 2) H(, 5)) OH(2 ̆ 72 +), CrC(C(, 2) H(, 5)) (, 2) OH(2 ̆ 72 +), CrC(CH(, 3)) (i-C(, 3) H(, 7)) OH(2 ̆ 72 +) and CrC(CH(, 3)) (t-C(, 4) H(, 9)) OH(2 ̆ 72 +) was examined. The chromium-carbon bond {{was found to}} cleave by both heterolytic and homolytic pathways. The heterolytic pathway, in general termed acidolysis, is the common mode of decomposition of most pentaaquoalkylchromium(III) complexes. The products of acidolysis are such that the reaction may be formally viewed as the protonation of the carbanion bonded to chromium(III). The homolytic pathway was studied {{through the use of}} oxidizing scavengers which reacted with the products of homolysis (Cr(2 ̆ 72 +) and R(.)), but not directly with the alkylchromium(III) complexes. Thus, by proper selection of reaction conditions, rate constants for both pathways were determined. In most cases, the homolysis rate constants were much greater in magnitude than the acidolysis values. The homolysis rate constants were found to be strongly influenced by steric effects. At 25. 0 (DEGREES) C, the rate constants varied (TURN) 10 (2 ̆ 77) with CrCH(, 2) OH(2 ̆ 72 +) (k(,hom) = 3. 7 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 5) s(2 ̆ 7 - 1)), the least substituted complex having the slowest homolysis rate and CrC(CH(, 3)) (t-C(, 4) H(, 9)) OH(2 ̆ 72 +) (k(,hom) (TURN) 3 x 10 (2 ̆ 72) s(2 ̆ 7 - 1)) having the fastest homolysis rate;One (alpha) -alkoxyalkylchromium(III) complex, CrC(CH(, 3)) (, 2) OCH(CH(, 3)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 72 +), was also studied.

The predominant pathway for reactions with both oxidants was found to be inversely dependent on the acid concentration in the range studied. Two different mechanisms are proposed to explain the results obtained. The Cu(2 ̆ 72 +) reactions occur by binding of Cu(2 ̆ 72 +) to the (alpha) -hydroxyl oxygen in its basic form. The Fe(2 ̆ 73 +) reactions probably proceed through attack directly at the chromium center;Part II.

40|$|This {{volume is}} the 50 th {{book in the}} two Sigels' series (44 in MIBS and 6 in MILS) and this is celebrated with a compre­hensive Author Index given {{at the end of}} this Volume 6. Supported by nearly 1700 {{references}} and about 160 illustrations (many in color), Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors highlights the function of these metal-carbon bonds in life, but also their importance in research. Written by 20 internationally recognized experts, 12 stimulating chapters provide an authoritative and timely resource for scientists working in the wide range from physical and inorganic biochemistry all the way through to physiology and medicine. This volume is devoted to naturally occurring metal-carbon bonds, a topic recently obtaining (again) significant momentum, largely – but not only – due to new insights gained with hydrogenases. The field started out about 50 years ago when coenzyme B 12 was identified as <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivative</b> of vitamin B 12. This moved the cobalt-carbon bond into the center of interest and consequently, the first two chapters of this book are devoted to the organometallic chemistry of B 12 coenzymes and to the biochemistry of cobalamin- and corrinoid-dependent enzymes. B 12 coenzymes are required in the metabolism of a broad range of organisms including humans; however, only microorganisms have the ability to biosynthesize B 12 and other natural corrinoids. This fact alone, together with new metabolic insights (e. g., riboswitches), guarantees a continued fascination – not only for the B 12 community. Related to Co-corrin, the Ni-porphinoid unit (F 430) is the prosthetic group of methyl-coenzyme M reductase. This enzyme, the topic of Chapter 3, catalyzes the methane-forming step in methanogenic archaea and most probably also the methane-oxidizing step in methanotrophic archaea. Chapter 4 deals with acetyl-coenzyme A synthases/carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, i. e., bifunctional nickel-containing enzymes, which catalyze the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and the reversible reduction of CO 2 to CO in anaerobic, mostly thermophilic, organisms, able to grow chemiauto­trophically on simple inorganic compounds like CO 2. Ni-C bonds with methyl, acetyl, carbonyl, and carboxylate groups are evidenced. [NiFe]-, [FeFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenases are detailed in the next three chapters. These enzymes, present in many microorganisms, catalyze the oxidation of molecular hydrogen or the reduction of protons. All of them have a Fe(CO) x unit in their active site. Iron-cyanide units occur in [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases. However, despite the indicated similarities they clearly have independent evolutionary origins. The participation of the commonly considered toxic ligands CO and CN– in the active sites of hydrogenases is still a surprise to many; yet, exactly their occurrence incites a great interest in physical chemists as well as evolutionary biologists. The dual role of heme as cofactor and substrate in the biosynthesis of carbon monoxide is the topic of Chapter 8. Carbon monoxide is a ubiquitous molecule in the atmosphere but it is also produced in mammalian, plastidic, and bacterial cells as a byproduct in the catalytic cycle of heme degradation as catalyzed by the enzyme heme oxygenase. Most fascinating is the fact that the biological role of CO spans the range from toxic to cytoprotective, depending on its concentration. CO generated by heme oxygenase is now known to function in several important physiological processes, including vasodilation, apoptosis, inflammation, and possibly neurotransmission. The relevance of the copper-carbon bond in biological inorganic chemistry will probably not easily come to the mind of most biochemical and inorganic researchers. However, there is a vast amount of literature, cunningly presented in Chapter 9. CO as well as CN– have proven very useful in obtaining insights into the active site structures and mechanisms of copper proteins. Naturally, in these instances both ligands are inhibitors and used as probes. However, there is also the recently described copper-carbon unit present in a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, which contains a novel molybdenum-copper catalytic site, or the copper(I) -arene unit, which was evidenced in a bacterial copper chaperone. Apparently also a plant receptor site (ETR 1) utilizes Cu(I) to sense the growth hormone ethylene. Chapter 10 focuses on the interaction of CN– with enzymes containing vanadium, manganese, non-heme iron, and zinc, and the inhibiting properties of this ligand, allowing its use as a probe. The reaction mechanism of the molybdenum hydroxylase xanthine oxidoreductase is revisited in Chapter 11; previously a molybdenum-carbon bond was postulated but now proof is presented against its formation. The terminating Chapter 12 reviews briefly the most popular computational approaches employed in theoretical studies of bioorganometallic species by providing detailed examples...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivatives</b> of titanium and zirconium bearing two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl groups as ancillary ligands {{has proven to}} be rich and varied, whereas that for hafnium is still in its formative stages. Derivatives of permethyltitanocene, permethylzirconocene, and permethylhafnocene offer a number of advantages over their (η 5 -C 5 H 5) analogs. Generally, they exhibit higher thermal stability, solubility, and crystallinity. Furthermore, the steric bulk of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group discourages oligomerization through singleatom bridges (H, O, N), thus rendering permethylmetallocene derivatives monomeric. Such properties have facilitated the development of a rich and diverse reaction chemistry for compounds of the group 4 transition metals with pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ancillary ligands...|$|R

Palladium-catalysed coupling reactions currently represent {{the most efficient}} methods to prepare such (hetero) arylated selenophene derivatives. Initially, Stille coupling was the most efficient reaction for the synthesis of these compounds; however, over the last decade, Suzuki coupling {{has become the most}} commonly employed. Recently, Pd-catalysed arylation via the C-H bond activation of selenophenes {{has proved to be a}} very convenient alternative method for the preparation of several arylated selenophenes as there is no need to prepare <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivatives.</b> In this Review, the progress and substrate scope in the synthesis of both C 2 -and C 3 -arylated selenophenes via Pd-catalysis are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Highly selective, narcissistic self-sorting {{has been}} {{observed}} in the one-pot synthesis of three organometallic molecular cylinders of type [M 3 {L-(NHC) 3 } 2](PF 6) 3 (M=Ag+, Au+; L= 1, 3, 5 -benzene, triphenylamine, or 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene) from L-(NHC) 3 and silver(I) or gold(I) ions. The molecular cylinders contain only one type of tris-NHC ligand with no crossover products detectable. Transmetalation of the tris-NHC ligands from Ag+ to Au+ in a one-pot reaction with retention of the supramolecular structures is also demonstrated. High-fidelity self-sorting was also observed in the one-pot reaction of benzene-bridged tris-NHC and tetrakis-NHC ligands with Ag 2 O. This study {{for the first time}} extends narcissistic self-sorting in metal–ligand interactions from Werner-type complexes to <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivatives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vanadium(III) amidinate {{complexes}} (amidinate) 2 VCl and (amidinate) VCl 2 (THF) 2 {{were prepared}} for two different amidinate ligands, [PhC(NSiMe 3) 2]- and [t-BuC(Ni-Pr) 2]-. These served as precursors for amidinate V(III) alkyl and allyl derivatives. The allyl ligand in (amidinate) 2 V(allyl) is η 3 -bound, indicating that the amidinates act as four-electron anionic ligands. The 12 -electron alkyl complex [PhC(NSiMe 3) 2] 2 VMe catalyzes the slow oligomerization of ethene to linear olefins at 80 °C. The bis-allyl complex [t-BuC(Ni-Pr) 2]V(η 3 -allyl) 2 was prepared and structurally characterized, but its analogue with the [PhC(NSiMe 3) 2] ligand already decomposes around - 30 °C. This shows that the substituent pattern of the amidinate ancillary ligand can strongly affect the stability of <b>organometallic</b> <b>derivatives.</b> ...|$|R
