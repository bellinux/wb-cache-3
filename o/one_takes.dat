At the station, the troopers try {{to decide what to do}} with him, and <b>one</b> <b>takes</b> his picture. Two other deformed people enter the station, kill the troopers and take the boy.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} {{sequence of}} the books differs from the fictional chronology, with the timeframe of some books overlapping. One of the novels, Flashman and the Redskins, is in two parts: part <b>one</b> <b>takes</b> place in 1849–50, while the second covers 1875–76. Although the main series of stories finishes in 1894, Flashman lives on until 1915 and appears in his late 80s in another Fraser novel, Mr American.|$|E

5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode <b>One</b> <b>takes</b> roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food <b>one</b> <b>takes</b> in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second <b>one</b> <b>takes</b> place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
