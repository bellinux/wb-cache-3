40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design and manufacture a flat-plate heat pipe capable of showing the fluid flow, the temperature distribution throughout the device, and determining {{the rate of heat}} transfer inside the system. The application of surfaces with modified wettability in phase change heat-transfer devices, such as a heat pipe, improve their heat transfer capabilities by facilitating the boiling and condensation of a working fluid [1]. These surfaces of modified wettability grant the surface biphilic properties. The heat pipe is designed to have a replaceable surface of modified wettability. The heat pipe will contain a glass <b>viewing</b> <b>panel</b> on the top to observe the fluid flow inside the system, while a <b>viewing</b> <b>panel</b> will be on the bottom to allow for qualitative observation off the heat flow with an infrared camera. The heat transfer capabilities will be quantified with thermocouples measuring the change in temperature of the cooling chamber fluid. The heat pipe is expected to improve the hea [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{conception}} is presented {{how to improve}} the skills of students to be educated for hardware and SOC design in test related topics. We present a learning method based on using so-called living pictures [1]. The method deals with the goal, to put interactive teaching modules to the Internet {{that can be used}} in a lecture as well as for individual self-studies. The core of the teaching concept presented are JAVA-applets (interactive modules) running on any browser connected to the Internet. We call this type of applet "Living Pictures". The program for representing “living pictures ” for teaching Digital Test is written in Java 1. 3 [2]. It can be run over network, using standard browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer with Java 1. 3 runtime plug-in, or with Java 1. 3 applet viewer. The program can be used for teaching the basics of testing digital systems, test generation, fault simulation and fault diagnosis. The work window of the applet consists of three main parts: vector insertion <b>panel,</b> <b>view</b> <b>panel</b> for design schematics, <b>view</b> <b>panel</b> for displaying information.

50|$|Black-body {{radiation}} {{becomes a}} visible glow of light if {{the temperature of}} the object is high enough. The Draper point is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red, about 798 K. At 1000 K, a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity (let us call it an <b>oven),</b> <b>viewed</b> from outside, looks red; at 6000 K, it looks white. No matter how the oven is constructed, or of what material, {{as long as it is}} built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls, it will contain a good approximation to black-body radiation. The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the black-body curve. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.|$|R

5000|$|The S.E.A. Aquarium (South East Asia Aquarium) [...] was the world's largest {{aquarium}} by total water volume until {{overtaken by}} Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Hengqin, China. It contains {{a total of}} 45000000 L of water for more than 100,000 marine animals of over 800 species. The aquarium comprises 10 zones with 49 habitats. The centerpiece of the Aquarium is the Open Ocean tank with more than 18000000 L and 50,000 animals. Until 2014 when eclipsed by China's Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, it had the world's largest <b>viewing</b> <b>panel,</b> 36 m wide and 8.3 m tall, which is intended to give visitors {{the feeling of being}} on the ocean floor.|$|R
