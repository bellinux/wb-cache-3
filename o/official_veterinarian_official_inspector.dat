The recommendations regarding domestic animal vaccination, management of animals exposed to rabies, and management of animals that bite humans are the core elements of animal rabies control and human rabies prevention. These updated 2011 guidelines include the national case definition for animal rabies and clarify the role of the CDC rabies laboratory in providing confirmatory testing of suspect animals.

The Compendium {{committee}} and consultants believe these updates and revisions will aid public health <b>officials,</b> physicians, <b>veterinarians,</b> and the pet bird industry in controlling this disease in birds and in people. The 2006 Compendium provides clearer guidance to veterinary clinicians on selecting diagnostic tests, and a discussion of persistent IFA titers.

Infectious disease outbreaks reported during the last decade include Escherichia coli O 157 enteritis among schoolchildren following visits to farms and petting zoos, salmonellosis in children who attended a reptile exhibit, Coxiella burnetii infections among shopping mall patrons attending an animal birthing exhibit, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in zoo elephant handlers, and ringworm in persons showing lambs.

Between 2006 and 2008, only the serovar Choleraesuis was islolated from 24 animals, three strains isolated from domestic pigs were included. In order to detect a possible epidemiological context, the strains of Choleraesuis were characterised by macrorestriction and plasmid analysis, repetitive sequence PCR, antimicrobial testing and determining the biochemical profile. A combination of all methods enabled the identification of five epidemiological groups. Two groups were detected in the same territory but three other discriminative groups were predominant in different regions. Choleraesuis strains of the different epidemiological groups circulate in wild boar populations in the corresponding regions. However, it could be concluded that both natural barriers like mountains and artificial barriers like arterial roads may cause the separation of wild boar populations {{and as a result}} also the respective Choleraesuis organisms.

40|$|This paper aims {{to look at}} a new {{angle of}} EU sports law, namely that of the equestrian sport. In doing so the paper investigates to what extent the horse sport {{including}} the racing industry complies with EU law. Sport has for a long time been recognized as falling within the scope of EU law if connected to economic activity. Nonetheless, some national equestrian and racing federations have special rules that are more favorable to home bred horses or only allow such horses to enter a race or a class. This sounds like clear-cut discrimination from a EU law point of view, but up until now there have been no, or very few, analyses of these issues and towhat extent these special national rules could be justified (for example to safeguard the breeding of national horses which is the common justification put forward by some national racing associations). Another area, which merits attention, is that of travelling with horses (with EU passports) to sports events in the EU. The EU regulation in question requires a health certificate from an <b>official</b> <b>veterinarian</b> but how these rules are applied in practice varies. Hence {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate a new area of EU sport law, which seems to have been neglected and remained in the shadow of other sports: that of the European horse world.
