25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon <b>our</b> <b>shoulders</b> the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E
500|$|So, {{against the}} dread beast {{of pride and}} against these sevenfold brutes of {{poisonous}} vices, which strive cruelly to tear apart with their rabid teeth and virulent fangs all who are unarmed, despoiled of the cuirass of virginity and stripped of the shield of chastity, the virgins of Christ and the young champions of the church must fight with muscle and strength. Against, as it were, the ferocious legions of the barbarians, which in their troops never cease to batter the tortoise of the soldiers of Christ with the artillery of guileful fraud, the struggle must go on manfully, fought with the darts of spiritual weaponry and the iron-tipped spears of the virtues. Let us not, like timid soldiers who effeminately dread the shock {{of war and the}} call of the trumpeter, inertly offer to the ravening foe the backs of <b>our</b> <b>shoulders</b> rather than the bosses of our shields! ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{said that}} he {{believed}} {{that he would be}} remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to [...] "drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty", and that following Britain's abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that [...] "the same will never be allowed to happen here". He claimed that UDI did not mark [...] "a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia", described [...] "racial harmony in Africa" [...] as part of his agenda and condemned black nationalist activities as attempts to [...] "blackmail the British government into... handing the country over to irresponsible rule". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: [...] "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on <b>our</b> <b>shoulders...</b> In the lives of most nations there comes a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia... the first Western nation {{in the last two decades}} to say 'so far and no further'." [...] He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was [...] "a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity".|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner used similar {{methods to}} push the Don Valley Parkway project along. Engineers were {{interested}} in studying alternate routes, which Gardiner was able to prevent because [...] "councillors {{could not afford to}} stop, look and listen. Either the project was started forthwith, or the whole east end of the city will be on <b>our</b> <b>shoulders</b> like three tons of bricks." [...] Metro executive committee approved the preliminary plans one month later. When the plans were in draft, he secured section-by-section approval. The Parkway project went from proposal to approved policy in about two years, from January 1955 until February 1957.|$|E

60|$|One day, about a {{week after}} the events above narrated, we met with an {{adventure}} which well-nigh cost Jack his life, but which ultimately resulted in an important change in our manner of travelling. We were traversing an extremely beautiful country with the goods on <b>our</b> <b>shoulders,</b> having, in consequence of the increasing turbulence of the river as well as its change of direction, been compelled to abandon our canoe, and cut across the country in as straight a line as its nature would permit. But this was not easy, for the grass, which was bright green, was so long as to reach sometimes higher than <b>our</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{retrospectively}} {{reviewed the}} records of six men (seven shoulders) with neuropathic arthrop-athy of the shoulder who were referred to <b>our</b> <b>shoulder</b> service during a twenty-eight-year period (from 1969 through 1997). The etiology of the neuropathic condi-tion was syringomyelia in five patients (six shoulders) and chronic alcoholism in one patient. Five patients (six shoulders) were initially misdiagnosed, and seven oper-ative procedures that were unrelated to the etiology of the neuropathic condition were performed in four of these patients. Radiographs revealed destruction of the shoulder joint and marked resorption of the humeral head in all patients. Magnetic resonance images revealed a syrinx of the central cord {{in all of the}} patients except for the one who had chronic alcoholism...|$|R

5000|$|Cox told The Age {{that album}} was a {{collection}} of [...] "happy songs". [...] "I think it's just more of a pop album. Our last album (Lazy Highways) was possibly our most introspective album, quite a melancholy one, whereas I think {{this one is a}} bit more brasher and a little bit more upbeat, probably just more straight-out happy songs. We just felt pretty positive while we were making it and really happy with it as we were going along. I think it was the whole thing of doing it ourselves, without having people looking over <b>our</b> <b>shoulder</b> and telling us we had to have this and that on there, and constantly reinforcing that we had to sell 'x' number of units." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think we}} might have found, before the rude hand of insolent office was on <b>our</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and the staff of usurped {{authority}} brandished over our heads, that contempt of the suppliant {{is not the best}} forwarder of a suit,--that national disgrace is not the high-road to security, much less to power and greatness. Patience, indeed, strongly indicates the lore of peace; but mere love does not always lead to enjoyment. It is the power of winning that palm which insures our wearing it. Virtues have their place; and out of their place they hardly deserve the name,--they pass into the neighboring vice. The patience of fortitude and the endurance of pusillanimity are things very different, as in their principle, so in their effects.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{as a child}} being taken out on Christmas Eve to the High Street in Deal where the shops would be open very late, {{and it was the}} only time Deal children were allowed out in the evening, parents were very strict. As we would be looking at the lighted shops, and listening to the people selling their wares, a horrible growl, and a long horse's face would appear, resting on <b>our</b> <b>shoulder</b> and when one looked round, there would be a long row of teeth snapping at us with its wooden jaws. It was frightening for a child. Usually, there would be a man leading the horse, with a rope, and another covered over with sacks or blankets as the horse."

60|$|The gale had {{increased}} rather than moderated, {{and the wind}} screamed all round us with an infernal clamour. So great was its force {{that we had to}} put <b>our</b> <b>shoulders</b> against it, and bore our way through it, while the sand and gravel tingled up against our faces.|$|E
