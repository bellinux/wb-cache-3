25|$|One {{style of}} Maury known as rancio is {{produced}} when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or bonbonne and {{left out in}} the summer sun to oxidize and age. This causes many of the colour compounds and tannins in the wines to fall out, leaving a thick, dark coloured deposit in the bonbonne. This deposit is allowed to stay in the bonbonne to influence the colour and flavour of resulting vintages of wine that are aged in the container. Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large foudres <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> or sold separately as Maury Rancio.|$|E

50|$|Dewar’s {{pioneered the}} process of “marrying” the whisky in oak casks to allow the blend to age as one within the casks. After the blend is created, the whisky is {{returned}} to an <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> and aged even further to obtain a smooth, robust finish.|$|E

50|$|Maturing is very {{important}} for a good brandy, which is typically aged in <b>oak</b> <b>casks.</b> The wood used for those barrels is selected because of its ability to transfer certain aromas to the spirit. Cognac is aged only in <b>oak</b> <b>casks</b> made from wood from the Forest of Tronçais and more often from the Limousin forests.|$|R
50|$|Finishing (also {{known as}} double matured or wood-finished) is the {{procedure}} that some whiskeys undergo whereby {{the spirit is}} matured in a cask of a particular origin and then spends time in a cask of different origin (from {{a couple of months}} up to the entire maturation) Typically, the first cask is an American <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> formerly used to mature bourbon. The second cask may be one that has been used to mature some sort of fortified wine, often sherry, though sometimes port, madeira, or even wines such as red burgundy or chardonnay are used.|$|E
50|$|At {{this stage}} more water {{is added to}} reduce the {{concentration}} of alcohol from 75% to 64%. Each <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> is handmade and therefore unique, so each must be weighed before and after filling {{to determine how much}} spirit is in each. Each cask is stencilled with the name, year, cask number and number of litres. The casks are then laid aside in the warehouse for a minimum of three years when it can be used for blending. But for the malt whisky range it is matured for 8, 10, 12, 15 or 21 years or longer for very special bottlings.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to company}} legend, when Vernor left {{to serve in}} the war he had stored his {{experimental}} ginger ale syrup base in an <b>oak</b> <b>cask.</b> After returning four years later, he opened the keg and found the drink had changed through the aging process. He declared it [...] "Deliciously different," [...] which became the drink's motto. However, in a 1936 interview, son James Vernor, Jr. suggested that his father did not develop the formula until after the war, a theory confirmed by former company president James Vernor Davis in a 1962 interview. According to the 1911 trademark application on [...] "Vernor's" [...] as a name for ginger ale and extract, Vernors did not enter commerce until 1880, years after returning from the war.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{profile of}} {{volatile}} compounds and aging markers in sugar cane spirits aged for 36 months in casks made of 10 types of wood were studied. The ethanol content, volatile acidity, aldehydes, esters, higher alcohols, and methanol were determined. In addition, gallic, vanilic and syringic acids, siringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde, sinapaldehyde, vanillin, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural {{were identified and}} quantified. The profile of volatile compounds characterised aging in each type of wood. The beverage aged in <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> achieved the highest contents of maturation-related congeners. The Brazilian woods, similar to oak, were jequitibá rosa and cerejeira, which presented the highest contents of some maturation-related compounds, such as vanillin, vanilic acid, syringaldehyde and sinapaldehyde. Although oak wood conferred more chemical complexity to the beverage, Brazilian woods, singly or complementarily, present potential for spirit characterisation and for {{improving the quality of}} sugar cane spirits...|$|E
40|$|Aroma is an {{important}} property of wine {{and it can be}} influenced significantly by enological practices. The aim of this work was, by use of stir bar sorptive extraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SBSE/GC-MS), to compare semi-quantitative concentrations of the volatile constituents of stainless steel tank-fermented/matured Huxelrebe, Ortega, Schönburger and Siegerrebe varietal wines from a commercial English vineyard, with corresponding wines produced by <b>oak</b> <b>cask</b> (‘barrel’) fermentation/maturation. Aroma profiles of tank and barrel wines were different, with more volatiles detected and net concentrations being higher in barrel wines. Long chain ethyl carboxylate esters were generally more abundant in barrel wines, whereas acetate esters were generally more prominent in tank wines. By conducting a short (~ 7 month) maturation period in secondhand (third or fourth fill) casks, it was possible to make wines with more complex aromas, but without obvious oak aroma...|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of casks {{can affect the}} character of the final whisky. Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse casks that previously contained American whiskey, as US law requires several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new <b>oak</b> <b>casks.</b> To ensure continuity of supply of used <b>oak</b> <b>casks</b> some Scottish distilling groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon producers for first fill use.

The whisky {{continues}} to develop and change as it spends time in the wood, and maturation periods of twenty years or more are not uncommon.

50|$|Krug uses small 205-litre <b>oak</b> <b>casks</b> {{tailor-made}} {{from trees}} {{that are more}} than two centuries old in the forests of Hautes Futaies in Central France. Krug never use these casks immediately; during the first two or three years, they receive only second and third grape juices, with the goal of “tanning” the casks through the fermentation process, ridding them naturally of their woody aromas, making them well-seasoned and organoleptically inert. The average age of Krug <b>oak</b> <b>casks</b> is 20 years. They are retired after approximately 40 years of use.|$|R
