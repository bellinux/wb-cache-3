5|$|Landing in Oran on November 8, 1942, the 1st Infantry Division's primary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> {{to confront}} the German Afrika Korps {{commanded}} by Erwin Rommel, while its secondary <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to support Bernard Law Montgomery's advance against the Italian forces. Eventually, the 1st Infantry Division broke through the German resistance and scaled Mount Djebel. Oran fell to the Allies on November 10 and Juskalian's unit advanced east into Tunisia, reaching the Algeria–Tunisia border by January 15, 1943. There, the task force met resistance from German and Italian troops.|$|E

5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second <b>objective</b> <b>was</b> to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} between constraints and <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> straightforward: a constraint is a design target {{that must be}} met for the design to be successful. For example, a chip {{may be required to}} run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an <b>objective</b> <b>is</b> a design target where more(or less) is better. For example, yield <b>is</b> generally an <b>objective,</b> which <b>is</b> maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the {{distinction between}} constraints and <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.|$|R

5|$|Achieving her <b>objective</b> <b>was,</b> however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared}} to accept reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E
40|$|The Instructional Objective Writing Assistant (IOWA) is {{a simple}} online {{knowledge-based}} system that serves to help instructors write good course <b>objectives.</b> Instructional <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> important {{for a number of}} different reasons and yet <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> often not written, written incorrectly, or incompletely written. Instructors can use IOWA to solve the problems of absent, incorrect and incomplete <b>objectives.</b> Most <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> incorrect in that they are usually written in a form that cannot be observed or measured, thus making it impossible {{to determine whether or not}} the <b>objectives</b> have <b>been</b> met. The IOWA web site contains instructions and suggestions on how to write <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> observable and measurable. A set of <b>objectives</b> <b>is</b> incomplete if it doesn't include objectives for all levels of thinking or if the <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> focused on levels of thinking that are not appropriate for the course. The knowledge-based system, which is written in Java and posted as an applet on the IOWA web site, can help to correct this problem. The program asks the instructor questions about the course for which <b>objectives</b> <b>are</b> to be written and then returns a graph, based on the input of the instructor, that shows which levels of cognition should be focused on when writing objectives. The instructor then uses this graph, along with the suggestions, instructions, hints and examples provided on the rest of the web site, to write <b>objectives</b> that <b>are</b> correct and complete. This paper will present the motivation for creating IOWA, the knowledge upon which IOWA is based, how IOWA works, and initial results from the use of IOWA...|$|R
