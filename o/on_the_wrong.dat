5|$|Pratchett {{resisted}} {{mapping the}} Discworld {{for quite some}} time, noting that a firmly designed map restricts narrative possibility (i.e., with a map, fans would complain if he placed a building <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> street, but without one, he could adjust the geography to fit the story).|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> {{side of the}} castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching {{down to the ground}} and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> {{side of the}} road, leading to a head-on collision. His death was recorded as an accident, but {{it was confirmed that}} had he survived, he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his memoir}} (My Life), {{published}} {{after he left}} office, President Clinton said the single biggest error he made as President was not listening to Nussbaum and, instead, requesting the appointment of an Independent Counsel. He wrote: [...] "It was the worst presidential decision I ever made, <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> facts, <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> law, <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> politics, <b>wrong</b> for <b>the</b> presidency, and the Constitution."

5|$|After Christmas, Neuner won both {{individual}} races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties {{in the final}} shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. Neuner suffered {{one of the biggest}} mishaps of her career, when she fired <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> targets in the Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. She recovered quickly by winning the sprint race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double sprint and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she reached her sixth sprint win of the season, and extended her World Cup lead over Darya Domracheva.|$|E
5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the Scie River, necessitating {{an assault}} over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed {{with the objective of}} moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Cole {{leaves a}} last message telling the {{scientists}} that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> track, {{and that he}} will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

60|$|The captain, {{confident}} in the security of these unwritten regulations, conversed freely with his peers. He had been moved to speech by the utter absence of discipline ashore, and from that had wandered to the growing evil of revolutionary ideas at sea. His remarks were much applauded, and two brother-captains listened with grave respect to a disquisition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> of shipmasters ensuing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fancied rights of sailor men, the only discordant note being struck by the harbour-master, a man whose ideas had probably been insidiously sapped by a long residence ashore.|$|R
60|$|With a heart {{lightened}} by reconciliation (not {{the first}} reconciliation unhappily), with hopes revived, and sweet content restored, Sydney's serenity of mind {{was not quite}} unruffled. Her thoughts were not dwelling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evil life which she had honestly deplored, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wronged</b> wife to whom she had been eager to make atonement. Where is the woman whose sorrows are not thrown into the shade by the bright renewal of love? The one anxiety that troubled Sydney was caused by remembrance of the letter which she had sent to the convent at Sandyseal.|$|R
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the Dhole but he locks the room before it can cause any harm. The dog catchers arrive and open fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
50|$|In October 1835 Young drew up {{a report}} <b>on</b> grievances of <b>the</b> baronets: claims to the title of honourable, to supporters, and to dark-green apparel, with thumb-ring, SS collar, and a white hat and plume. This report was printed for private circulation; from its pages Benjamin Disraeli derived the {{colouring}} for his portrait of Sir Vavasour, who dilates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> of his order in Sybil (1845). Young was a contributor to Notes and Queries,’ and assisted Richard Griffin, 3rd Baron Braybrooke in his edition of Pepys's Diary.|$|R

Grimes, {{his family and friends}} fight to survive in a violent apocalyptic world populated with zombies and the few surviving humans, some of whom are even more diabolical and dangerous than the zombies themselves. The series is the highest rated in cable television history and has smashed all previous ratings records.

5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station {{but it was not}} until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the plywood landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed on to their objective, North Hill.|$|E
