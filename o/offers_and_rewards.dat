40|$|This {{thesis is}} about mapping the {{landscape}} of engagement with mathematics, including elucidating aspects of who we are, as human beings, when we do mathematics and of what mathematics calls us to do {{if we are to}} engage with it. Using the concept of desire in the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan and the forms of desire as elucidated by the Lacanian theorist, Mark Bracher, I seek {{to find out what the}} mathematical encounter takes (the demands and costs) and what it gives (the <b>offers</b> <b>and</b> <b>rewards).</b> My central theme is that the mathematical experience is impelled and sustained by desire which takes various forms in the involvement with mathematics. I explore the construct of desire as it relates to the notions of the subject, subjectivity, and the Other of mathematics and mathematicians. Drawing on two sources, written accounts (autobiographical and biographical) of mathematical journeys and oral accounts from interviews I conducted with practising mathematicians, I discern the mathematical subject, the one who we are when we confront the discipline of mathematics, and I show how our involvement with mathematics turns on desire. I further show the importance of this kind of inquiry in building awareness of the forces that shape the cultural endeavour that is the teaching and learning of mathematics...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} number and types of incentives being offered to teachers in rural schools and to ascertain if the offering of incentives had an effect on the recruitment and retention of teachers. Sixty-sevensuperintendents of rural schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia responded to a questionnaire. The results of the study indicate that the majority of rural school districts use fringe benefits as the primary incentive for recruiting new teachers. Also, these districts offer tuition for courses, money for instructional materials and attending conferences, and released time for special activities as the major incentives for retaining teachers. However, most school districts offer no rewards to superior teachers. Further-more, the study indicated that when school districts <b>offer</b> more incentives <b>and</b> <b>rewards,</b> fewer teachers are hired. Based on the results of the research, it is recommended that school districts <b>offer</b> more incentives <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> in order to recruit and retain competent and experienced teachers for rural schools...|$|R
