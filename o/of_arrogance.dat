Anji, Raja and Ramabhadraiah reveal the truth to Lakshmi later. Raja storms out of Gundamma's house and Saroja follows him; they join Ramabhadraiah's house as gardeners and Raja ensures Saroja is unaware of their employer. In the process, Saroja's character transforms from one <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> to one of a hardworking, courteous person.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, his autocratic {{style and}} uncompromising outlook {{destroyed}} any real influence among the expatriate community.

25|$|In recent years, {{historians have}} {{emphasised}} his failures, comparing him unfavourably to his great rival Michael Collins.

Critics accuse him <b>of</b> <b>arrogance,</b> of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of Quebec's culture and the economy of the Prairies. He retired from politics in 1984, and John Turner succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|With La Création métaphorique, the {{researcher}} inventoried the representations {{of animals in}} the late medieval imaginary: lions and cocks as representations of courage, hunting dogs as icons <b>of</b> <b>arrogance,</b> pigs as symbols of gluttony etc. The books notably showed the traditional semantic parallelisms between cats, monkeys and apes, as codified in several Romance languages, and investigated the animals' respective roles within popular demonology and metaphors of drunkenness. With Les Sources indigènes de l'étymologie française, Șăineanu offered clues on the obscure origin of various French words. Șăineanu thus sourced the French and English harlequin beyond the Italian-language arlechino in Commedia dell'arte, and back to a medieval legend in Middle French.|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} Orthodox Judaism, {{there is}} a debate on the appropriateness of women wearing tzitzit which has hinged on whether women are allowed to perform commandments from which they are exempt. According to Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik the issue depends on the intention with which such an act is undertaken, e.g. whether {{it is intended to}} fulfill the actual commandment, to bring a person closer to the Almighty, or for political or protest purposes. Other commentators hold that women are prohibited generally, without making an individual inquiry. The view that women donning a tallit would be guilty <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> is cited as applying to attempts of making a political statement as to the ritual status of the genders, particularly in the Modern Orthodox community, are generally more inclined to regard contemporary women's intentions as religiously appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Persons with narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) {{are characterized by}} their persistent grandiosity, excessive need for admiration, and a personal disdain for, and lack of empathy for other people. As such, the person with NPD usually displays the behaviors <b>of</b> <b>arrogance,</b> a sense of superiority, and actively seeks to establish abusive power and control over other people. Narcissistic {{personality disorder}} is a condition different from self-confidence (a strong sense of self); people with NPD typically value themselves over other persons {{to the extent that}} they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (Self-concept), an inability to tolerate criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.|$|E
25|$|Benítez {{has also}} had {{confrontations}} with Sam Allardyce when he was manager of Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers. When Allardyce was manager of Newcastle, he suggested Benítez would have been dismissed had Liverpool's European form been as bad as their league form. In a match in April 2009 when Allardyce was manager of Blackburn, he accused Benítez <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> over a gesture he made when Fernando Torres scored Liverpool's second goal. Allardyce suggested that Benítez had signalled {{the game was over}} despite Liverpool only having a two-goal lead. This view was later supported by Sir Alex Ferguson. Benítez, however, later explained this gesture: he said he had previously told Xabi Alonso to take a short free-kick. This instruction was ignored, which resulted in a goal. Benítez said that he had jokingly signalled to Alonso to ignore his instructions and not that he thought the game was effectively over.|$|E
25|$|Noelle is a brown-haired {{young woman}} who {{initially}} serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing tends to make her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other {{students as well as}} the Easton staff. She is shown to be overly self-confident to the point <b>of</b> <b>arrogance,</b> but very intelligent. According to some of her peers, she cannot live without drama in her life. Noelle possesses a long, red scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone from a childhood horseback riding accident. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty. As the series progresses, Noelle becomes Reed's best friend and ally. Later in the series, facts about Noelle's family are revealed and it is discovered that Noelle is Reed's paternal half-sister.|$|E

25|$|Most City {{fans are}} agreed that Manchester United is their main rivalry, a bitter rivalry which has reignited in {{last few years}} due to the {{resurgence}} of Manchester City {{as one of the}} top teams in England following their brief absence from the top flight at the end of the 20th century and City's re-emergence as a major club following their 2008 takeover. Both Manchester teams are regarded as among the best teams in the world with both clubs consistently progressing to the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League in recent years and both are in the top 5 of football clubs by revenue with the city now viewed as a football city in similar vein to cities such as Madrid and Milan, although City's disappearance from the upper echelons of the league following their 1960s-70s heyday until their recent rise has led to the two teams being regarded as polar opposites, with City seen as the nouveau riche to United's old money. The two sets of fans are traditionally diametrically opposed to each other, with City's fans accusing United <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> and of attempting to turn the Premier League into a closed shop for elite clubs only via manipulation of the rules and of the media while they in turn are accused of using their club's money as a route to success. Additionally, and in a unique twist on a cross-city rivalry, both clubs' fans accuse each other of not representing their city, with the blue half of the city observing that their adversaries do not actually play in the city of Manchester (in Trafford) and therefore do not warrant their name, while the red half instead argue over which team has more fans inside of the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{causes of}} the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens.

Thucydides hints at the same thing, believing {{the reason for the}} war was Sparta's fear of Athenian power and growth. However, as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has been criticized for bias against Sparta.|$|E
