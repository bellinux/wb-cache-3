In Padilla v.

500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and for what purpose is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the <b>objective</b> <b>standard</b> of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Brannan {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} The <b>Objective</b> <b>Standard,</b> and noted that it provides a [...] "barrage of evidence in moral defense of the oil sands producers", while Peter Foster, a Financial Post columnist, suggested that Levant [...] "not only exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the media-coddled opponents of the vast resource, but raises the uncomfortable question of what alternatives to the oilsands these moralists prefer". On the other hand, David Suzuki, dismissing Levant as an [...] "apologist", argued that [...] "the logic is faulty. Just because a country or society is considered 'ethical' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical". In the Winnipeg Free Press, John Collins, a retired union negotiator, criticized some of Levant's sources, noting {{the presence of the}} Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes, while Patrick Brethour, an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada, contends that the title of Levant’s book [...] "is a considerable misstatement" [...] and that Levant [...] "fails {{to make the case for}} ethical oil".|$|E
500|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) was a {{landmark}} Court of Appeal case in administrative law, specifically {{with regards to}} reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the Internal Security Act. One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for judicial review was objective or subjective; in other words, whether judges could examine whether the executive's decision to detain a person was in fact based on national security considerations, as well as whether the executive's considerations in determining the detention fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified in section 8(1) of the Act. The court, in an obiter ruling, advocated the <b>objective</b> <b>standard,</b> stating: [...] "All power has legal limits {{and the rule of law}} demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power." [...] Although the case was legislatively overruled in respect of internal security matters by amendments to the Constitution of Singapore and the Internal Security Act, the principle still applies in judicial review proceedings not involving the Act.|$|E

30|$|In other-referent {{subjective}} success {{an individual}} compares his/her career relative to a social standard, for instance a reference group, a reference person, or a social norm. According to social comparison theory (Festinger 1954), many {{situations in which}} evaluative judgments {{have to be made}} do not provide <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> of evaluation. There are, for instance, barely <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> for evaluating the quality of a movie, and in forming their judgment people will not only consider their own impression but others' judgments as well. In such situations people rely on social comparisons and take others as a standard of comparison. Social comparisons are frequent in situations with no or only ambiguous <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> of evaluation. Regarding the evaluation of one's career success there are many standards of comparison conceivable. Individuals will possibly consider what relevant others have achieved and this comparison will influence judgments of their own achievements. Heslin (2003) found that more than two-thirds of his respondents used social comparisons in determining their subjective success.|$|R

The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability.

2500|$|While {{agreement}} {{is the basis}} for all contracts, not all agreements are enforceable. A preliminary question is whether the contract is reasonably certain in its essential terms, or essentialia negotii, such as price, subject matter and the identity of the parties. Generally the courts endeavour to [...] "make the agreement work", so in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd, the House of Lords held that an option to buy softwood of [...] "fair specification" [...] was sufficiently certain to be enforced, when read in the context of previous agreements between the parties. However the courts do not wish to [...] "make contracts for people", and so in Scammell and Nephew Ltd v Ouston, a clause stipulating the price of buying a new van as [...] "on hire purchase terms" [...] for two years was held unenforceable because there was no <b>objective</b> <b>standard</b> by which the court could know what price was intended or what a reasonable price might be. Similarly, in Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v M plc the Court of Appeal held that because the price and quantity to buy would be uncertain, in part, no term could be implied for M to give reasonable notice before terminating its purchasing agreement. Controversially, the House of Lords extended this idea by holding an agreement to negotiate towards a future contract in good faith is insufficiently certain to be enforceable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's ruling and remanded {{the case to}} the Sixth Circuit for further proceedings. Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that the Tennessee state court correctly identified Strickland v. Washingtons two-part test as the proper legal standard for effective assistance of counsel when it rejected Cone's petition for postconviction relief. Under this standard, Cone would need to demonstrate that his attorney's [...] "representation fell below an <b>objective</b> <b>standard</b> of reasonableness" [...] and that [...] "there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different". Additionally, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that in order to presume prejudice under the standards set forth in United States v. Cronic, an attorney's failure to subject a case to adversarial scrutiny [...] "must be complete." [...] Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that Cone would also need to demonstrate that that the Tennessee court [...] "applied Strickland to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner", but he was unable to do so in this case. Citing various [...] "tactical reasons" [...] why Cone's attorney did not present mitigating evidence, Chief Justice Rehnquist concluded that the jury still had an opportunity to consider whether [...] "evidence of a mental disease or defect" [...] should mitigate Cone's ultimate sentence. Finally, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that the attorney's choice to waive his closing argument was a [...] "tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{almost any}} <b>objective</b> <b>standard,</b> the {{expedition}} {{had been a}} disaster. Franklin had travelled [...] and lost eleven of his nineteen men, only to map {{a small portion of}} coastline. He got nowhere near his goal of Repulse Bay or to meeting up with William Edward Parry's ships. When the party arrived back at York Factory in July 1822, George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company, who had objected to John Franklin's expedition from the start, wrote that [...] "They do not feel themselves at liberty to enter into the particulars of their disastrous enterprise, and I fear they have not fully achieved the object of their mission." [...] Simpson and other fur traders who knew the terrain were scathing in their descriptions of the expedition's poor planning and assessment of Franklin's competence. His reluctance to deviate from his original plan, even when it became obvious that supplies and game would be too scarce to complete the journey safely, were cited as evidence of his inflexibility and inability to adapt to a changing situation. Had Franklin been more experienced, he might have reconsidered his goals, or abandoned the expedition altogether. In a particularly harshly worded letter, Simpson also wrote of Franklin's physical failings; [...] " [...] has not the physical powers required for the labor of moderate Voyaging in this country; he must have three meals per diem, Tea is indispensable, and with the utmost exertion he cannot walk above Eight miles in one day, so that it does not follow if those Gentlemen are unsuccessful that the difficulties are insurmountable." [...] However, it should be kept in mind that many of the fur traders resented having had to assist Franklin in the first place, and Simpson in particular was angry with what he saw as Franklin's support for the rival North West Company in their trade war.|$|E
40|$|The South African and Australian law {{regarding}} directors 2 ̆ 7 duty of care, ski ll and diligence {{were influenced}} considerably by English precedent {{of the late}} 1800 s and early 19005. Originally both jurisdictions adopted a conservative approach towards directors 2 ̆ 7 duty of care, skill and diligence. This resulted in very low standards of care, skill and diligence expected of directors. In Australia, the standards of care and diligence expected of directors changed drastically with the case of Daniels v Anderson, where <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> {{were used to determine}} a breach of directors 2 ̆ 7 duty of care and diligence, and when <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> of care and diligence were introduced in Australian corporations legislation. In this article it is submitted that if the opportunity arose for a South African court to consider whether a director is in breach of his or her common law duty of care, skill and diligence, the form of fault that will be required will be negligence as judged against the standards of a reasonable person. This means that in actual fact <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> of care and diligence are expected of directors in South Africa. Although section 76 (3) of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008 does not introduce purely <b>objective</b> <b>standards</b> of care, skill and diligence, the section is defended in this article. It is pointed out that encouraging emerging entrepreneurs to become directors of South African companies provides justification for keeping subjective elements as part of the test to determine whether a director was in breach of his or her statutory duty of care, skill and diligence. <br /...|$|R
