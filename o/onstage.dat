5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume <b>onstage</b> from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for <b>onstage</b> miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|The show {{features}} all of {{the songs}} from the album American Idiot, some b-sides {{and a few of}} the songs from Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown. The show also features an <b>onstage</b> band.|$|E
5|$|Alexis Korner's {{involvement}} with Blues Incorporated {{had been a}} key ingredient in the Stones forming in 1962, and he had played <b>onstage</b> with several group members during this time. New Church had been formed with guitarist Peter Thorup after the demise of Blues Incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Charles Judels as Stromboli, a large, sinister, bearded Italian puppet-maker, who forces Pinocchio {{to perform}} <b>onstage</b> {{in order to}} make money. He speaks with an Italian accent, and curses in Italian when he gets angry, though he is {{identified}} as a gypsy. He is the only antagonist of the film {{to be part of the}} official Disney Villains line-up.|$|E
5|$|From the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, {{including}} the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for reproducing piano and electric piano sounds. Wright retained the Hammond {{along with a}} Leslie speaker, playing it <b>onstage</b> and using it during the Division Bell sessions.|$|E
5|$|Green room. A room at {{a theater}} where actors rest when not <b>onstage,</b> or a {{room at a}} {{television}} studio where guests wait before going on-camera. It originated in the late 17th century from a room of that color at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, MacFarlane {{revealed}} {{support for}} Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and he introduced Sanders <b>onstage</b> at a Los Angeles rally. After the primaries, MacFarlane then supported Hillary Clinton for president during the general election.|$|E
5|$|<b>Onstage</b> Mambo {{is known}} as an {{energetic}} performer who often includes her audience in her act. She generally collaborates with other artists, working with local bands when she performs and has other people write her songs. The mother of fourth children, as of 2013, she's married to music-video director Steve Wantania.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the <b>onstage</b> action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the <b>onstage</b> transformation.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare <b>onstage,</b> {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Director Mike Nichols, who {{had seen}} Cher <b>onstage</b> in Jimmy Dean, offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film Silkwood. When it premiered in 1983, audiences {{questioned}} Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1991, {{independent}} {{record label}} Shock Records signed TISM and re-issued Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance, {{as well as}} the EP Gentlemen, Start Your Egos (1991), a compilation of tracks previously unavailable on CD. TISM, with producer Tony Cohen, then released the EP Beasts of Suburban (1992). A new guitarist, 'Tony Coitus' (later 'Tokin' Blackman') joined the group <b>onstage</b> {{for the first time on}} 23 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|Labelled as a green tour, Thirty Seconds to Mars {{developed}} {{strategies that}} minimized fuel consumption of all touring vehicles. Head Automatica and Cobra Starship {{served as the}} opening acts, with other bands joining for select dates. The Welcome to the Universe Tour received positive reviews from critics, who praised Thirty Seconds to Mars' energy <b>onstage</b> {{and the production of}} the show. The concert tour was recorded and broadcast on MTV2.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden {{features}} concert footage {{as well as}} pre-concert and backstage content. The special received critical acclaim; critics praised Gaga's {{performance and}} the <b>onstage</b> theatrics while expressing doubt in Gaga's sincerity during her monologues and in pre-concert scenes. When aired, the special was watched by 1.2million viewers and was nominated for five awards at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, winning one for Outstanding Picture Editing for a Special (Single or Multi-Camera).|$|E
5|$|Longstreet plays a {{prominent}} role in Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 novel The Killer Angels. He is portrayed in the 1993 film Gettysburg (based on The Killer Angels) by Tom Berenger, and in the prequel, Gods and Generals (2003), by Bruce Boxleitner. He was portrayed by Brian Amidei <b>onstage</b> in the world premiere of The Killer Angels at the Lifeline Theatre in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their <b>onstage</b> cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{enjoyed a}} warm {{relationship}} with fellow Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, considered {{a member of}} the court's liberal wing, with the two attending the opera together and even appearing together <b>onstage</b> as supernumeraries in Washington National Opera's 1994 production of Ariadne auf Naxos. Ginsburg was a colleague of Scalia's on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and the Ginsburgs had dinner together every New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|Sisters Alexis, Patricia, and Rosanna Arquette {{announced}} the nominees, and Alexis Arquette (who is herself a transgender woman) presented the award. Gabbie, Lucas, Raci, and T.J.—along with filmmakers Jeremy Simmons and Thairin Smothers—took {{the stage to}} receive the award. T.J. also {{took the opportunity to}} deliver a marriage proposal to his girlfriend, Staci Gunner. When Gunner came <b>onstage</b> to accept, the audience responded with a standing ovation.|$|E
5|$|Tatiana Thumbtzen, who {{appeared}} in the short film for The Way You Make Me Feel, joined Jackson in some concerts of his Bad World Tour, and performed the song with him, strutting across the stage whilst he pursued her. However, she was fired from the tour by Jackson's manager after an incident {{during one of the}} performances in which she approached Jackson and kissed him <b>onstage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{also received}} positive reviews. When it {{opened at the}} Madison Square Theatre, a New York Times reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's allegorical material <b>onstage.</b> According to a New-York Daily Tribune reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as Jekyll and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition of a love interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.|$|E
5|$|The song {{has also}} been covered in a {{recording}} by Richard Cheese, and live in concerts by Todd Rundgren, Odd Future, Nick Jonas, and Justin Bieber. Singer Katy Perry performed the song on selected dates during her California Dreams Tour, including at the Rod Laver Arena, Newcastle Entertainment Centre, TD Garden, Air Canada Centre and the 1stBank Center. During the August 5 concert at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, Rebecca Black joined Perry <b>onstage,</b> performing the song as a duet.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} sounds he sought, Adams {{augmented}} the orchestra {{with a large}} saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the <b>onstage</b> action.|$|E
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming <b>onstage</b> with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in the dressing room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|An American Idiot stage musical {{adaptation}} premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009. The musical was {{a collaboration}} between Green Day and director Michael Mayer. Green Day did {{not appear in the}} production, but the show featured an <b>onstage</b> band. The production transferred to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, and opened in April 2010. The show received mixed to positive reviews from critics, but received a rave review from The New York Times. The show features all of the songs from the album American Idiot, including B-sides, as well as songs from Green Day's follow-up album, 21st Century Breakdown. Armstrong appeared in the Broadway production as St. Jimmy multiple times. With his return in 2011, the show grossed over $1million.|$|E
5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him <b>onstage.</b> These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs to fit a live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} the {{entertaining}} {{methods used to}} drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance <b>onstage,</b> causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus has {{performed}} the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. Cyrus {{wore a black}} sequined cat suit during the performance. During this segment of the tour, a kiss cam was featured on the Jumbotron of the hosting arena. The performance also featured a red and white gingham horse during select shows. During a performance on February 22, Cyrus kissed recording artist Katy Perry {{in the middle of}} the track, which resulted in a minor conflict between the women. During a later showing on February 27, Cyrus invited Matt Peterson, who notably asked Cyrus to his high school prom through YouTube that January, <b>onstage</b> while she sang.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go <b>onstage.</b> Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against <b>onstage</b> screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, with {{finances}} {{given to}} her by United Artists executive Richard Stewart, Tina returned <b>onstage,</b> giving a round of shows in Las Vegas in a cabaret setting, influenced by the cabaret shows she witnessed while {{a member of the}} Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She took her cabaret act to smaller venues in the United States. Turner earned further income by appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares, Donny and Marie, The Sonny & Cher Show and The Brady Bunch Hour. Later in 1977, Turner headlined her first solo concert tour, throughout Australia. In 1978, United Artists released Turner's third solo album, Rough, with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI. That album, along with its follow-up, Love Explosion, which included a brief diversion to disco rhythms, failed to chart.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed <b>onstage</b> and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
5|$|In {{reproducing}} the album's {{recorded music}} <b>onstage,</b> he performed with his eight-piece band, which included bass player Calvin Turner, drummers Lemar Carter and Charles Jones, guitarists Rob Bacon and Josh Smith, and backing singers Erika Jerry and BJ Kemp. In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way I See It, Saadiq {{did not include a}} horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E
5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life <b>onstage,</b> reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies in its {{first few months of}} release in the UK, despite no significant radio airplay. The record charted for 35 weeks on the British albums chart, peaking at number three. After it {{was released}} in the US on April 18, Tricky toured the country as a supporting act for fellow English recording artist PJ Harvey. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 222,000 copies in the US by 2003. By 2012, it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. That same year, Tricky performed the entire album with Topley-Bird on April 27 at the Sundance London festival, which was their first <b>onstage</b> appearance together in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1969, Pacino {{made his}} Broadway debut in Don Petersen's Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? at the Belasco Theater {{produced}} by A Heir Huntington Hartford. It closed after 39 performances on March 29, 1969, but Pacino received rave reviews {{and won the}} Tony Award on April 20, 1969. Pacino continued performing <b>onstage</b> in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's American Buffalo, for which Pacino {{was nominated for a}} Drama Desk Award. Since 1990, Pacino's stage work has included revivals of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie, Oscar Wilde's Salome and in 2005 Lyle Kessler's Orphans.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2016, Perry {{collapsed}} <b>onstage</b> at {{a concert}} he was performing with the Hollywood Vampires on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest. He was revived and rushed to the hospital, where he was quickly upgraded to stable condition later that night. The Vampires continued the show without Perry that evening and continued {{the rest of their}} tour, but canceled an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. After resting for a few days, Perry made a complete recovery and returned to the Hollywood Vampires tour.|$|E
