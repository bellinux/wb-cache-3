His first {{recording}} as a leader, the solo piano Blues for Smoke, was recorded there on December 16, 1960 (but not released in the United States until 1988). Also in 1960, Byard first played with the bassist Charles Mingus. He recorded extensively with Mingus in the period 1962–64 (including on the important albums <b>on</b> <b>Impulse!</b> Records – Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus and The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady), and toured Europe with him in 1964. Byard also made recordings as a sideman between 1960 and 1966 with Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin, Roland Kirk, and Rivers. His performance on Dolphy's Outward Bound put Byard {{at the forefront of}} modern jazz.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three patches {{distributed}} since the game's initial release. The first patch for the game was released on October 21, 2010, while the second came out on October 28, and the third appeared on December 31, bringing the game to version 1.0.5. These updates improved such elements as gameplay, graphics, and the campaign map. The developers also intended to expand ProtoGalaxy with new features and levels. A party celebrating the game's launch was held on October 15, 2010 at Memorial University. On February 25, 2011, Source Studio released Proto Defense, which enhanced the level editor and provided gamers with a new tower-defense-style level as downloadable content. On April 28, 2011, ProtoGalaxy was released <b>on</b> <b>Impulse,</b> another digital distribution platform.|$|E

He recounts how he invented chemicals capable of rendering bodies invisible, and, <b>on</b> <b>impulse,</b> performed the procedure on himself.|$|E
25|$|First, the {{movement}} system (and turn structure with it) departs {{from the traditional}} 'everyone takes a turn in order' structure used {{in the vast majority}} of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a little bit of the total movement (termed an impulse, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, and targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn's final impulse.|$|E

He acted impatiently and <b>on</b> <b>impulse.</b> Previously flexible he now relied on dogma, denouncing Nasser as a second Hitler. Though he claimed to be upholding international law, he in fact disregarded the United Nations Organisation which he had helped to create … The outcome was pathetic rather than tragic”.|$|E

There was a pause to coordinate action between the two columns. The following day, three ADC companies of irregulars led by CIA case officer Tony Poe were heli-lifted into Sala Phou Khoun by Air America. <b>On</b> <b>impulse,</b> Poe ignored CIA restrictions on engaging in combat, and led his troops in the unauthorized assault. At 2100 hours, the three companies of guerrillas occupied the empty intersection. GM 11 and GM 16 did not move in until the following day.|$|E
25|$|The {{poems of}} Isabella were {{discovered}} when the authorities entered her estate {{to investigate the}} murder. There are ten sonnets and three poems, which were published posthumously. She {{has been associated with}} the 1500s literary movement known as Petrarchism, a revival of Petrarch's model launched by Pietro Bembo. Although her form, vocabulary and phrases follow the Petrarchist fashion of the period, she is distinguished by her dramatic tone, demonstrated by medieval poets such as Dante Alighieri and Jacopone da Todi. Her poetry is very personal, influenced by her own family condition and forced isolation; she wrote <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> in order to vent her frustration, without any literary adornment or formal elegance.|$|E
5000|$|People {{that face}} this issue are {{currently}} defined {{to have a}} [...] "brain disease" [...] as promoted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other authorities. People who experience addictive personality disorders typically act <b>on</b> <b>impulses</b> and cannot deal with delayed gratification. At the same time, people {{with this type of}} personality tend to believe that they do not fit into societal norms and therefore, acting <b>on</b> <b>impulses,</b> deviate from conformity to rebel. People with addictive personalities are very sensitive to emotional stress. They have trouble handling situations that they deem frustrating, even if the event is for a very short duration. The combination of low self-esteem, impulsivity and low tolerance for stress causes these individuals to have frequent mood swings and often suffer from some sort of depression. A coping mechanism to deal with their conflicting personality becomes their addiction and the addiction acts as something that the person can control when they find it difficult to control their personality traits.|$|R

50|$|Expectancies and {{anticipation}} {{which are}} important to keep behaviour consistent in normal states seem to be decreased in strength which might lead to surprising or out-of-character behaviour. Normally these expectancies let the person behave in a goal directed and reasonable manner, with the decrease the person might act out in illogical and unforeseeable ways. Similarly inhibitions, especially social inhibition seems to be reduced, resulting in playful behaviour and acting <b>on</b> <b>impulses.</b>|$|R
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E
500|$|By early 1989, {{the title}} of Mr. Wiggles had been retired as the band {{switched}} to the intentionally risqué [...] " [...] Daddies". Derived from a jive phrase the band had heard on a vintage race record, the name intended to reflect the group's jazz and blues influences {{as well as an}} edgy punk irreverence in the same vein as the Butthole Surfers, though the decision was ultimately made <b>on</b> <b>impulse,</b> as the members had run out of time to figure out a name to put on their posters and doubted their longevity past a handful of shows. The band played their first show as the Cherry Poppin' Daddies at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall on March 31, 1989.|$|E
500|$|Tigon Productions {{owned the}} rights to Ronald Bassett's 1966 novel, Witchfinder General, which was loosely based on the {{historical}} Matthew Hopkins, a self-described [...] "witchhunter" [...] {{who claimed to have}} been commissioned by Parliament to prosecute and execute witches. Hopkins was in fact never given an official mandate to hunt witches. Tony Tenser, the founder and chief executive of Tigon, had read Bassett's book while it was still in galley form and purchased the rights <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> before publication. Despite the novel being [...] "tedious low-brow popular history", Tenser felt it [...] "had some scope, had some breadth to it; there was canvas for a film." [...] Tenser offered the film to Michael Reeves, who had just completed Tigon's The Sorcerers (1967), starring Boris Karloff.|$|E

500|$|Bonfiglioli {{disliked the}} title of the magazine, feeling that it [...] "promised the worst of both worlds"; he {{proposed}} Caliban as the new title, but the publisher dissuaded him. He settled <b>on</b> <b>Impulse</b> instead, and the magazine appeared under the new title starting with the March 1966 issue. The paperback format was unchanged, but the volume numeration was restarted at volume 1 number 1, to [...] "sever all connections with Science Fantasy", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. The name change proved to be disastrous; there was already a magazine called Impulse, and this caused distribution problems. In addition, treating Impulse as a new magazine meant a fresh distribution contract was needed. Bonfiglioli attempted to repair the damage by changing the name to SF Impulse starting in August 1966, but the result was a dramatic drop in circulation.|$|E
500|$|A core {{tenet of}} {{psychodrama}} is Moreno's theory of [...] "spontaneity-creativity". Moreno {{believed that the}} best way for an individual to respond creatively to a situation is through spontaneity, that is, through a readiness to improvise and respond in the moment. By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way, reacting spontaneously and based <b>on</b> <b>impulse,</b> they may begin to discover new solutions to problems in their lives and learn new roles they can inhabit within it. Moreno's focus on spontaneous action within the psychodrama was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity, which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s. [...] Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional, scripted theatre, he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work. He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s. [...] This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory.|$|E
500|$|The British Rocket Group, {{headed by}} the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass, {{launches}} its first manned rocket into space. Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three crew: Carroon, Reichenheim, and Green. The large rocket later returns to earth, crashing into an English country field. [...] Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene, along with the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, [...] Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe, and Blake, a Ministry official who chides him repeatedly for launching the rocket <b>on</b> <b>impulse</b> and without official permission. [...] Finally opening the rocket's access hatch, the space-suited Carroon stumbles outside; inside, {{there is no sign}} of the other two crew members. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words [...] "Help me". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh can find no sign of the other two crewmen, only their completely-fastened spacesuits.|$|E
