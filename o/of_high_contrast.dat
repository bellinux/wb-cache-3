5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of fire engines focuses greatly {{on the use of}} both active and passive warnings. Passive visual warnings involve the use <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> patterns to increase the noticeability of the vehicle. These types of warnings are often seen on older vehicles and those in developing countries. More modern designs make use of retroreflectors to reflect light from other vehicles. Vehicles will also often have these reflectors arranged in a chevron pattern along with the words fire or rescue. European countries commonly use a pattern known as battenburg markings. Along with the passive warnings, are active visual warnings which are usually in the form of flashing colored lights (also known as [...] "beacons" [...] or [...] "lightbars"). These flash {{to attract the attention of}} other drivers as the fire truck approaches, or to provide warning to drivers approaching a parked fire truck in a dangerous position on the road. While the fire truck is headed towards the scene, the lights are always accompanied by loud audible warnings such as sirens and air horns.|$|E

5000|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating {{took off}} with a report on a {{broadband}} high reflectivity reflector for surface-normal incident light (the ratio between the wavelength bandwidth with a reflectivity larger than 0.99 and the central wavelength is greater than 30%) in 2004 by Constance J. Chang-Hasnain et al., which was demonstrated experimentally in the same year. The key idea {{is to have the}} high-refractive-index material all surrounded by low-refractive-index material. They are subsequently applied as a highly reflective mirror in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, as well as monolithic, continuously wavelength tunable vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. The properties <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating are rapidly explored since then. The following lists some relevant examples: ...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{proposed}} {{to restrict the}} contrast volume (CV) to 3. Likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate whether the effect <b>of</b> a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> dose on the risk of CIN and nephropathy requiring dialysis (NRD) varied across the spectrum of baseline predicted risk. Of the 82, 120 PCI included in our analysis, 25 % were performed using a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> dose.

The effect size <b>of</b> a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> dose on risks of both outcomes varied significantly with baseline predicted CIN risk and CCC (CIN p =  0. 004, NRD p< 0. 001 for adding interactions), and was largest for patients with predicted CIN risk < 10 % and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. The use <b>of</b> a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> dose is associated with increased risks of CIN and NRD across the continuum of baseline predicted risk and CCC.

5000|$|High {{contrast}} gratings {{have been}} employed in many optoelectronic devices. It has been incorporated as the mirrors for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. The light-weight <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating enables fast microelectromechanical structure actuation for wavelength tuning. The reflection {{phase of the}} high contrast grating is engineered to control the emission wavelength of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. By locally changing each grating dimension while keeping its thickness the same, planar, single-layer lenses and focusing reflectors with high focusing power have been obtained. Besides its high reflectivity, the high contrast grating has been designed as a high quality factor resonator. Low-loss hollow-core waveguide are made with high contrast gratings with high reflectivity at oblique incident angle. Applications such as slow light [...] and optical switch [...] can be built on the hollow-core waveguide by using the special phase response and resonance property <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> grating. High contrast grating can effectively manipulate the light propagation - directing light from surface-normal to in-plane index-guided waveguide and vice versa.|$|E

Another camera took pictures out of the bottom of the missile, imaged onto a similar display. A computer compared the two displays and attempted to line up areas <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>contrast,</b> similar to the contrast seekers used in the Maverick missile, and the offsets needed to align the two images could be decoded into a location and heading. However, this system proved to be very slow, and no such system was ever employed operationally, its role being taken up by TERCOM.|$|E
