25|$|Young's modulus is {{the ratio}} of stress (which has units <b>of</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>to</b> strain (which is dimensionless), and so Young's modulus has units of pressure.

One subtype of tactile hallucination, formication, is the sensation of insects crawling underneath the skin and is frequently associated with prolonged cocaine use.

Since none of these were on trial for murder, the state agreed, and those inmates (and later Lorenz himself) were released.|$|E

25|$|The {{avionics}} suite {{was almost}} entirely of Israeli design, and employed a modular design capable of adding upgrades via the Elbit ACE-4 mission computer. The Lavi had a bootstrap-type hydraulic system, pressurised by Adex pumps providing 207 bars <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the flight surfaces. The electronics were powered by a Sundstrand 60 kVA integrated drive generator, with a SAFT main battery and Marathon standby; Sundstrand also provided the actuation system. The emergency power unit (EPU) and environmental control system were produced by Garrett AiResearch, as was the secondary power system.|$|E
25|$|Contour cuffs have an arc-shaped design that, when {{wrapped around}} a limb, gives them a smaller {{diameter}} distally than proximally. Contour cuffs enhance comfort in patients with tapered limbs and {{reduce the risk of}} mechanical shearing. It has been reported that contour tourniquet cuffs occlude blood flow at lower inflation pressures than standard rectangular cuffs of equal width, which may be attributable to better cuff fit and more efficient transmission <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> deep tissues. There are two types of contour cuff designs; fixed-contour and variable-contour.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of launch on 17 December 1912, Endurance was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the {{possible}} exception of Fram, the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. However, there was one major difference between the ships. Fram was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. But since Endurance was designed to operate in relatively loose pack ice she was not constructed so as to rise out <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> any great extent.|$|E
25|$|Muscle strain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in tennis. When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> the lengthened muscle which can result in the occurrence of muscle strain. Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occur which resulted in redness, pain and swelling. Overuse is also common in tennis players from all level. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recover in the most common case among the injury.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the hearing, Inslaw owners William and Nancy Hamilton {{spoke to}} Anthony Pasciuto, then the Deputy Director of the Executive Office of the United States Trustees (EOUST), a DOJ {{component}} responsible for overseeing {{the administration of}} bankruptcy cases. Pasciuto told the Hamiltons that the Director of the EOUST, Thomas Stanton, had pressured the U.S. Trustee assigned to the Inslaw case, Edward White, to convert Inslaw's bankruptcy from chapter 11 (reorganization of the company), to chapter 7 (liquidation). The Hamiltons had Inslaw's attorneys depose the people whom Pasciuto had named. One of them corroborated part of Pasciuto's claims: Cornelius Blackshear, then a U. S. Trustee in New York, swore in his deposition testimony that he was aware <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> convert the bankruptcy. Two days later, however, Blackshear submitted an affidavit recanting his testimony, {{saying that he had}} mistakenly recalled an instance of pressure from another case.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the source <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> women crosscountry runners are subjected to in the Mid-American Conference to manage and control their weight. Questionnaires were sent out to each Mid-American Conference school to evaluate the women cross-country runners regarding the source <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> manage and control weight. Frequency counts were used to determine the source <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>to</b> control and monitor weight. The results suggested that both the coach as well as the athlete make a conscious effort to monitor and control weight. However, the data suggests that dieting during the competitive season is not a major concern for women cross-country runners. The method used for the MAC runners to monitor weight was by body composition, body weight, then both body composition and body weight. The data suggests that education concerning healthy weight management has helped decrease weight management concerns for these athletes. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

25|$|Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have {{investigated}} whether hydrogenation {{can be achieved}} without the side effect of trans fat production. They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted— applying 1400kPa (200psi) <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140°C and 170°C. The standard 140kPa (20psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat. The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature {{and the length of}} time during hydrogenation.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Commission had firmly {{rejected}} the principles {{on which the}} National Party's official policy of apartheid was based, and therefore raised its ire. Hendrik Verwoerd, then an MP {{and the editor of}} Die Transvaler, was especially critical. And a declaration signed by a prominent group of Stellenbosch academics angrily pointed out that if Fagan's racial integration were allowed this would lead inevitably to gelykstelling (social levelling) and, as a result <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> give blacks equal civil rights, the political marginalisation of the white population; the upshot would be the death of the Afrikaner volk. Though they were angry, the Nationalists had not been caught unprepared: in fact, Malan had already set up a rival commission headed by his closest confidante, Paul Sauer, and staffed by three NP parliamentarians, and which had reported in 1947. The Sauer Commission had given added detail and heft to the Nationalists' policy of apartheid, recommending that influx control measures be strengthened to prevent any mixing between the races, with black people consigned to the reserves. It was this hard-line view which triumphed when Malan's National Party won the 1948 general election.|$|E

For at-risk long-haul travelers—those with [...] "previous VTE, recent {{surgery or}} trauma, active malignancy, pregnancy, estrogen use, advanced age, limited mobility, severe obesity, or known thrombophilic disorder"—suggestions included calf exercises, frequent walking, and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking.

500|$|In 2010, the BBC {{analyzed}} the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. [...] "Middle-aged {{men are not}} 'supposed' to cry during movies," [...] stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that [...] "men, if they have felt weepy during , have often tried to be surreptitious about it." [...] Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, [...] "For many men, {{there is a great}} deal <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed." [...] Rohrer said, [...] "Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon." [...] For men in general, [...] "the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion".|$|E
