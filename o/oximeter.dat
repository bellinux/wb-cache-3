5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse <b>oximeter.</b> These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse <b>oximeter</b> is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse <b>oximeter.</b> This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Deoxygenated {{hemoglobin}} is {{the form}} of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. The absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ. The oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940nm its absorption is slightly higher. This difference {{is used for the}} measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patient's blood by an instrument called a pulse <b>oximeter.</b> This difference also accounts for the presentation of cyanosis, the blue to purplish color that tissues develop during hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse <b>oximeter</b> you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, pulse <b>oximeters</b> {{came into}} {{widespread}} use. Pulse <b>oximeters</b> can sonify oxygen concentration of blood by emitting higher pitches for higher concentrations. However, in practice this particular feature of pulse <b>oximeters</b> {{may not be}} widely utilized by medical professionals {{because of the risk}} of too many audio stimuli in medical environments.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a new calibrator for pulse <b>oximeters</b> is tested with five pulse <b>oximeters</b> from different manufacturers. The calibrator is based on time resolved transmission spectra of human fingers. Finger spectra with different arterial oxygen saturation can be selected to simulate real patients. The results obtained with this calibration device are compared {{with the results of}} conventional calibration procedures with volunteers. Beside accuracy tests the suitability for artifact simulation with the new device is discussed. The response of the five tested pulse <b>oximeters</b> is in good agreement with the response of the pulse <b>oximeters</b> connected to real patients. A test procedure for pulse <b>oximeters</b> similar to the conventional desaturation practice is possible; some of the typical artifacts pulse oximetry has to cope with can be simulated easily. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{simplicity}} {{of use and}} the ability to provide continuous and immediate oxygen saturation values, pulse <b>oximeters</b> are of critical importance in emergency medicine and are also very useful for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially COPD, or for diagnosis of some sleep disorders such as apnea and hypopnea. Portable battery-operated pulse <b>oximeters</b> are useful for pilots operating in a non-pressurized aircraft above 10,000 feet (12,500 feet in the U.S.) where supplemental oxygen is required. Portable pulse <b>oximeters</b> are also useful for mountain climbers and athletes whose oxygen levels may decrease at high altitudes or with exercise. Some portable pulse <b>oximeters</b> employ software that charts a patient's blood oxygen and pulse, serving as a reminder to check blood oxygen levels.|$|R

Athletes are often concerned about endurance and intensity of exercise. Using the scientific technique of absorption spectroscopy with eight wavelengths of light. This method {{is similar to a}} pulse <b>oximeter,</b> which consists of a small sensing device that clips to the finger. The sensor uses light-emitting diodes that emit red and infrared light through the tissue to a light detector, which then sends a signal to a processor to calculate the absorption of light by the hemoglobin protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of photocells. Various types of photocells were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices. By the mid-1930s, selenium photocells controlled assembly lines, elevators and looms. Fire alarms with selenium sensors came into mass production in the UK {{and then in the}} US. Norbert Wiener proposed, and Truman Gray built an optical scanner for inputting and processing data in analog computers. Kurt Kramer introduced a selenium photocell to medical research. In 1940, Glenn Milliken built the first practical selenium-based <b>oximeter</b> to monitor the physical condition of the Royal Air Force pilots. It was a RO where the light source and detector were separated by the ear lobe of the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii Vitality Sensor was a {{cancelled}} peripheral; a fingertip pulse <b>oximeter</b> sensor {{that connected}} through the Wii Remote. According to Nintendo, the device [...] "will initially sense the user's pulse {{and a number}} of other signals being transmitted by their bodies, and will then provide information to the users about the body’s inner world." [...] The Wii Vitality Sensor was announced by President and CEO Satoru Iwata at Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. No specific applications were revealed for the device, but when presenting the device Iwata suggested that video games may soon be used for relaxation. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, more details concerning the Wii Vitality Sensor were to be showcased during E3 2010, although no mention of the device occurred. Reggie told GameTrailers, [...] "(E3) was not the kind of environment for a game based on relaxation", mentioning they are saving news on the device for another time and place. At E3 2010, Ubisoft introduced their own pulse <b>oximeter</b> sensor, [...] "Innergy". However, at E3 2011, Nintendo announced more about the Wii Vitality Sensor. Shigeru Miyamoto said that the Wii Vitality Sensor has a difficult time performing consistently across a variety of situations but still may be released.|$|E
