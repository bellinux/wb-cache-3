25|$|Carotenes {{are found}} in plants in two primary forms {{designated}} by characters from the Greek alphabet: alpha-carotene (α-carotene) and beta-carotene (β-carotene). Gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, and zeta-carotene (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with <b>other</b> <b>carotenoids,</b> the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{carotenoids}} include lycopene and the vitamin A precursor β-carotene. In plants, the xanthophyll lutein {{is the most}} abundant carotenoid {{and its role in}} preventing age-related eye disease is currently under investigation. Lutein and the <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> pigments found in mature leaves are often not obvious because of the masking presence of chlorophyll. When chlorophyll is not present, as in autumn foliage, the yellows and oranges of the carotenoids are predominant. For the same reason, carotenoid colors often predominate in ripe fruit after being unmasked by the disappearance of chlorophyll.|$|R
40|$|AbstractReal time {{detection}} following laser {{flash photolysis}} of transient carotenoid radical cations and tocopheroxyl radicals formed in chloroform and bleaching of the carotenoids has allowed interaction between carotenoids and tocopherols to be studied. It is found that α-, β-, and γ-tocopherol reduce all the carotenoid radical cations investigated whereas the δ-tocopheroxyl radical {{can be reduced}} by lycopene and β-carotene. Astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and β-apo- 8 ′-carotenal radical cations are scavenged rapidly by all four tocopherol homologues whereas the <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> radical cations react much more slowly with the tocopherols.

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} and selection are major forces driving microbial evolution. However, interactions between them are rarely studied. Phylogenetic analyses of purple bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis genes suggest two lineages: one producing spheroidenone {{and the other}} producing spirilloxanthin. Of the latter lineage, Rubrivivax gelatinosus S 1 and Hoeflea phototrophica DFL- 43 also or instead produce spheroidenone. Evolution of the spheroidenone pathway from that producing spirilloxanthin theoretically requires changes in the substrate specificity of upstream pathway enzymes and acquisition of a terminal ketolase (CrtA). In R. gelatinosus and likely also in H. phototrophica, CrtA was acquired from the Bacteroidetes, in which it functions as a hydroxylase. Estimation of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations using several pairwise methods indicated positive selection upon both genes, consistent with their functional changes from hydroxylases to ketolases. Relaxed negative selection upon all <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> biosynthetic genes in these organisms was also apparent, likely facilitating changes in their substrate specificities. Furthermore, all genes responsible for terminal carotenoid biosynthetic pathway steps were under reduced negative selection compared to those known to govern biosynthetic pathway specificity. Horizontal transfer of crtA into R. gelatinosus and H. phototrophica has therefore likely been promoted by (i) the apparent selective advantage of spheroidenone production relative to spirilloxanthin production, (ii) reduced negative selection upon <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> biosynthetic genes, facilitating changes in their substrate specificities, and (iii) preexisting low enzyme substrate specificities due to relaxed negative selection. These results highlight the importance and complexity of selection acting upon both a horizontally transferred gene and the biochemical network into which it is integrating...|$|R
25|$|The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the {{xanthophyll}} beta-cryptoxanthin (all {{of which}} contain beta-ionone rings), but no <b>other</b> <b>carotenoids,</b> function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it to retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionone-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting {{in none of}} the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).|$|E

The carotenes α-carotene and γ-carotene, due to their single retinyl group (β-ionone ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than β-carotene), as does the xanthophyll carotenoid β-cryptoxanthin.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{produced}} by all photosynthetic organisms {{and a large number}} of bacteria and fungi. They are responsible for a lot of pigmentation in nature, as well as often playing an essential role in the provision of light protection to cells and as precursors of vitamin A in higher organisms. Myxobacton is the primary carotenoid ester generated in the photoresistant bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. It is created through a complex light-regulated gene expression cascade and acts to protect the bacteria from blue light and the resultant generation of damaging singlet oxygen species in the presence of porphyrins. The final stage in its production is a ketonisation, and the enzyme responsible for this stage was unknown in M. xanthus. We propose a possible location for the gene encoding such a ketolase, crtW. The gene is found located within a four-gene operon separate from the <b>other</b> known <b>carotenoid</b> biosynthetic genes, and appears to have two alternative promoter regions. The additional genes in the operon were found to encode a putative MutT/Nudix family hydrolase and a periplasmic, molybdopterin and haeme-dependent oxidoreductase, YedYZ. It is also shown that crtW transcription is independent of cell exposure to blue light and that the product is an inner membrane, integral membrane protein probable ketolase. The evolutionary origins of crtW are considered in conjunction with a number of <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that the gene {{was one of the last}} to be acquired by M. xanthus.

30|$|The LC-MS {{analysis}} showed that phytoene, lycopene, β-carotene and <b>other</b> <b>carotenoid</b> compounds were reduced. This {{is caused by the}} down-regulation of the phytoene synthase gene in transformed orchids. ABA synthesis is also reduced as a downstream effect of the inhibition of the carotenoid metabolic pathway. Chlorophyll contents and GA levels were reduced in the mutants. Chlorophyll biosynthesis and GA biosynthesis are branches of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Both are synthesized from the common substrate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Theoretically, reduction of the amount of phytoene and of phytoene synthase activity may cause a large accumulation of GGPP, which should result in a massive biosynthesis of chlorophyll and GA. The reverse results indicated {{that there might be a}} feedback mechanism when the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is blocked at the step of phytoene synthase. Interestingly, the result is similar to phytoene desaturase studies in Arabidopsis, where pds insertional knock-out mutants showed dwarfism and a low chlorophyll/carotenoid content (Qin et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Erwinia herbicola is a nonphotosynthetic {{bacterium}} that is yellow pigmented due to {{the presence}} of carotenoids. When the Erwinia carotenoid biosynthetic genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, this bacterium also displays a yellow phenotype. The DNA sequence of the plasmid pPL 376, carrying the entire Erwinia carotenoid gene cluster, has been found to contain 12 open reading frames (ORFs). Six of the ORFs have been identified as carotenoid biosynthesis genes that code for all the enzymes required for conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to zeaxanthin diglucoside via geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, phytoene, lycopene, [3 carotene, and zeaxanthin. These enzymatic steps were assigned after disruption of each ORF by a specific mutation and analysis of the accumulated intermediates. Carotenoid intermediates were identified by the absorption spectra of the colored components and by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis.
