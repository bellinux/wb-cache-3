40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} two main purposes of the teaching of English literature at university level in an EFL situation. The first, literature as study, {{is divided into two}} options. One is the type of teaching that considers literature as a cultural product for whose interpretation aspects outside the literary work (historical, social, critical, biographical data) must be accounted for. The other is the stylistics <b>option,</b> <b>dealing</b> with the analysis of literary texts by examining their language. The second general purpose is the recent widespread use of literature as a resource for the teaching of the English language. In our opinion, it is the EFL environment which allows the implementation of the two aims, whose goals and methods are closely interlinked, providing as well a connection between the teaching of language and literature. Some suggestions for this implementation are offered in the specific case of Spanish universities...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Management) During {{the last}} decade, options, which are {{financial}} instruments used for trading and hedging, have shown greater development {{than any other}} financial instrument {{over the same period}} of time. Because <b>option</b> <b>dealing</b> is perceived in the market-place as an instrument which is technically advanced, innovative and, complex, many potential option players do not take part in trading. This process' of withdrawal is fuelled by constant negative publicity given to option trading, but very seldom are reports written on success stories relating to option trading. Current option-trading participants are also constantly reminded by the press; other companies, senior management, board members and shareholders that they run the risk of losing vast sums of money and could take the company down with one reckless transaction. What is unfortunate is {{that they will not be}} able to prevent or detect transactions that could lead to such losses. Trading risk is further increased by the fact that quality risk management staff are also very difficult to acquire as this function is perceived to be not as glamorous as being an option dealer. Given the above scenario of what is really happening out there in the world of option trading, the question arises whether option trading activities should be embarked upon by Institutions who have never dealt in options and whether current option trading participants should continue trading or should discontinue trading activities as soon as possible...|$|E
