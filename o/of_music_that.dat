The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics.

5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005). The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had been exposed to different types <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> she had never heard before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, Philly soul, funk, {{rock and}} most other genres were {{dominated}} by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk bands like The O'Jays and The Spinners continued to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> was again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E
5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. As {{was the case with}} other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most part}} disapproved <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1970s, highly {{slick and}} {{commercial}} bands such as Philly soul group The O'Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success. By {{the end of}} the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, had been disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> was once again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, GMG radio {{conducted}} {{market research}} into the type <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> listeners in the north-west of England wanted to hear on the radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played {{middle of the road}} music, soul and R during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a wave of}} Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) {{brought with}} them the kadans, a {{sophisticated}} form <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|Neo soul is a {{genre of}} popular music. The term was coined by music {{industry}} entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg {{during the late}} 1990s to market and describe a style <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> emerged from soul and contemporary R. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Alternative rock {{is a broad}} {{umbrella}} term consisting <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> differs {{greatly in}} terms of its sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and alternative hip hop. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.|$|E

5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network.
