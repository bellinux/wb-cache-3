500|$|For Peel, Thunderbirds is [...] "without a {{doubt the}} peak of the Supermarionation achievement". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a [...] "more adult" [...] level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, {{effective}} humour and [...] "gripping and convincing" [...] episodes ensured that [...] "everyone in the audience found something to love about it." [...] Simon Heffer, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011: [...] "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds: dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, {{at a time when the}} whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves..." [...] Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a [...] "television perennial".|$|E

500|$|There is an {{apocryphal}} {{story of}} King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders {{back into the}} pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling {{one of them to}} a position [...] back and [...] to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark [...] "angler". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he [...] "went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over." [...] He claimed to have [...] "hit the first delivery to cover point but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no one there. The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six." [...] The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{ended the}} life of Johan de Witt, who had in effect ruled the Republic for almost twenty years. His regime outlasted him only a few more days. Though no more people were killed, the lynching of De Witts lent renewed impetus to the mob attacks, and to help restore public order the States of Holland {{empowered}} William on August 27 [...] to purge the city councils in any way he would see fit to restore public order. The following purges {{in the early days}} of September were accompanied by large, but peaceful, Orangist demonstrations, that had a remarkable political character. The demonstrations delivered petitions that demanded certain additional reforms with a, in a sense, [...] "reactionary" [...] flavor: the [...] "ancient" [...] privileges of the guilds and civic militias (who were traditionally seen as mouthpieces of the citizenry as a whole) to curb the regent's powers were to be recognized again (as in pre-Burgundian times). The demonstrators also demanded more influence of the Calvinist preachers on the content of government policies and a roll-back of the toleration of Catholics and other dissenting denominations. The purges of the city governments were not everywhere equally thoroughgoing (and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little mention of popular influence later on, as the new regents shared the abhorrence of the old ones of real democratic reforms). But as a whole, the new Orangist regime of the Stadtholder was well-entrenched during his following reign.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{written with}} help from ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz, Rather wrote {{that he was in}} Dallas to return film from an {{interview}} that morning in Uvalde at the ranch of former Vice President John Nance Garner who actually celebrated his 95th (Rather erroneously called it his 98th) birthday on November 22. Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for the need to get film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, I heard one shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' And <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing but panic wherever you looked." ...|$|E
