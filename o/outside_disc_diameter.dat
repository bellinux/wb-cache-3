40|$|Background: Assessment of {{optic disc}} size is an {{important}} component of optic nerve head examination. Agreement between different methods of disc size measurements is not very good. Purpose: To assess the agreement between the disc size assessed by Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) and stereobiomicroscopy with a 90 diopter (D) lens. To report the clinical (measured by biomicroscopy) <b>disc</b> <b>diameters</b> of small, average and large optic discs categorized by HRT disc areas. Setting and Design: Observational study of subjects examined in the glaucoma clinic of a tertiary eye institute. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five eyes of 75 glaucoma subjects were studied. <b>Disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was measured using stereobiomicroscopy and HRT. The agreement between the two sets of measurements was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Discs were classified into small (&# 60; 1. 6 mm 2), average (1. 6 - 2. 6 mm 2) and large (> 2. 6 mm 2) depending on cutoffs provided by the manufacturers of HRT. The means (95 &#x 0025; CI) of the corresponding vertical <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> in these groups were assessed. Statistical Analysis: ICC, Bland and Altman plots. Results: ICC for measurements of clinical and HRT horizontal <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was 0. 518 and for vertical <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> measurement was 0. 487. The mean difference between the clinical and HRT measurements as analyzed by the Bland and Altman plot was 0. 17 (95 &#x 0025; CI, 0. 13 - 0. 47) for horizontal and 0. 22 (95 &#x 0025; CI, 0. 11 - 0. 54) for vertical <b>disc</b> <b>diameter.</b> Of the 75 eyes, 3 eyes had small discs, 54 average and 18 large discs. The mean clinical vertical <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> for small <b>discs</b> was 1. 55 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7), for average discs was 1. 91 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 1. 87 - 1. 96) and for large discs was 2. 15 mm (95 &#x 0025; CI, 2. 03 - 2. 27). Conclusion: The agreement between clinical and HRT <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> measurements is moderate. <b>Disc</b> <b>diameter</b> measurement on stereobiomicroscopy can be used to categorize discs into small, average and large discs...|$|R

This detachment was unrelated to the previously treated retinal break. In the series of group A the mean follow-up period was 27. 8 months. From previously reported follow-up data it is probable that at least in the case of flap symptomatic tears our results can be considered conclusive.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{describe}} {{the relationships of}} retinal vascular caliber to optic <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> in children. METHODS. A school-based cross-sectional study of 746 children aged 7 to 9 years {{who participated in the}} Singapore Cohort Study of the Risk Factors for Myopia. Digital retinal photographs of both eyes were taken in 2001 and graded for retinal vascular caliber, vertical optic <b>disc</b> <b>diameter,</b> and vertical cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) according to standardized protocols. All measurements in pixels were analyzed after correction of the magnification. RESULTS. In this study population, the mean retinal arteriolar caliber (SD) was 5. 95 (0. 51) pixels, retinal venular caliber was 8. 58 (0. 69) pixels, vertical <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was 73. 02 (7. 48) pixels, and vertical CDR was 0. 34 (0. 09). In multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, and birth weight, arteriolar caliber decreased by 0. 011 pixel (P < 0. 001) and venular caliber decreased by 0. 016 pixel (P < 0. 001), for each pixel decrease in vertical optic <b>disc</b> <b>diameter.</b> The associations remained similar and statistically significant with further adjustment for blood pressure. Vertical CDR was not related to retinal vascular caliber. CONCLUSIONS. In this population of generally healthy children, smaller vertical optic <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was associated with narrower retinal arteriolar and venular calibers. The findings of this study, in conjunction with studies in adults, suggest anatomic relationships between the optic disc and retinal vasculature that may provide additional insights into the vascular etiology of glaucomatous and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. However, because the detected differences in retinal vascular caliber were small, the clinical significance of the study findings remains uncertain.

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{distance}} between the optic disc center and the fovea (DFD) and to assess its associations. The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals aged 50 + years. The DFD was measured on fundus photographs. Readable fundus photographs were available for 2836 (81. 8 %) individuals. Mean DFD was 4. 76 ± 0. 34 mm (median: 4. 74 mm; range: 3. 76 - 6. 53 mm). In multivariate analysis, longer DFD was associated with longer axial length (P< 0. 001; standardized correlation coefficient beta: 0. 62), higher prevalence of axially high myopia (P< 0. 001; beta: 0. 06), shallower anterior chamber depth (P< 0. 001; beta:- 0. 18), thinner lens thickness (P = 0. 004; beta: - 0. 06), smaller optic disc-fovea angle (P = 0. 02; beta: - 0. 04), larger parapapillary alpha zone (P = 0. 008; beta: 0. 05), larger parapapillary beta/gamma zone (P< 0. 001; beta: 0. 11), larger optic disc area (P< 0. 001; beta: 0. 08), lower degree of cortical cataract (P = 0. 002; beta: - 0. 08), and lower prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (P = 0. 001; beta: - 0. 06). Bruch´s membrane opening-fovea distance (DFD minus disc radius minus parapapillary beta/gamma zone width) in non-glaucomatous eyes was not significantly (P = 0. 60) related with axial length in emmetropic or axially myopic eyes (axial length ≥ 23. 5 mm), while it increased significantly (P< 0. 001; r: 0. 32) with longer axial length in eyes with an axial length of < 23. 5 mm. Ratio of mean DFD to <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was 2. 65 ± 0. 30. If the ratio of disc-fovea distance to <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was considered constant and if the individual <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> was calculated as the individual disc-fovea distance divided by the constant factor of 2. 65, the resulting calculated <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> differed from the directly measured <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> by 0. 16 ± 0. 13 mm (median: 0. 13 mm, range: 0. 00 - 0. 89 mm) or 8. 9 ± 7. 3 % (median: 7. 4 %; range: 0. 00 - 70 %) of the measured <b>disc</b> <b>diameter.</b> DFD (mean: 4. 76 mm) increases with longer axial length, larger parapapillary alpha zone and parapapillary beta/gamma zone, and larger disc area. The axial elongation associated increase in DFD was due to an enlargement of parapapillary beta/gamma zone while the Bruch's membrane opening-fovea distance did not enlarge with longer axial length. This finding may be of interest for the process of emmetropization and myopization. Due to its variability, the disc-fovea distance has only limited clinical value as a relative size unit for structures at the posterior pole...|$|R

Using blaZ PCR as the reference standard, the sensitivities of the tests for detection of penicillinase production were as follows: Cefinase disc test, 24 / 38 isolates (63 %); P 10 disc zone edge test, 34 / 38 isolates (89 %); P 10 <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> test, 25 / 38 isolates (66 %); P 1 disc zone edge test, 38 / 38 isolates (100 %); and P 1 <b>disc</b> <b>diameter</b> test, 38 / 38 isolates (100 %).
