5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

25|$|Methamphetamine induces a {{psychosis}} in 26–46 {{percent of}} heavy users. Some {{of these people}} develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those {{who have had a}} short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> onto methamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird {{toyed with the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall was going to the University of Texas, so she {{chartered}} a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly {{fell in love with the}} city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, such as Orange Jackets, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.|$|E
25|$|A former Allhallows student, {{the actor}} Arthur Chudleigh, often visited {{the school and}} gave the boys free tickets to his shows. Harris {{received}} such a ticket in 1909, and {{went to see the}} play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fiancée and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father (who had just retired and returned to England) that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Allhallows for the new term. Harris's father was disappointed, having had in mind a military or civil service career for his son, but reluctantly agreed.|$|E

25|$|By this time, Kublai Khan had {{defeated}} Ariq Böke, {{and both}} Kublai and Phagpa {{must have felt}} that {{the construction of the}} stupa in the Sakya monastery had gained religious merit that contributed to Kublai's military victory and other achievements. As Imperial Preceptor, Phagpa was ready to go to the court and disseminate his sect's teachings. Since no artist in China could make the bewildering array of Himalayan Tantric deities which would be indispensable for his religious activities, he needed to bring with him someone who could. Arniko was a natural choice. Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Nepal, Phagpa encouraged him to go to the Mongol court to present himself to Kublai Khan. Phagpa accepted Arniko as his disciple and initiated him into secret Buddhist treaties, thus elevating his social status above an ordinary artisan. Thus having discovered Arniko, Phagpa personally prepared and trained Arniko for his future tasks at the court.|$|E
25|$|Gates' {{position}} on highway construction {{came to be}} at odds with the more conservative wing of the party. The federal government offered matching funds to the state to build certain highways, but they feared taking the money would be seen as a sign <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on their promise to not let the federal government influence them. Gates insisted that it was {{in the best interest of}} the state to accept the money and build the highways, but legislature failed to act on his recommendation. Jenners had been behind the movement to stop the highway construction bill, and Gates retaliated by planning to block Jenners from winning the nomination to run for governor in 1948. The Constitution of Indiana prevented governors from serving consecutive terms, barring Gates from running for office again. However, he still controlled the state party and at the state convention in 1948, he was able to unite the three factions opposing Jenners to deny him the nomination. Jenners, who had a two-hundred vote lead in the first ballot, was outraged and never forgave Gates.|$|E
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E

25|$|Agha Mohammad Khan at {{the same}} time marched {{directly}} on Tbilisi, with half of the army he crossed the Aras river with, though other estimations mention 40,000 instead of 35,000, and attacked the heavily fortified Georgian positions of Erekle and Solomon on the southwestern limits of the city. Abandoned by several of his nobles, Heraclius II managed to mobilize around 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 auxiliaries from neighbouring Imereti under its King Solomon II, a member of the Georgian Bagrationi Dynasty and thus distantly related to Heraclius II. The Georgians offered a desperate resistance and succeeded in rolling back a series of Persian attacks on September 9 and 10. After that, it is said that some traitors informed the Persians that the Georgians had no more strength to fight and the Qajars army cancelled their plan <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Persia, which they previously had. Early on September 11, Agha Mohammad Khan personally led an all-out offensive against the Georgians. Amid an artillery duel and a fierce cavalry charge, the Persians managed to cross the Kura River and outflanked the decimated Georgian army. Heraclius II attempted to mount a counterattack, but he had to retreat to the last available positions in the outskirts of Tbilisi. By nightfall, the Georgian forces had been exhausted and almost completely destroyed. The last surviving Georgian artillery briefly held the advancing Persians to allow Heraclius II and his retinue of some 150 men to escape through the city to the mountains. The fighting continued in the streets of Tbilisi and at the fortress of Narikala. In a few hours, Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital which was completely sacked and its population massacred. The Persian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off some 15,000 captives. The Georgians had lost 4,000 men in the battle, the Iranians 13,000; a third of their total force.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{arrives in}} Salem in April 2012 and bumps into Abigail Deveraux who helps him track down his half-sister, Lexie Carver at the hospital. Cameron is {{shocked to learn}} that Lexie has an {{inoperable}} brain tumor. Cameron and Abby bump into one another again when he is working {{the bar at the}} Brady pub; he explains that he sometimes helps out when they are short staffed; as Cameron and Abby tease one another, they develop an attraction. Lexie's other half-brother, Chad DiMera and his girlfriend, Melanie decide to show Cameron around and he ends up on a double date with Abby where he saves her from choking on popcorn. Meanwhile, Lexie's health continues declining and Cameron promises {{to spend more time with}} his nephew Theo before and after Lexie is gone. Celeste notices the growing closeness between Cameron and Abby, and warns Cameron that she will only cause him trouble. Despite Celeste's warnings, the two begin seeing each other and share their first kiss in late May 2012. In June 2012, Abby comforts Cameron when Lexie passes away, much to Celeste's dismay. Instead <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> home, Cameron chooses to relocate to Salem permanently, mainly to stay close Theo and Abby, despite Celeste warning him against getting involved with her. However, Abby is afraid to get too serious with Cameron believing he will eventually leave town. In early July, Cameron assures her that he is staying in Salem for several reasons, but mainly so they can be together. Cameron supports Abby when her father Jack suddenly dies. During her grief, Abby struggles with her emotions and has trouble being intimate with him. Realizing Abby needs to get help before their relationship can go any further, Cameron breaks up with her. During the holidays, Cameron and Chad bond over their memories of Lexie. Cameron later rekindles his relationship with Abby but when she admits to him that she has feelings for her ex Chad, he gives her time to choose between them, just as they both compete for Abigail's affection. On 9 August 2013, after doing a test on Chad, Cameron finds out that Chad has a brain tumor, he requests Cameron to keep it a secret, to which he agrees. Just as Abigail makes up her choice and is about to choose Cameron, he breaks things off with her and pushes her to Chad's arms.|$|E

500|$|Hall was in New York City and {{thinking}} <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to theatre work, {{and had no}} intention of returning to television so quickly. However, he changed his mind after reading the script, because he was [...] "intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor, chilling violence, and a unique central character." [...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct. He also watched people in New York restaurants {{to get a feel for}} what it would be like to stalk them.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} a polarized critical reaction. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great".

While displeased with Hearst's acting, he called the storyline [...] "good, fun stuff". He also enjoyed the emotional advancement of Veronica and Logan's relationship, writing that he showed genuine emotion in the episode, in contrast to his usual sarcastic demeanor. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching, called it [...] "one of the season's strongest episodes." [...] He elaborated, [...] "With Diane Ruggiero on script, you know there's going to be the funny [...] [...] Plus, we did get a Veronica/Keith team-up, just on the Mystery of the Week instead of the rape arc."

500|$|In July 1915, after {{political}} {{unrest and}} the mob murder of Haiti's president Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, United States marines invaded Haiti. Prior to the occupation peasants had staged uprisings to resist moves by US investors to appropriate {{their land and}} convert the style of agriculture in the area from subsistence back to a plantation-like system—the idea <b>of</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to anything like the plantation system faced fierce resistance. [...] Haitians had been afraid that US investors were trying to convert the economy back into a plantation-based one since US businesses had been amassing land and evicting rural peasants from their family land. [...] Rural Haitians formed armies that roamed around the countryside, stealing from farmers and raping women. [...] The motivation of the US occupation of Haiti was partly to protect investments and to prevent European countries from gaining too much power in the area. One stated justification for the occupation had been the practice of enslaving children as domestic servants; however the US then reinstituted the practice of forced labor under the corvée system.|$|E
500|$|For the film's [...] "negative" [...] response, David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews {{warned that}} the film was [...] "strictly for kids."

R.J. Carter of The Trades gave the film a B-, also stating that Dorothy's wish to become a star was a selfish one. Ultimate Disney's review found that the extended version of the film did more harm than good; Andy Dursin of The Aisle Seat said that the original film was [...] "dull" [...] and that the extended version was actually an improvement. Cold Fusion Video felt that although the film was entertaining, it lacked the heart and wit of Jim Henson's Muppet films. Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict said that the film drained the Muppets of their spirit and was slightly gratuitous.

Dr. Alliot, unlike Mêmê, did not comply with Marguerite Louise's plot to be sent to France, ostensibly for the thermal waters to ameliorate her [...] "illness."

The saga between them continued until 26 December 1674, after all attempts at conciliation failed, a beleaguered Cosimo agreed to allow his wife to depart for the Convent of Montemarte, France. The contract signed that day renounced her rights as a Princess of the Blood and with them the dignity Royal Highness. Cosimo granted her a pension of 80,000 livres in compensation.
