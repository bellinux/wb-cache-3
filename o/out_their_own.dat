However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This {{trade with the}} North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties {{prohibited}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E

5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E

The liberal wing of the NDL, and later the Russian Society of Latvia (N.Berejanski, S.Mansyrev), called for a close co-operation with the whole of Latvian society.|$|E

These included Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams in England and Béla Bartók in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions. The Latviju dainas are extensively used in the classical choral works of Andrejs Jurāns, Jānis Cimze, and Emilis Melngailis.|$|E
25|$|The Assemblies of God has {{its roots}} in the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves forced outside existing religious bodies. These people sought <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> places of worship and founded hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations. By 1914, many ministers and laymen alike began to realize just how far-reaching the spread of the revival and of Pentecostalism had become. Concerned leaders felt the desire to protect and preserve the results of the revival by uniting through cooperative fellowship.|$|E

25|$|Public benefit {{corporations}} in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are {{a form of}} government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting {{so much of the}} credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.|$|E
25|$|To survive, {{resistance}} fighters largely {{relied on}} the civilian population. This included access to food, clothing and other supplies. However, in the areas they controlled, there was limited opportunity to operate their own farms. As is typical in guerrilla warfare, Soviet partisans requisitioned food, livestock and clothes from local peasants; {{in some cases the}} supply was voluntary, in others coerced. The results of such requisitioning were made more severe by the fact that Axis occupation forces had been already carrying <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> requisitions. This led to conflicts with partisans in areas hostile to Soviet power, mostly in territories annexed by the Soviet Union during 1939–1941.|$|E

Zimbabwean authorities later arrested Mann and claimed the sale had been approved {{as part of an}} elaborate sting operation. Nevertheless, the initial ease with which Mann had been able to negotiate the purchase without a licensed dealer or an end-user certificate aroused suspicion among South African investigators carrying <b>out</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> inquiry, condemning ZDI for its apparent carelessness.|$|E
