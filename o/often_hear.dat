25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line {{in order to get a}} more pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, where you can <b>often</b> <b>hear</b> a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, {{could not have}} been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not <b>often</b> <b>hear</b> a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E
25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could <b>often</b> <b>hear</b> songs from the original hippie era in the chill out rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E

Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E

2500|$|Tarantula hawks exemplify {{evolutionary}} {{success in}} insect defense. Justin Schmidt, from personal communication with John Alcock, the world’s leading Hemipepsis ustulata expert: “They are aposematic, brightly colored and odored, and have hard, closely fitting, smooth and slippery integumentary sclerites, live long, form defensive warning aggregations, and even have sharp and effective defensive leg spines.” There {{is no question}} they {{are some of the}} best-defended insects on earth. The well-documented descriptions of battles between tarantula hawk and tarantula evidence their defensive strength. In the jaws of {{one of the largest and}} most powerful spiders on earth, the tarantula hawk still almost invariably escapes unharmed. During their violent encounters, one can <b>often</b> <b>hear</b> loud crunching or snapping sounds as the tarantula attempts to crush the wasp in its jaws [...] Not a single wasp death in 200 tarantula encounters were recorded by Petrunkevitch, and only one wasp injury was observed in William’s extensive field studies.

2500|$|Most remote {{controls}} for electronic appliances use a near infrared diode to emit {{a beam of}} light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is invisible to the human eye, but picked up by sensors on the receiving device. Video cameras [...] see the diode as if it produces visible purple light. With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) {{remote controls}} more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequency. After the receiver demodulates the received signal, it applies the appropriate frequency filters to separate the respective signals. [...] One can <b>often</b> <b>hear</b> the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station. [...] Today, IR remote controls almost always use a pulse width modulated code, encoded and decoded by digital computer: a command from a remote control consists of a short train of pulses of carrier-present and carrier-not-present of varying widths.|$|E

Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s.
