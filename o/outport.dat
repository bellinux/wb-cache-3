25|$|Schools in Newfoundland, {{especially}} in <b>outport</b> settlements, faced many problems and obstacles. The {{success of the}} schools {{was influenced by the}} conditions within the settlement, and these conditions often affected student attendance, payments, learning, and so forth. For example, conditions which affected the population were such things as illnesses (or epidemics) such as the flu, fever, whooping cough, smallpox, measles, etc. The weather also posed problems, severe snowstorms in the winter months often closed schools for days; and if the weather was too cold, children could not make it to school or could not keep the school in fuel for heat. The fishery affected the school and its attendance greatly. During the fishing season, children were often needed to help out in the fishery and could not attend school. Also, in smaller settlements, the teacher was allowed to attend the fishery in order to supplement their low teaching salaries; therefore, closing the school during that season. A failure in the fishery also had severe consequences as parents could not pay subscriptions to the school. Poverty also led to a lack of clothes and shoes which meant children could not be sent to school. The N.S.S., unlike other schools, tried their best to counter these obstacles. For example, the N.S.S. would send shipments of clothes and shoes from England to Newfoundland to give to poverty-stricken families so their children could continue to attend school. Also, other schools in Newfoundland had trouble procuring and paying qualified teachers. The N.S.S., however, were able to recruite qualified teachers who were trained at the National School Society Training School in England {{and they were able to}} pay their teachers better salaries.|$|E
500|$|Prominent sinologists {{were also}} {{critical}} of the work. In the pages of The New York Times, Owen Lattimore condemned Ways That Are Dark as [...] "a general indictment of a whole race" [...] which lacks insight, contains factual errors, and relies on second-hand accounts. He stated that the book would [...] "only convince people who are convinced already." [...] Nathaniel Peffer likewise denounced the book as [...] "a rehash of all the old patter of the <b>outport</b> hotel lobbies, with all its half-truths, inaccuracies, provincialism, ignorance and sometimes crassness... has not managed to observe accurately the most simple and superficial things." [...] JOP Bland, though deeming Townsend's conclusions [...] "as a whole... unconvincing", at least found the chapter on opium [...] "particularly instructive." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 October, {{discouraged}} by {{the news of the}} fall of Chiayi, Liu Yung-fu made an offer of conditional surrender to the Japanese. [...] He asked that no Formosan should be punished for having taken up arms against the Japanese, and that all Chinese soldiers still in Taiwan should be treated hospitably and repatriated to Canton or Amoy. [...] The surrender offer was conveyed to the Japanese headquarters at Makung in the Pescadores by the British warship HMS Pique, and the Japanese replied that they would send a warship to Anping, the <b>outport</b> of Tainan, on 12 October to discuss Liu's proposals. [...] On 12 October the Japanese cruiser Yoshino arrived off Anping, but Liu Yung-fu refused to go aboard, perhaps fearing treachery. [...] The Japanese subsequently informed him that they would accept only unconditional surrender.|$|E

Numerous villas, parks, and country-houses had begun to decorate the Cairo bank of the stream ere this: residences of the Pasha's nobles, who have had orders to take their pleasure here and beautify the precincts of the capital; tall factory chimneys also rise here; there are foundries and steam-engine manufactories. These, and the pleasure-houses, stand as trim as soldiers on parade; contrasting with the swarming, slovenly, close, tumble-down, Eastern old town, that forms the <b>outport</b> of Cairo, and was built before the importation of European taste and discipline.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the fishing}} and drying season, {{members of the}} shore party were able to {{increase}} their profits for the voyage by trading with First Nations residents bringing furs to the <b>outport.</b> As Grand Banks fishing increased, the best <b>outport</b> locations might be secured for future use if part of the shore party would volunteer to winter-over in the <b>outport</b> and keep the fishing stage, drying platforms, storage sheds, and small boats in good repair. Surviving a winter in the <b>outport</b> was easier for men who found friendly Mi'kmaq {{to teach them to}} find and preserve the local berries to prevent scurvy. Some <b>outport</b> caretakers returned to Europe after wintering over, while others [...] "went native" [...] and remained in Newfoundland Jacques Cartier was offered furs by indigenous residents of Chaleur Bay in 1534, indicating previous experience with European fur traders; and Cartier found members of the Montagnais First Nation engaged in fishing for a French Captain Thiennot. On his return voyage in 1536, Cartier left one of his larger ships' boats at Renewse Harbor, Newfoundland, indicating the <b>outport</b> was already in use as a used boat exchange for fishing vessels needing boats for inshore fishing, but not wanting to transport them across the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{construction}} in the 1890s resulted {{in the creation of}} inland communities that relied on land-based natural resources. The <b>outports</b> began to see wholesale depopulation following cutbacks to ferry services and construction of roads throughout the island during and after the Second World War. Following Confederation in 1949, the government of premier Joey Smallwood pursued a policy of forced/encouraged resettlement of residents from <b>outports</b> to central inland communities where provision of schools, health care and other government services could be achieved more cheaply.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Component-based {{approaches}} for the software development are well-known up to now. Most {{of these approaches}} (like CORBA and COM++) focus on {{the realization of the}} connection between the components and their interactions. In this paper we concentrate on the missing items in the componentbased software engineering: the problem how to model component composition and to validate them. We apply the component model based on the interface description with InPorts and <b>OutPorts</b> which allow a rather detailed definition of the components interaction. Moreover we take the term feature to name the core requirements to a component. Features are used to drive the description of the component composition which is regarded as an combination of features expressed by logical operators. Moreover the InPorts and <b>OutPorts</b> describe the dynamic component interactions. The combination of <b>OutPorts</b> and InPorts according to the component composition rules allows to reason about the component systems dynamic behavior. ...|$|R
