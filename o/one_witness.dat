In 1900 the extended family moved to Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. According to Jones-Sneed, Laura and Austin were listed in the 1910 census as having two children, L.

5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. <b>One</b> <b>witness</b> claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{alleges that}} murder {{as a crime}} against humanity took place in Nakuru and Naivasha. He alleges that approximately 112 people were killed in Nakuru between 24 and 27 January 2008 and that by 31 January at least 50 people had been killed in Naivasha. <b>One</b> <b>witness</b> testified that 23 people died in Naivasha from burns including 19 who died in a single arson attack on the Kabati estate.

5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. <b>One</b> <b>witness</b> said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Tilley took {{leave in}} June 1901 {{to return to}} Washington, leaving E. J. Dorn in command. Dorn {{subsequently}} had medical issues {{and was replaced by}} J. L. Jayne in October. That month, an anonymous complaint was made to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Frank W. Hackett against Commandant Tilley, alleging immorality and drunkenness. Almost simultaneously, he was promoted to captain by President Theodore Roosevelt. Tilley returned to Samoa on November 7, 1901 with his wife, and two days later was given a court martial. The trial lasted four days and only <b>one</b> <b>witness</b> was called for the prosecution. Ultimately, he was acquitted. Despite this, Captain Uriel Sebree was appointed as commandant on November 27, 1901. Tilley and his wife returned to the United States the following month.|$|E

5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to <b>one</b> <b>witness,</b> the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1997, the {{prosecution}} {{began to call}} more witnesses. Although attendance did not abate, most observers were police officers or paid spectators. <b>One</b> <b>witness,</b> {{who claimed to have}} participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, {{the prosecution}} withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge of}} murder {{as a crime}} against {{humanity}} was made by the prosecutor in relation to multiple attacks {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the election.

Additionally the prosecutor alleges that network members attacked the Huruma, Kiambaa, Kimumu, Langas and Yamumbi areas of Eldoret, resulting in 70 to 87 deaths. It is alleged that during the attack in Kaimbaa several people took refuge in a church which was locked from outside and then burned down causing between 17 and 35 people to be burned to death. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that the towns of Kapsabet and Nandi Hills town were attacked by network members.|$|E

5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. <b>One</b> <b>witness</b> observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E
