Furthermore, the Mishnah taught that if anyone unintentionally erred or was {{prevented}} from observing and thus did not <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> first Passover, then that person was obliged to <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> second Passover. The Mishnah asked why then [...] specified that people [...] "unclean by reason of [...] a dead body or on a distant journey" [...] <b>observed</b> <b>the</b> second Passover. The Mishnah answered that it was to teach that those [...] "unclean by reason of [...] a dead body or on a distant journey" [...] were exempt from being cut off from their kin, while those who deliberately failed to <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> Passover were liable to being cut off from their kin.|$|R

Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E

As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
