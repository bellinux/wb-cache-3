5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the <b>Ordination</b> <b>of</b> Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Gregory faced {{opposition}} to his reign in Nyssa, and, in 373 Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium had {{to visit the}} city to quell discontent. In 375 Desmothenes of Pontus convened a synod at Ancyra to try Gregory on charges of embezzlement of church funds and irregular <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> bishops. He was arrested by imperial troops {{in the winter of}} the same year, but escaped to an unknown location. The synod of Nyssa, which was convened in the spring of 376, deposed him. However, Gregory regained his see in 378, perhaps due to an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor Gratian. In the same year Basil died, and despite the relative unimportance of Nyssa, Gregory took over many of his brother's former responsibilities in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, 15 {{conservative}} Episcopal churches {{voted to}} split from the Diocese of Virginia over the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim {{affiliation with the}} larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided {{in favor of the}} mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.|$|E

5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> women as lay elders.|$|E
5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> women.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

5|$|When Bede {{was about}} 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would {{probably}} have met the abbot during this visit, {{and it may be}} that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.|$|E
5|$|In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to {{fill the}} vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be too {{powerful}} as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The election took place on 24December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia, and {{a small group of}} barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election's timing to ensure Henry's absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen's concerns but also because Waleran of Meulan, the lay patron of Bec, was attempting to put his own man {{in one of the most}} powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry's chief rivals for Stephen's favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.|$|E
