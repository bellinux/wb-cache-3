40|$|AbstractA transient, decompensated {{vertical}} phoria in {{an individual}} with infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) resulted in two images that oscillated vertically—a diplopic oscillopsia. Ocular motor studies during the vertical oscillopsia recreated by vertical prisms, led to the identification of a sub-clinical see-saw nystagmus (SSN), present under the prism-induced diplopic condition. Retrospective analysis of ocular motor recordings made prior to the above episode of vertical diplopia revealed the presence of that same sub-clinical SSN. The SSN had not been detected previously despite extensive observations and recordings of this subject’s pendular IN {{over a period of}} forty years. Three- dimensional search-coil data from fourteen additional INS subjects (with pendular and jerk waveforms) confirmed the existence of sub-clinical SSN embedded within the clinically detectable horizontal-torsional IN in seven of the fifteen and a sub-clinical, conjugate, vertical component in the remaining eight. Unlike the clinically visible SSN found in achiasma, the cause of this sub-clinical SSN is hypothesized to be due to a failure of the forces of the oblique muscles (responsible for the torsional component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>IN)</b> <b>to</b> balance out the associated forces of the vertical recti; the net result is a small, sub-clinical SSN. Thus, so-called “horizontal” IN is actually a horizontal-torsional oscillation with a secondary, sub-clinical SSN or conjugate vertical component. The suppression of oscillopsia by efference copy in INS appears to be accomplished for each eye individually, even in a binocular individual. However, failure to fuse the two images results in oscillopsia of one of them...|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 2004, Soriano had six hits in nine innings—the first Texas Ranger to do so—in a 16–15, 10-inning {{victory over}} the Detroit Tigers. The game {{featured}} an hour-long fifth inning, where Detroit scored eight runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inning</b> <b>to</b> take a ten-run lead over the Rangers, only to see Texas score ten runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inning</b> <b>to</b> tie <b>the</b> game, the largest deficit ever overcome by the Rangers and tying an MLB record for most runs in an inning by two teams. [...] That same year, Soriano {{was elected to the}} All-Star Game as the starting second baseman. He hit a three-run home run off Roger Clemens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>inning</b> and was named <b>the</b> MVP <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|R
