5|$|The cross-in-square plan, with {{a single}} dome at the {{crossing}} or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 {{as part of a}} substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern, with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia.|$|E
5|$|In the West, the Muslims {{continued}} to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced {{to rely on the}} aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress. Following the fall of Enna in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. Syracuse was attacked again in 869, and in 870, Malta fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of Apulia, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting marble for the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia, Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the droungarios Nasar, scored a significant victory in a night battle over the Aghlabids who were raiding the Ionian Islands. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before defeating another Muslim fleet off Punta Stilo. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and Calabria and forming the thema of Longobardia, which would later evolve into the Catepanate of Italy. A heavy defeat off Milazzo in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.|$|E

40|$|Main-belt asteroids and cometary nuclei {{are both}} {{frequently}} suggested sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively short-lived near-earth asteroids (<b>NEAs).</b> <b>The</b> asteroidal origin hypothesis is studied by obtaining new high-quality reflectivity spectra of 19 NEAs and 23 asteroids near the 3 : 1 resonance, and by performing a systematic comparison {{of these two}} groups of spectra.

25|$|The Florida Education Association was {{established}} in 1886 as an affiliate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NEA.</b> It was an association rather than a labor union, and membership was initially limited to white teachers and administrators only.

25|$|Local {{affiliates}} of the FEA {{formed in}} almost every school district. However, membership remained low and varied widely from district to district, even though dues were not high. FEA, like much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NEA</b> at the time, was dominated by administrators rather than rank-and-file teachers. The administrators' influence often kept FEA from being an effective advocate for classroom teachers. But in larger school districts, the FEA was somewhat successful in obtaining occasional salary increases, improvements to facilities, and curriculum changes. However the FEA {{in its early years}} was seen more as a proponent of white teachers specifically. They opposed the efforts of African-American teachers to sue for salary equalization in the 1940s, with their frequent petitions of interventions designed to delay the outcomes of many cases that eventually prevented schools from maintaining separate unequal salary schedule for white and black teachers.|$|E

500|$|The katholikon of Nea Moni, {{a monastery}} {{on the island}} of Chios, was built some time between 1042 and 1055 and {{featured}} a nine sided, ribbed dome rising [...] above the floor (this collapsed in 1881 and was replaced with the slightly taller present version). The transition from the square naos to the round base of the drum is accomplished by eight conches, with those above the flat sides of the naos being relatively shallow and those in the corners of the being relatively narrow. The novelty of this technique in Byzantine architecture has led to it being dubbed the [...] "island octagon" [...] type, in contrast to the [...] "mainland octagon" [...] type of Hosios Loukas. Speculation on design influences have ranged from Arab influence transmitted via the recently built domed octagon chapels at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Al-Hakim Mosque in Islamic Cairo, to Caucasian buildings such as the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.

The AFT convinced FEA president-elect Louise Alford to leave FEA and work for the AFT, and later persuaded Richard Batchelder (a former president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NEA)</b> to do the same.

2500|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia (New Church) in the Great Palace of Constantinople, {{built around}} 880, {{has often been}} described as crucial to {{the dominance of the}} cross-in-square plan in the medieval period; however, the building has not survived, its actual form is much disputed, and {{it is by no means}} certain that it was a genuine cross-in-square. Whatever the reasons, the cross-in-square had come to dominate church-building by the later ninth century, perhaps in part because its relatively small scale suited the intrinsically [...] "private" [...] nature of Byzantine piety. The achievements of later Byzantine architecture have been described as [...] "the elaboration of a type of church that was, in its own way, perfect." [...] The near-universal acceptance of the cross-in-square plan in the Byzantine world does not, however, imply the stagnation of artistic creativity, as the numerous variations on the type (described above) demonstrate. These variations seem to represent, not so much a linear evolution of forms, as a series of sensitive responses to various local factors.|$|E
