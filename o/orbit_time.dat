50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a timing mark on the machine shaft (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings. To enable them to look at this data in a more simplified form vibration analysts or machinery diagnostic engineers have adopted a number of mathematical plots to show machine problems and running characteristics, these plots include the bode plot, the waterfall plot, the polar plot and the <b>orbit</b> <b>time</b> base plot amongst others.|$|E

40|$|A viable {{nuclear fusion}} reactor must confi ne {{energetic}} plasmas long {{enough so that}} the fusion energy produced exceeds the energy consumed to heat the plasma and maintain confi nement. It is well-known that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or plasma fl uid instabilities limit confi nement. One such important instability is the resistive wall mode (RWM). Plasma rotation faster than a critical frequency has been observed to stabilize the RWM. Some theories predict that the critical frequency will vary inversely with the characteristic times particles take to orbit the plasma. Previous calculations of these <b>orbit</b> <b>times</b> have assumed high aspect ratio and circular plasma cross-section, approximations unsuitable for the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). Analytic solutions for the <b>orbit</b> <b>times</b> have been derived as functions of particle energy and magnetic moment for low aspect ratio and elliptical cross-sections. Numeric solutions for arbitrary aspect ratio and cross-sectional geometry were also computed using Mathematica and IDL and agree with the analytic forms. In typical parameter regimes for NSTX, the generalized <b>orbit</b> <b>times</b> can differ from the high aspect ratio, circular approximations {{by as much as}} 40 %. This result might help to assess how accurately theory describes RWM stabilization in NSTX.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) experiment, {{which has been in}} orbit at Mars since early 2002, is to identify minerals associated with hydrothermal and subaqueous environments. Data from THEMIS have supported the presence of clays, silica-rich deposits, and chlorides but has not before provided definitive evidence for the presence of sulfates. This is an especially puzzling result given that sulfates have been extensively identified with other instruments at Mars. If present, sufficiently exposed, and in high enough abundances, such minerals should be detectable in orbital thermal infrared spectra at the resolution of THEMIS. The extended mission proposal for THEMIS on Mars Odyssey suggests that the detection of all minerals may be enhanced by observing at an earlier time of day and thus at warmer temperatures. Therefore, in 2009, Odyssey moved to an earlier <b>orbit</b> <b>time.</b> Here, we examine THEMIS data collected when the earlier <b>orbit</b> <b>time</b> coincided with the Martian local (southern) late summer (Ls = 270) for Columbus crater where Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) data have detected a number of aqueous minerals. Some of the warmest THEMIS images show evidence for aqueous minerals, although not in the same locations where CRISM finds the highest concentrations. Several factors contribute to this result, including differences in the diurnal temperature curve and levels of induration and particle size. For THEMIS, earlier time-of-day and proper seasonal observations combine to provide warm surface temperatures and ideal low atmospheric opacity that significantly increases the ability to definitively identify low spectral contrast aqueous minerals at the surface of Mars...|$|E

The {{focus is on the}} long-term stability of the <b>orbit</b> <b>time</b> series for mean sea level applications on a regional scale. We discuss various issues related to the assessment of radial orbit error trends; in particular this study reviews orbit errors dependent on the tracking technique, with an aim to monitoring the long-term stability of all available tracking systems operating on Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 (GPS, DORIS, SLR). The reference frame accuracy and its effect on Jason orbit is assessed. We also examine the impact of analysis method on the inference of Geographically Correlated Errors as well as the significance of estimated radial orbit error trends versus the time span of the analysis. Thus a long-term error budget of the 10 -year Jason- 1 and Envisat GDR-D <b>orbit</b> <b>time</b> series is provided for two time scales: interannual and decadal. As the temporal variations of the geopotential remain one of the primary limitations in the Precision Orbit Determination modeling, the overall accuracy of the Jason- 1 and Jason- 2 GDR-D solutions is evaluated through comparison with external orbits based on different time-variable gravity models. This contribution is limited to an East-West "order- 1 " pattern at the 2 mm/y level (secular) and 4 mm level (seasonal), over the Jason- 2 lifetime. The possibility of achieving sub-mm/y radial orbit stability over interannual and decadal periods at regional scales and the challenge of evaluating such an improvement using in situ independent data is discussed...|$|E
