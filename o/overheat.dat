5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can <b>overheat</b> if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot <b>overheat</b> due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds.

40|$|A new {{indicator}} of <b>overheating</b> risk is introduced that more comprehensively represents heat stress {{and the way}} thermal environment is experienced. This indicator is compared with the industry standard <b>overheating</b> assessment approach (CIBSE TM 52). This is demonstrated using an energy retrofit simulation case study of a typical London, UK terraced dwelling under different climate scenarios. <b>Overheating</b> was evaluated first according to TM 52, then via an assessment of continuously <b>overheated</b> intervals (COIs) that account for the duration where adaptive limits are continuously exceeded. Results for the case study show that, first, extent of <b>overheating</b> can vary greatly based on climate uncertainties. Second, insulation retrofit only contributes to substantial <b>overheating</b> when the space lacks proper ventilation or protection from solar radiation. Nevertheless, <b>overheating</b> cannot be avoided completely under future climate scenarios even with appropriate passive cooling. More importantly, {{the results show that}} <b>overheated</b> hours tend to occur consecutively. This implies that violations of TM 52 criterion 1 (which currently applies only at the seasonal scale) can occur at the monthly/weekly resolutions. This ‘buried’ information can be revealed via the COI approach to more comprehensively capture how an <b>overheating</b> situation unfolds in a manner more relevant to heat stress and occupants’ thermal experience.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical study {{to assess the}} occurrence and possible causes of summertime <b>overheating</b> in three occupied and two unoccupied low energy dwellings in the UK. All five dwellings are identical in terms of construction and location, but have different occupancy profiles and household compositions in the three occupied dwellings. An interdisciplinary approach is adopted, drawing from building science and social science methods, including monitoring of interior environmental conditions, thermal comfort diaries and interviews with residents. Temperature data from bedrooms and living rooms from the case study homes were analysed for <b>overheating</b> using both static and adaptive thermal comfort analyses methods. The findings suggest that summertime <b>overheating</b> is prevalent across both occupied and unoccupied case study dwellings, although <b>overheating</b> assessment using static criteria found a much higher proportion of the rooms to be <b>overheated</b> than the adaptive criteria. In the dwellings a common finding was that bedrooms {{were found to be}} more prone to <b>overheating</b> than living rooms. Since it is likely that methods used to assess <b>overheating</b> will be incorporated into regulations in future affecting the design of housing, it is necessary to deploy passive design strategies to prevent the <b>overheating</b> risk in low energy homes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Overheating</b> is a {{phenomenon}} of rising of temperature in an electric circuit (or portion of a circuit). <b>Overheating</b> causes potential damage to the circuit components, and can cause fire, explosion, or injury.

5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they <b>overheat,</b> they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E

5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing.

Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service.

40|$|Regardless of {{the cause}} of <b>overheating,</b> the general and primary effect of <b>overheating</b> on an {{electronic}} component is damage.

Take note that included in this discussion are the causes of <b>overheating</b> to better understand and appreciate the <b>overheating</b> phenomenon {{as it applies to}} electronic components, as well as electronic assemblies and electronic devices. Through a review of literature, especially studies and engineering reference materials, this paper found out that at the micro-level, <b>overheating</b> causes material degradation on or in a specific electronic component. This degradation is further caused by cracks, expansion, and other structural deformation. Note that this degradation is also caused by different changes in the physical and chemical properties of a specific material due to exposure to high levels of heat.

5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to <b>overheat</b> a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to <b>overheat</b> and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E

The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E

The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine <b>overheat</b> condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E
40|$|In {{the drive}} to reduce {{space-heating}} demand and associated CO 2 emissions as well as tackle fuel poverty, dwelling <b>overheating</b> and summer-time occupant thermal discomfort might be the unintended consequences of low-energy building retrofits. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} steady-state modelled low energy retrofit dwelling in northern England and its potential current and future climate <b>overheating</b> risks using UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP 09) scenarios (2050 and 2080 High Emission Scenarios). Predictive findings highlight that retrofitting to low energy standards increases <b>overheating</b> risk over time, unless passive prevention measures are included in the retrofit design. In addition, the steady-state nature of the model might not fully capture the occupants’ exposure to actual future <b>overheating</b> risks. Among the most effective individual passive <b>overheating</b> mitigation strategies are temporary internal shading, permanent external shading, and night-time ventilation. Most effective is a combination of these adaptation measures, so that predictive <b>overheating</b> is minimised in a future changing climate, reducing the uptake of active cooling in retrofitted dwellings. Practical applications: Much research focuses on building <b>overheating</b> risks in the warmer South-east of England. However, this paper highlights how dwelling retrofit in north England (Sheffield) also can lead to increased dwelling <b>overheating</b> risk, unless passive design measures are included in the retrofit design. Among the most effective individual passive <b>overheating</b> mitigation strategies are solar shading devices and increased night-time ventilation, though ideally different measures are combined.

5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can <b>overheat</b> and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they <b>overheat</b> if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent.
