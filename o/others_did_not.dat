5|$|Mughal cavalry used {{gunpowder}} weapons, {{but were}} slow to replace the traditional composite bow. Under the impact of European military successes in India, some Indian rulers adopted the European system of massed cavalry charges, although <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> By the 18th century, Indian armies continued to field cavalry, but mainly of the heavy variety.|$|E
5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes {{similar to those}} by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number {{of economic and political}} concessions. The protests started with a sit-in in solidarity with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of the}} Egyptian embassy in the capital, Manama ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of Manama.|$|E
5|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> discuss the topic. Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
5|$|The Cylinder {{itself is}} part of a {{continuous}} Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings. Some contained messages, while <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection.|$|E

5|$|The axiom of {{foundation}} {{proposed that}} every set {{can be constructed}} {{from the bottom up}} in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in set theory.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|The next day, August 16, {{the prisoners}} were moved with their guards. One of the mortarmen, Cpl. Roy L. Day Jr., spoke Japanese {{and was able to}} {{converse}} with some of the North Koreans. That afternoon he overheard a North Korean lieutenant say that they would kill the prisoners if other American forces advanced too close. Later that day other American forces began to assault Hill 303 to retake the position. B Company and several American tanks tried a second time to retake the hill, now estimated to contain a 700-man battalion. The 61st Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion fired on the hill during the day. That night, G Company succeeded in escaping from Hill 303. Guards took away five of the American prisoners; the <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know what became of them.|$|E

5|$|Post-war {{development}} was different in southern Indiana. The state's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war, {{especially after the}} closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade with the South and increased competition from the state's expanding railroad network. Some of Indiana's river towns, such as Evansville, recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River, but <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce with the South, but its trade dwindled during the war. After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South. New Albany's formerly robust steamboat-building industry ended in 1870; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee. New Albany never regained its pre-war stature; its population leveled off at 40,000, and only the antebellum, early-Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{news of the}} storm, {{businesses}} in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200–5,000 residents, {{most of whom were}} black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. Aday before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many <b>others</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels.|$|E
