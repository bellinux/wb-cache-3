5|$|When a room is {{occupied}} {{only by a}} single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those {{who would like to}} be penetrated anally ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive fellatio might lie face up.|$|E
5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>with</b> an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E

500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She woke {{early in the morning}} and checked into a hotel room, where the staff was {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. She wrote on legal pads while lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>with</b> only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged ten to twelve pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She composed all her works this way, both prose and poetry.|$|E

Since they only could get a very early dinner reservation, Claire realizes that all the couples are elderly so she decides to bring back their characters from last year, Clive Bixby and Julianna. Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a bottle of champagne. The older woman then walks in after coming back from the bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act like themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The pose of Venus had {{precedents}} in {{a well-known}} classical relief called il letto di Polyclito (the Bed of Polyclitus), where the female is Psyche (though in the 16th century {{thought to be}} Venus with Vulcan). [...] She sits on a bed containing her sleeping partner, and twists round to see him, supporting herself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> one arm, and lifting the covers with the other. Titian had various opportunities to see versions or copies of this very well-known composition. [...] It had already been used by Raphael's workshop in their frescos in the Villa Farnesina in Rome, for Hebe in the Feast of the Gods. [...] Giulio Romano had used it in the Palazzo del Tè in Mantua, for a Baachus and Ariadne. [...] Titian rarely comes so close to quoting another work.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{believed}} {{that all of}} the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep when murdered. They thought that she was awake and tried to fight back, as she was found lying crosswise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and <b>with</b> a defensive wound on her arm. Lena's nightgown was pushed up to her waist and she was wearing no undergarments, leading to law enforcement speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} access scaffold {{required to}} complete the works had to consider the ancient monument status of the bridge so was unable to be tied into the structure.

Rate of erosion is proportional to shear velocity, when their values are large, but not so whensmall.
