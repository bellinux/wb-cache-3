5|$|The maximum {{tenure in}} office was nine years, but {{every three years}} {{officials}} were graded on their performance by senior officials. If they were graded as superior then they were promoted, if graded adequate then they retained their ranks, and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank. In extreme cases, officials would be dismissed or punished. Only capital officials <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> 4 and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation, although {{they were expected to}} confess any of their faults. There were over 4,000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years. The Chief Instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a second-grade county graduate. The Supervisorate of Imperial Instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne; this office was headed by a Grand Supervisor of Instruction, who was ranked as first class <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> three.|$|E

5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout <b>of</b> <b>Grade,</b> their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> repetition and dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom. Public expenditure on education was 13.4percent of total government expenditure and 2.9percent of GDP in 2008. Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.|$|E
40|$|The Elementary School Act {{determines the}} method <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> in school {{subjects}} including Physical Education (PE).

We also wanted to find out the differences among teachers who teach {{in the first and}} the second triad as well as the differences among the teachers with different length of employment. The sample included 855 primary school teachers. The results showed that teachers mostly agree with the method <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> that is currently valid. As the second most recommended way <b>of</b> <b>grading,</b> the grading with word-grading on a three-level grading scale was proposed for the first as well as the second triad. This method, however, has not been used in Slovenia {{for a number of years}} now. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of individual methods <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> we can assume, however, that some teachers have insufficient knowledge of the purpose <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> in PE.

5|$|The {{local council}} {{operates}} a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend {{one of the}} 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school. Bournemouth {{is one of the}} minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education, with two grammar schools (one for boys, one for girls) and ten secondary modern/comprehensive schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college. Bournemouth has two universities: Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth, both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole. They are also home to AECC University College (formally known as Anglo European College of Chiropractic), which is located on Parkwood Road in Bournemouth. In 2012, 60.7% of the borough's school leavers gained 5 GCSEs <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> C or above.

5|$|There are 90 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Mendip. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers. The greatest concentrations <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> I listed buildings are in Wells and Glastonbury. In Wells these are clustered around the 10th-century Cathedral Church of St Andrew, better known as Wells Cathedral, and the 13th-century Bishop's Palace. Glastonbury is the site of the Abbey, where construction started in the 7th century, and its associated buildings. The ruined St Michael's church, damaged in an earthquake of 1275, stands on Glastonbury Tor, where the site shows evidence of occupation from Neolithic times and the Dark Ages. The Chalice Well has been in use since Pre-Christian times. Glastonbury Abbey had a wider influence outside the town: tithe barns were built at Pilton and West Bradley to hold tithes, and a Fish House was built at Meare along with a summer residence for the Abbot (now Manor Farmhouse).|$|E
