5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum <b>of</b> <b>logic,</b> classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
40|$|The {{major concern}} in the study <b>of</b> {{categories}} <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> is to describe condition for preservation, under the a method <b>of</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>logics,</b> <b>of</b> meta-logical properties. Our complementary approach to this field is study the "global" aspects <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> in the vein of the categories,, _s studied in AFLM 3. All these categories have good properties however the category <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> does not allow a good treatment of the "identity problem" for logics (Bez) : for instance, the presentations of "classical logics" (e. g., in the signature {, ∨} and {',→'}) are not -isomorphic. In this work, we sketch a possible way to overcome this "defect" (and anothers) by a mathematical device: a representation theory <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> obtained from category theoretic aspects on (Blok-Pigozzi) algebraizable logics. In this setting we propose the study of (left and right) "Morita equivalence" <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> and variants. We introduce the concepts <b>of</b> <b>logics</b> (left/right) -(stably) -Morita-equivalent and show that the presentations <b>of</b> classical <b>logics</b> are stably Morita equivalent but classical logics and intuitionist logics are not stably-Morita-equivalent: they are only stably-Morita-adjointly related.

5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type <b>of</b> <b>logic</b> that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
5|$|The college {{remained}} {{associated with}} Lancashire and Cheshire, {{with a particular}} preference for those from Prestbury and Prescot, the founders' birthplaces. This was also reflected in early benefactors. These included the donation of John Port, serjeant-at-law, for two fellowships for natives of Chester in 1522; that of William Clyfton, the sub-dean of York, for residents of York, Lincoln and Nottingham in 1538; and for the Brian Higden, Dean of York, who sponsored a fellowship for those in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire in 1549. Another notable benefactor during this period was John Claymond, the first President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, who in 1538 gave funds to maintain six scholars at Brasenose, provided that their lectures on humanity and Greek take place at his own college. Only in 1572 was a Lectureship in Greek established at Brasenose, symptomatic of a conservatism that attached Brasenose to a monastic teaching style that was increasingly problematic during the reformation. By {{the end of the}} sixteenth century, however, the college did boast lectureships ("public readerships") in the new disciplines <b>of</b> <b>logic</b> and natural philosophy. By 1547, the income of the college had increased to almost £200 yearly, with an endowment that placed it squarely in the midst of other colleges in size; it did, however, make a yearly loss.|$|E
