She {{believes}} she has met the man of her dreams, but her feelings are not reciprocated because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> is. Fairbank-Hynes said the storyline is interesting and funny. Stevie also sees Pippa as [...] "the cold-hearted 'other woman'" [...] who has stolen her boyfriend, but later discovers that she is [...] "actually human too and not some evil goddess whose sole intention is to steal boyfriends!" [...] McKee said that Pippa's role in the series is the drive Stevie's story forward and help her find her identity. In an interview with Last Broadcast the actress said that {{over the course of}} the series, Stevie becomes more streetwise and a better judge of character.|$|E
500|$|Toyah's image {{eventually}} {{began to}} change and she became more aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> looked when she got a boyfriend and started college. Toyah also took extra English lessons from Ken Barlow (William Roache) {{in a bid to}} better herself. Taylor later commented that her character got on her nerves due to her naivety. She also thought that Toyah had a romantic view of love, was too trusting and occasionally needed to be [...] "a bit more clued up". The actress added that Toyah was [...] "a very decent person", who was loyal to her friends. Digital Spy's Kris Green described Toyah as [...] "the more mellow of the Battersbys" [...] and thought that was due to Les (Bruce Jones) not being her biological father. The Daily Mirror's Charlie Catchpole commented that Toyah went [...] "from lumpy, sulky schoolgirl to confident, radiant young woman".|$|E
500|$|Abi's earlier storylines {{consist of}} her parents {{fighting}} for custody of her and her siblings, being injured in a collision with Deano Wicks' (Di Angelo) car and helping her friend Ben (Jones) with his abuse from stepmother Stella Crawford (Thompson) In February 2011, Abi {{was involved in a}} car accident with Max and would suffer severe injuries after their car collides with a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to her new partner Greg (Booth). The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011. After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012. She said, [...] "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one of our best actresses. What's lovely about this year is that she'll be doing her GCSEs, and then once that's out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> can get something that's a bit heavier and a bit bigger. She'll be old enough to work longer hours, so I think they'd be mad if they didn't give her something to sink her teeth into at some point this year".|$|E

500|$|In October {{she started}} the 2-5 {{favorite}} for the Zenyatta Stakes at Santa Anita. After leading for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was headed in the final furlong and beaten a neck by Stellar Wind with the pair finishing more than eleven lengths clear {{of the other three}} runners. On November 4, in what was scheduled to be her final racecourse appearance before her retirement, Beholder made her first appearance in the Breeders' Cup since 2013 when she once again contested the Distaff at Santa Anita. Stellar Wind was again challenging, but the odds-on favorite was the undefeated three-year-old Songbird. Beholder, coming off three losses, was third in the betting odds. From the outside post position of the eight-horse field, Beholder tracked the leaders before moving alongside Songbird on the final turn. The pair engaged in a prolonged struggle in the straight before Beholder prevailed by a scant nose in a photo-finish. Stevens described the race by saying, [...] "I've been in battles before, but never the length of the stretch [...] [...] [...] definitely {{a quarter of a mile}} of just a street fight." [...] With her win, she tied Goldikova as one of only two horses to have ever won three Breeders' Cup Championships in the history of the series.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Work It Out" [...] is a moderately paced R, soul, and funk song. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it has a moderately slow tempo of 84 beats per minute and incorporates elements of post-disco. The song has been viewed as reminiscent of 1960s and 1970s funk and soul music, with Craig Seymour of Entertainment Weekly describing the tune as a [...] "retro-thumper". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME commented that the song features [...] "super-heavy funk", and is [...] "an absolutely faultless attempt to re-create on classics by The J.B.'s and Lynn Anderson", while Nick Duerden of Spin magazine described the song as a [...] "stunning '60s soul vamp." [...] Duerden and John Mulvey of New Musical Express recognized that The Netunes paid tribute to James Brown within the song. While making {{a reference to the}} fact that the song contains various elements of 1960s and 1970s musical styles, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated that [...] "Work It Out" [...] positioned Beyoncé as [...] "an MTV generation Tina Turner". Spin echoed Cinquemani's sentiments by describing Beyoncé as [...] "gritty and sultry", referencing Tina Turner. Beyoncé has additionally been described as [...] "a 'Rock Steady'-era Aretha Franklin" [...] because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> [...] "ambitiously grunts, wails, and moans" [...] on [...] "Work It Out".|$|E
2500|$|Interactive {{fiction writer}} Emily Short was {{generally}} {{pleased with the}} experimental gameplay of Heavy Rain, but found the game's story {{to be full of}} [...] "stock bits" [...] borrowed from films, leaving inconsistent characterisation and gaps and poor pacing in its plot. She cited the disconnection between the motivation of the specific character and the motivation of the game's player, such as when Ethan is challenged to navigate a maze of wires charged with electricity; Ethan the character is guided to finish it regardless of ability, but the player is given the option to abandon the challenge if they cannot do it. She also considered that the characterisation does not follow the game's claim of how choices matter, pointing out that the reveal of the identity of the Origami Killer was a [...] "betrayal" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> had played the game to that point. Ian Bogost, a video game designer and Assistant Professor of Literature Communication and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, counters claims that Heavy Rain qualifies as an [...] "interactive film". Bogost notes that [...] "film is editing", in that filmmakers put together images and scenes in a compilation to evoke certain feelings and emotions, and to convey story and plot in a limited amount of time. While Heavy Rain strives for this, it retains elements of a video game, and Bogost considers the game to have a [...] "rejection of editing in favor of prolonging"; examples given are the need to have the player provide interaction for most of the characters' motion, or having to control and watch Ethan throughout his search for Jason at the crowded mall. Bogost opined that this [...] "prolonging" [...] may actually be beneficial to the video game medium, as several scenes from the game's third chapter, during which Ethan runs through a routine schedule of homework, dinner, and bedtime for Shaun, allow for periods where the game waits for the player to interact with it; during these periods, simply by using mise en scène images of the house and characters, invite the player to think about what the characters are experiencing, [...] "to linger on the mundane instead of cutting to the consequential". In 2010, the game was included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.|$|E

50|$|At first, Helaine's {{annoyance}} {{was shown}} {{at the fact that}} both Pixel and Score possessed no non-magical abilities. Later she becomes less uptight and ends up friends with the two boys. As the series progresses she shows that she may have romantic feelings for Score(Matt).
