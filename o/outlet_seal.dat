40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a rotary mechanical feeder, which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized lock hopper or paste feeder methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different outlet arrangements. The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the <b>outlet</b> <b>seal</b> at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|E

This report summarizes work undertaken {{in the first quarter}} of 2000 in support of that objective. At the end of the last quarter the pump had been re-designed to incorporate a larger torque hub and provide a substantial increase in drive train strength to prevent recurrence of failures experienced during earlier testing. Additional modifications were incorporated to improve the performance of the disk seals by improved location and adjustability, and the outlet was modified to incorporate a method to allow rapid adjustment of the <b>outlet</b> <b>sealing</b> column length without pump disassembly and rework being required. This quarter has been largely spent in manufacture of the new parts required, and in initial assembly, alignment and pinning of the revised configuration. The assembly is now complete and the pump is ready for installation into the test rig for the final series of tests...|$|R

This report summarizes work undertaken {{in the first quarter}} of 1999 in support of that objective. Materials testers have been designed and built to assess properties relevant to performance in the Stamet pump. Testing has been carried out to evaluate these properties for materials to be pumped.

40|$|High energy-density turbomachines, {{like the}} SSME turbopumps, utilize {{labyrinth}} seals, {{also referred to}} as knife-edge seals, to control leakage flow. The pressure drop for such seals is order of magnitude higher than comparable jet engine seals. This is aggravated by the requirement of tight clearances resulting in possible unfavorable fluid-structure interaction of the seal system (seal flutter). To demonstrate these characteristics, a benchmark case of a High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP) <b>outlet</b> Labyrinth <b>seal</b> was studied in detail. First, an analytical assessment of the seal stability was conducted using a Pratt & Whitney legacy seal flutter code. Sensitivity parameters including pressure drop, rotor-to-stator running clearances and cavity volumes were examined and modeling strategies established. Second, a concurrent experimental investigation was undertaken to validate the stability of the seal at the equivalent operating conditions of the pump. Actual pump hardware was used to construct the test rig, {{also referred to as}} the (Flutter Rig). The flutter rig did not include rotational effects or temperature. However, the use of Hydrogen gas at high inlet pressure provided good representation of the critical parameters affecting flutter especially the speed of sound. The flutter code predictions showed consistent trends in good agreement with the experimental data. The rig test program produced a stability threshold empirical parameter that separated operation with and without flutter. This empirical parameter was used to establish the seal build clearances to avoid flutter while providing the required cooling flow metering. The calibrated flutter code along with the empirical flutter parameter was used to redesign the baseline seal resulting in a flutter-free robust configuration. Provisions for incorporation of mechanical damping devices were introduced in the redesigned seal to ensure added robustnes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} four types of porous ceramics for use as thermal transpiration materials in Knudsen pumps that operate at atmospheric pressure. Knudsen pumps are motionless gas pumps that utilize thermal transpiration along a channel or a set of channels; the channels must have a temperature gradient and must constrain the flow to remain within the free molecular or transitional flow regimes. Of the ceramics evaluated, a clay-based, 15 bar synthetic ceramic (15 PC) presents the most favorable properties for Knudsen pumps. For an input power of 3. 4 W, a 25 _ 25 mm 2 nine-stage Knudsen pump that uses this material provides a maximum pressure head of 12 kPa and a maximum gas flow rate of ≈ 3. 7 µL min _ 1. Reliability tests demonstrate more than 11 750 h of continuous operation without any deterioration in their gas pumping capabilities. A fitted model suggests that the temporal evolution of pressure at the <b>sealed</b> <b>outlet</b> of a Knudsen pump can be captured adequately using four parameters. These parameters correspond to various nonidealities that play dominant roles in the transient response of these pumps...|$|R
40|$|The {{leakages}} and {{the dynamic}} characteristics of six types of spiral grooved seals are experimentally investigated. The {{effect of the}} helix angle of the seal is investigated mainly under {{the condition of the}} same nominal clearances, land and groove lengths, and groove depths. The dynamic characteristics are measured for various parameters such as preswirl velocity, pressure difference between inlet and <b>outlet</b> of the <b>seal,</b> whirling amplitude, whirling speed, and rotating speed of the rotor. The results are also compared with leakage increases with the increase of the helix angle, but as the rotating speed increases, the leakages of the larger helix angle seals quickly drop. The leakage of the smooth-stator (SS) /smooth-grooved rotor (SGR) seal drops faster than that of the spiral-grooved stator (SGS) /smooth-rotor (SR) seal. It is found that a circumferential flow can be produced by the flow along the helix angle direction, and this circumferential flow acts as a negative swirl. For the present helix angle range, there is an optimum helix angle with which the seal has a comparatively positive effect on the rotor stability. Compared with the SGS/SR seals, the SS/SGR seal has a worse effect on the rotor stability...|$|R
40|$|Labyrinth seals are key {{elements}} to limit leakage flow between rotating and stationary parts of turbo machines. However, these seals can modify the rotordynamic stability of machines. Thus, accurate predictions of static and dynamic behaviour for labyrinth seals {{are very important}} to optimize efficiency and operating conditions of rotating machines using this kind of seals. The present work contributes by a numerical model based on CFD computation to predict leakage flow and rotordynamic coefficients for a short eccentric labyrinth seal with four teeth fixed on the rotor. The developed model accuracy has been validated on experimental measurements of the pressure distribution along and around the seal which drops from 110770 Pa at the seal inlet to 103300 Pa at the <b>seal</b> <b>outlet.</b> A parametric study has been conducted to show the effect of pressure ratio and inlet swirl ratio on leakage flow and rotordynamic coefficients of the seal. In this study, the outlet pressure is kept constant but the inlet/outlet pressure ratio varies from 1. 072 to 8 while three inlet swirl ratios (0, 0. 5 and 1) are considered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Oxygenation {{of blood}} and other {{physiological}} solutions are routinely required in fundamental research for both in vitro and in vivo experimentation. However, very few oxygenators with suitable priming volumes (< 2 - 3 ml) are available for surgery in small animals. We have designed a new, miniaturized membrane oxygenator and investigated the oxygen-transfer performance using both buffer and blood perfusates. METHODS The mini-oxygenator was designed with a central perforated core-tube surrounded by parallel-oriented microporous polypropylene hollow fibres, placed inside a hollow shell with a lateral-luer <b>outlet,</b> and <b>sealed</b> at both extremities. With this design, perfusate is delivered via the core-tube to {{the centre of the}} mini-oxygenator, and exits via the luer port. A series of mini-oxygenators were constructed and tested in an in vitro perfusion circuit by monitoring oxygen transfer using modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer or whole porcine blood. Effects of perfusion pressure and temperature over flows of 5 - 60 ml × min(- 1) were assessed. RESULTS Twelve mini-oxygenators with a mean priming volume of 1. 5 ± 0. 3 ml were evaluated. With buffer, oxygen transfer reached a maximum of 14. 8 ± 1. 0 ml O 2 × l(- 1) (pO 2 : 450 ± 32 mmHg) at perfusate flow rates of 5 ml × min(- 1) and decreased with an increase in perfusate flow to 7. 8 ± 0. 7 ml ml O 2 × l(- 1) (pO 2 : 219 ± 24 mmHg) at 60 ml × min(- 1). Similarly, with blood perfusate, oxygen transfer also decreased as perfusate flow increased, ranging from 33 ± 5 ml O 2 × l(- 1) at 5 ml × min(- 1) to 11 ± 2 ml O 2 × l(- 1) at 60 ml × min(- 1).

40|$|From immemorial time, dams {{have contributed}} {{significantly}} for {{the progress of}} civilizations. For this reason, nowadays, there is a vast engineering heritage. Over the years, these infrastructures can present some ordinary maintenance issues associated with their normal operation or with ageing processes. Normally, these problems do not represent an important risk for the structure, {{but they have to}} be attended. To do it, owners of dams have to finance many ordinary interventions. As it is impossible to carry out all of them at the same time, managers {{have to make a decision}} and select the most “important” ones. However, it is not easy because interventions usually have very different natures (for example: repair a bottom <b>outlet,</b> change gates, <b>seal</b> a crack [...] .) and because they cannot use a classical risk analysis for these type of interventions. Authors, who are aware this problem, present, in this paper, a multi-criteria decision-making system to prioritize these interventions with the aim of providing engineers a useful tool, with which they can order the interventions from the most important to the last. To do it, authors have used MIVES. This tool defines the Prioritization Index for the Management of Hydraulic Structures (PIMHS), which assesses, in two indivisible phases, the contribution to sustainability of each intervention. The first phase measures the damage of the dam, and the second one measures the social, environmental and economic impacts. At the end of the paper, it is presented a case of study where some interventions are evaluated with PIMHS...|$|R
40|$|Thermal transpiration-driven Knudsen pumps {{have the}} ability to pump gas {{molecules}} without the use of any moving parts. This promises high structural reliability and low frictional losses. However, the dearth of suitable transpiration materials with appropriate properties has limited their performance, especially for atmospheric pressure operation. This thesis describes the use of bulk nanoporous materials for thermal transpiration-driven gas pumping at atmospheric pressure. A naturally-occurring zeolite, clinoptilolite, is used to demonstrate the feasibility of thermal transpiration-driven Knudsen pumps using bulk nanoporous ceramics. For an input power of 5. 35 W, the initial prototype has a temperature bias of 38 K across the thickness of the zeolite disc. This results in a gas flow of ≈ 0. 12 sccm with a nominal pressure load of ≈ 50 Pa at the output, or a maximum pressure head of ≈ 1 kPa. Transient pressure response at the <b>sealed</b> <b>outlet</b> of a Knudsen pump is analyzed using a fitted model, which allows us to quantify various non-idealities. Several other synthetic nanoporous ceramics are also evaluated for their thermal transpiration-driven gas flow characteristics. A clay-based ceramic 15 PC is identified as suitable for multistage Knudsen pumps that may accommodate higher pressure heads. While operating at 55 K above room temperature, a 9 -stage Knudsen pump is demonstrated to generate a maximum pressure head ≈ 12 kPa, or a gas flow of ≈ 3. 8 µL/min. against a pressure head of 160 Pa. The pump has a footprint of ≈ 8 x 8 mm 2 /stage. To date, a multistage Knudsen pump has operated continuously for more than 7000 hours without any deterioration in its performance. Higher gas flow generation capabilities are demonstrated using thermal transpiration through nanoporous cellulose ester polymer membranes. For an input power of 1. 4 W, a single stage Knudsen pump with 11. 5 mm diameter and 105 µm thick polymer membrane has a temperature bias of 30 K across the membrane, which provides 0. 4 sccm flow against a 330 Pa pressure head. Experiments suggest that the polymer Knudsen pump results in a thermal transpiration-driven gas flow of ≈ 1 sccm in absence of any external load. It has a final packaged volume of 14 x 14 x 4. 5 mm 3. To date, a polymer pump has operated continuously for more than 600 hours without deterioration...|$|R
