5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct.

40|$|Cisplatin is an anticancer drug {{currently}} {{used in the}} treatment of genital and head and neck tumors. Its use in these and other types of tumors is narrowed by onset of chemoresistance and severe undesired side effects, like as nephro- and ototoxicity, whose mechanisms of action are only partially understood. In the present study we investigated the effects of cisplatin (cis-dichlorodiaminoplatin, CDDP) on a cell line (OC-k 3) developed from <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> <b>of</b> transgenic mice. We observed at 48 h that cell death due to cisplatin was time and concentration-dependent. The cell death displayed some morphological hallmarks of apoptosis, including nuclear fragmentation into several large nuclear fragments, surrounded by a rearranged and thickened actin cytoskeleton. No DNA laddering was detected, suggesting absence of endonuclease activity, nor annexin V positivity, suggesting absence of phosphatidylserine externalization. Several molecules protected the cells against CDDP induced cytotoxicity, including methionine, suramin and PD 98059. Methionine reduced CDDP-uptake, while suramin, a polycathionic compound a specifically binding external proteins, did not. This finding suggested that suramin could exert its protective effect by acting on an intracellular transduction pathway. We tested this hypothesis by studying the effect of suramin and PD 98059, a MEK inhibitor, on the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. After CDDP treatment, we found an increase of phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1 / 2, that could be inhibited by PD 98059 and suramin. These data suggest that ERK pathways can play a role in mediating the cell death induction in presence of a CDDP challenge. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{high-level}} noise {{leads to}} oxidative stress and triggers apoptosis {{of the hair}} cells. This study examined whether p 53, a tumor suppressor protein, is activated in the cochlea following impulse noise exposure. Inhibition of p 53 with pifithrin alpha, a specific p 53 inhibitor, or KX 1 - 004, a Src-protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was tested to determine if p 53 inhibition could reduce noise-induced hearing loss and cochlear damage. Chinchillas were pre-treated with a local administration of pifithrin alpha or KX 1 - 004 and exposed to impulse noise. The chinchillas were assessed for threshold shift at 1 and 24 h after the noise. At 4 or 24 h post noise, the cochleae were removed and <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> were examined to assess {{the damage to the}} cells and upregulation of p 53 by the noise. Apoptosis was evident in both outer hair cells and supporting cells. Phospho-p 53 (Ser 15) was upregulated 4 h and 24 h after the noise. KX 1 - 004 and pifithrin alpha both decreased threshold shift and the number of missing outer hair cells. These results indicate that p 53 is involved {{in the early stages of}} noise-induced cell death and inhibition of this signaling pathway is a potential protective strategy against noise-induced hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{over the last}} few years demonstrated that signaling pathways that operate in the <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> (OC) play a central role in survival and death of hair cells. An important goal of molecular otology is to characterize these signaling pathways in normal inner ears and inner ears exposed to a variety of different forms of stress, such as ototoxic substances and noise overexposure. In this study, we used high-performance reverse protein microarray technology and phospho-specific antibodies to examine the activation status of defined molecules involved in cellular signaling. We demonstrate that reverse protein microarrays based on the highly sensitive planar-waveguide technology provide an effective and high-throughput means to assess the activation state of key molecules involved in apoptotic and prosurvival signaling in microdissected OC explants over time. In this study, we show that gentamicin and a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor increase the ratio of phospho-c-Jun/c-Jun in OC explants of postnatal rats soon after exposure to these drugs. In addition, we found a decrease in the phospho-Akt/Akt ratio in OC explants early after NF-kappaB inhibition. Finally, we observed an early and consistent decrease in the phospho-p 38 /p 38 ratio in OC explants exposed to the NF-kappaB inhibitor and only a transient decrease in this ratio in OC examples after gentamicin exposure...|$|R

40|$|TRPML 3 (mucolipin- 3) {{belongs to}} one of the transient-receptor-potential (TRP) ion channel families. Mutations in the Trpml 3 gene cause {{disorganization}} of the stereociliary hair bundle, structural aberrations in outer and inner hair cells and stria vascularis defects, leading to deafness in the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse. Here we refined the stereociliary localization of TRPML 3 and investigated cochlear hair cell function in varitint-waddler (Va(J)) mice carrying the TRPML 3 mutations. Using a TRPML 3 -specific antibody we detected a similar to 68 kDa protein with near-equal expression levels in cochlea and vestibule of wild-type and Va(J) mutants. At postnatal days 3 and 5, we observed abundant localization of TRPML 3 at the base of stereocilia near the position of the ankle links. This stereociliary localization domain was absent in Va(J) heterozygotes and homozygotes. Electrophysiological recordings revealed reduced mechano-electrical transducer currents in hair cells from Va(J) /+ and Va(J) /Va(J) mice. Furthermore, FM 1 - 43 uptake and [H- 3]gentamicin accumulation were decreased in hair cells in cultured <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> from Va(J) /+ and Va(J) /Va(J) mice. We propose that TRPML 3 plays a critical role at the ankle-link region during hair-bundle growth and that an adverse effect of mutant TRPML 3 on bundle development and mechano-electrical transduction is the main cause of hearing loss in Va(J) /+ mutant mice. Outer hair cells of Va(J) /Va(J) mice additionally had depolarized resting potentials due to an inwardly rectifying leak conductance formed by the mutant channels, leading over time to hair-cell degeneration and contributing to their deafness. Our findings argue against TRPML 3 being a component of the hair-cell transducer channel...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Aims: Estrogens have a {{positive}} impact on the auditory function. Indeed, estradiol (E 2) treatment in animals protects against acoustic trauma and aminoglycoside toxicity and its depletion can contribute to age-related hearing loss. However, estradiol is not suitable in clinical practice, given the increased risk of cancer and thromboembolic events. There is a need to find new treatments that present a higher benefit/risk ratio. In this work, we studied a new natural estrogen derivative, estetrol (E 4), that was shown to act as a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM). Estetrol is thus able to display estrogen-like as well as antiestrogen activity depending on the target tissue. Interestingly, E 4 allows the prevention of menopause symptoms such as osteoporosis or hot flushes through an agonistic action, whereas it exerts anti-estrogenic effects on the mammary gland. These preclinical data suggest that E 4 presents a safer profile than E 2. Material and Methods: To investigate whether this molecule presents otoprotective actions, we exposed P 2 cultured <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> to gentamicin, with or without estetrol (E 4). After 48 hours of culture, hair cell survival was evaluated following anti-myosin VII Immunohistochemistry. We next moved on to in vivo studies using young zebrafish larvae (5 dpf), since they constitute a highly effective model to determine the potential ototoxicity of drugs and to screen for candidates of hair cell protective agents. We monitored the survival of hair cells within neuromasts following chronic or acute exposure to gentamicin. Results: In cochlear culture, gentamicin-induced hair cell loss was significantly reduced by E 4. Interestingly, the toxicity of aminoglycoside was also reduced in vivo upon treatment of zebrafish larvae with E 4. Conclusion: The survival rate of hair cells was increased in the presence of estetrol both in vitro and in vivo indicating that estetrol constitutes an interesting protective drug against hearing loss.

40|$|Unlike lower vertebrates, {{capable of}} {{spontaneous}} hair cell regeneration, mammals experience permanent {{sensorineural hearing loss}} following hair cell damage. Although low levels of hair cell regeneration have been demonstrated in the immature mammalian vestibular system, the cochlea has been thought to lack any spontaneous regenerative potential. Inhibition of the Notch pathway can stimulate hair cell generation in neonatal mammals, but the specific source of these new hair cells has been unclear. Here, using in vitro lineage tracing with the supporting cell markers Sox 2 and Lgr 5, we show that Lgr 5 -positive inner pillar and 3 rd Deiter's cells in gentamicin-damaged <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> from neonatal mice give rise to new hair cells following treatment with a Notch inhibitor. These new hair cells are generated primarily through direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells, although a small number show evidence of proliferation. Inner pillar cells show the greatest transdifferentation capability, giving rise to immature outer hair cells, and transdifferentiating in response to damage {{even in the absence}} of Notch inhibition. In vivo pharmacologic inhibition of Notch and in vivo lineage tracing with Sox 2 during genetic Notch inhibition provide generally consistent results, although additional new hair cells develop in the inner hair cell region. These data suggest a spontaneous capacity for hair cell regeneration in the neonatal mammalian cochlea. In addition, the data identify Lgr 5 -positive supporting cells as potential hair cell progenitors, making them an attractive target for future hair cell regeneration treatments. by Naomi F.

40|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} large-conductance Ca 2 +- and voltage-activated K+ channels (BKCa) is their allosteric activation by two distinct stimuli, membrane depolarization and cytosolic Ca 2 + ions. In this allosteric gating, increasing cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) shifts the depolarization required for channel opening into the physiological voltage range. In fact, according to present knowledge, elevation of [Ca 2 +]i to micromolar levels is the only means to activate BKCa at membrane potentials below 0 mV. We recorded BKCa-mediated currents from auditory inner hair cells (IHCs) in acutely isolated <b>organs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corti</b> using the patch-clamp technique in whole-cell and excised patch configuration. In inside-out and outside-out patches, activation of BKCa channels from IHCs showed the prototypic sensitivity to increased [Ca 2 +]i. However, channel activation at 0 [Ca 2 +]i occurred at unusually negative potentials (half-maximal activation (Vh) around 0 mV), indicating that a large fraction of the channels can be activated at physiological voltages without elevated [Ca 2 +]i. In intact IHCs, the activation curve of BKCa currents recorded in whole-cell configuration exhibited a Vh of − 42 mV together with a high voltage dependence (slope factor of 10 mV) and submillisecond onset of current. Surprisingly, this activation was independent of changes in local [Ca 2 +]i as shown by experiments that interfered with Ca 2 + influx through voltage-gated Ca 2 + (Cav) channels, release of Ca 2 + from internal stores, or intracellular buffer capacity. This behaviour is not due to β-subunits of BKCa (BKβ), as genetic inactivation of the β-subunit expressed in IHCs, KCNMB 1, did not affect BKCa gating. We conclude that the BKCa channel protein in IHCs may be modified in order to rapidly activate and deactivate at resting [Ca 2 +]i. Our results suggest that BKCa may function as a purely voltage-gated K+ channel with exceptionally rapid activation kinetics, challenging the view that both increased cytosolic Ca 2 + and depolarization are generally required for activation of BKCa...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} people who suffer from the hearing impediments, which caused by many reasons such as age, cancer, tuberculosis, noise, drug abuse, {{physical}} trauma worldwide [1 – 4]. As one of most serious and typical hearing impairment, sensorineural hearing loss is often caused by the damage or loss of hair cells <b>of</b> the <b>organ</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Corti</b> in the cochlea, which leads to the disorder of frequency discrimination of the hearing function [5 – 7]. The most important functions of cochlea are separating the incoming sound waves by their frequencies and convert different frequency of sound-induced vibration into electricity to stimulate auditory nerves [8, 9]. The basilar membrane which is a special film plays a significance role for the frequencies selectivity. Most of patients who suffer from the sensorineural hearing loss choose to cochlea implants, which transform the acoustic into electricity to stimulate auditory nerves through an electric array inserted in the cochlea [10, 11]. However, these cochlea implants make the patients feel very uncomfortable for they have many additional equipment located on the patients’ head, which result in many inconveniences when the patients sleep or excise. On the other hand, they also need peripheral devices to provide electric energy for all the system [12]. To overcome those disadvantages, fabricating a self-powered article and fully self-contained implantable artificial cochlea has been focus of efforts by many researchers globally.|$|R

During the postnatal maturation, a CR-immunostaining appeared around the IHC body and CR was expressed transiently in the OHC. In the adult-like dog cochlea, a CR-positive network surrounded the unlabeled IHC. The neuronal CR-labeling remained unchanged from birth. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated.
