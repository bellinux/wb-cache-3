Materials and methods. The study involved 200 patients with OB in conjunction with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and BT pathology, {{who at the time}} of sonographic and morphological study of liver biopsy revealed signs of hepatic steatosis. Depending on the degree of increase in BMI of all patients with OB and NAHS (n= 100) and NASH (n= 100) were divided into three groups: 1 group – EBM; 2 group – OB I degree; 3 group – <b>OB</b> <b>II</b> degree. The control group consisted of 20 practically healthy persons (PHP). Indicators of EI were determined by the content of middle weight molecules (MWM), their fractional composition: MWM-λ- 210, MWM-λ- 254, MWM-λ- 280, concentration of copper (Cu) in serum of blood. Results. The content of MWM, MWM-λ- 210, MWM-λ- 254, MWM-λ- 280, and Cu in the serum of patients with the EBM and OB in combination with NAHS and NASH were significantly increased relative to PHP in the presence of EBM and OB I degree (from p< 0. 05 to p< 0. 001), with higher values of EI indicators in patients with <b>OB</b> <b>II</b> degree.

40|$|The {{quality of}} plastic films used for {{horizontal}} silos {{is important to}} limit losses in the upper silage layer. The aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of different plastic films in reducing the top losses in maize silage. The following treatments were evaluated: (i) coextruded polyethylene/polyamide oxygen barrier film (<b>OB),</b> (<b>ii)</b> polyethylene film (PE), (iii) polyvinyl chloride film (PVC), and (iv) coextruded PE/polyvinyl alcohol film (PVOH). These treatments differed according to oxygen permeability with values of 75, 722, 982 and 289 cm(3) m(- 2) per 24 hour respectively. OB and PVOH films had better temperature and fermentation profiles than the more permeable films. The OB film was effective in reducing the dry-matter (DM) losses during storage (82 g kg(- 1)), and the PVOH film had an intermediate value of DM loss (101 g kg(- 1)). PE and PVC films had higher losses (138 and 145 g kg(- 1) respectively). Oxygen permeability of the films promoted a positive correlation with DM losses (P < 0. 05; r 2 = 0. 945). The results indicate that O 2 permeability through the plastic film is a crucial factor for maintaining silage quality in the upper layer of the silo when it is perfectly sealed.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how an {{existing}} empirical drought index, i. e. the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) that {{is commonly used}} for assessing forest fire danger, has been adjusted and modified for improved use in tropical wetland ecosystems. The improvement included: (i) adjustment of the drought factor to the local climate, and (ii) addition of the water table depth as a dynamic factor to control the drought index. We distinguished three different indices, the original Keetch-Byram Drought Index, the adjusted KBDI (KBDI adj) that represents the original drought index, but including local climate information, and the modified KBDI (mKBDI) that considers both local climate information, and soil and hydrological characteristics. The mKBDI was developed and tested in a wetland forest of South Sumatra (Indonesia) from April 2009 to March 2011. During this period, hydrometeorological data were monitored and {{used to calculate the}} KBDI, KBDI adj, and mKBDI. First, mKBDI was calibrated using observed soil moisture that was converted to an observed drought index (DI obs). The results indicate that performance of the mKBDI is encouraging based on the following: (i) its pattern followed the dynamics of DI <b>obs,</b> (<b>ii)</b> prediction of frequency of fire danger classes, and (iii) statistically criteria. The mKBDI clearly outperformed KBDI and KBDI adj. Furthermore, we found a critical water table depth when it reaches maximum fire danger (0. 85 m for the wetland forest of South Sumatra) below which danger does not increase anymore. The mKBDI could be more widely applied, if pedotransfer functions are developed that link easily obtainable soil properties to the parameters of the water table factor. Our findings encourage land use planners, water managers and stakeholders (e. g. forest estate owners) to integrate local climate information, and soil and hydrological characteristics into the Keetch-Byram Drought Index to better predict fire danger, particularly in tropical wetland ecosystems. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} Galactic properties {{within the}} most massive gas phases of the ISM are derived along with the distribution of total Galactic FIR luminosity among the three phases. Most of the Galaxy's total FIR luminosity {{is found to be}} emitted by cold dust associated with diffuse H I clouds and molecular gas. The total FIR luminosity of dust associated with extended low-density H II regions accounts for less than 10 percent of the Galaxy's total FIR output. The absence of a significant variation with longitude in the observed temperature of the dust associated with H I gas suggests that diffuse neutral clouds contain very small dust grains that are stochastically heated by the interstellar radiation field. The results are consistent with a model in which most of the FIR luminosity of molecular clouds arises from dust that is associated with giant molecular clouds and heated by embedded and nearby <b>OB</b> stars. H <b>II</b> regions in the inner Galaxy have a mean IR excess ratio of about 2. 5, suggesting that the dust in these regions is heated primarily by directly absorbed stellar photons...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop an {{observation}} program for obtaining effective flat images that are necessary for photometric observation. The development of the program was achieved by improving the existing method for obtaining twilight flat images. The existing method for obtaining twilight flat images acquires flat images by observing the sky light after sunset or light before sunrise. The decision of when to observe flat images at each night is solely dependent on the judgment of an observer, and thus the obtained flat images for particular nights may not be clean. Especially, in the case of the observatories where an automated observation system is in operation, there is a difficulty that an observer should pay attention during sunrise and sunset in order to obtain flat images. In this study, a computer program is developed to improve this inconvenience and to efficiently perform photometric observation in the observatories where an automated observation system is applied. This program can obtain flat images by calculating the time for obtaining flat images automatically and the exposure time using a numerically calculated function. When obtaining twilight flat images at dusk and at dawn, the developed program performs automated observation and provides effective flat images by acquiring appropriate exposure time considering the sunrise and sunset times that vary depending on the day of observation. The code for performing this task was added to <b>Obs</b> Tool <b>II</b> (Yoon et al. 2006), which is the automated observation system of the Chungbuk National University Observatory, and the usefulness of the developed program was examined by performing an actual automated observation. If this program is applied to other observatories where automated observation is in operation, it is expected that stable and highquality flat images could be obtained, which can be used for the pre-processing of photometric observation data...|$|R

Using Hα data and BV photometry of the blue stars in this dIrr galaxy, we investigate the distribution of OB stars and H II regions and determine whether individual areas of the galaxy are separately and/or collectively in a state of ionization balance. Four distinct components of the Hα emission (bright, halo, diffuse and field) differentiated by their surface brightnesses are identified. We find that approximately 1 / 2 of all OB stars in NGC 6822 are located in the field while only 1 / 4 are found in the combined bright and halo regions, suggesting that OB stars spend roughly 3 / 4 of their lifetimes outside “classical ” H <b>II</b> regions. If <b>OB</b> stars escape from bright H II regions by destroying their parent molecular clouds, then cloud lifetimes after forming OB stars could be as low as ∼ 1 - 3 × 10 6 yrs or 1 / 4 the typical main sequence lifetimes of OB stars.

40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} spatial distribution of the thermal far-infrared and non-thermal radio emission of nearby spiral galaxies. This is done {{in an attempt to}} improve our understanding of the well known correlation between the integrated Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) far-infrared and radio emission of spiral galaxies, e. g., de Jong et al., 1985, Helou et al., 1986. A physical explanation for this correlation is not straight forward due to the ambiguous nature of the origin of the far-infrared and radio, and the dependence of the non-thermal radio on each galaxies' magnetic field. It is now widely believed that the infrared emission detected in the longer wavelength IRAS wavebands (less than 50 microns) arises from at least two distinct sources, e. g., Cox et al., 1986, Persson and Helou, 1987 : (1) a warm (T approx. 40 K) component associated with dense dust clouds heated by embedded O and B type stars; and (2) a cooler (T approx. 20 K) component associated with diffuse dust distributed throughout the interstellar matter (ISM) heated by the interstellar radiation field. A link between the warm component and the radio via electrons originating in Type II supernovae (the ultimate fate of many of the O and B type stars responsible for the warm component) has been suggested by numerous authors. The supporting evidence is scarce and inconclusive. Researchers have attempted to provide some insight into the problem by looking at the spatial distribution of the different components in some nearby spiral galaxies, starting with the face-on spiral M 51. The source of the far-infrared data is the IRAS chopped photometric channel (CPC) instrument. Warm and cold far-infrared fluxes integrated over all wavelengths and the radio intensity at two frequencies are plotted against radius. All plots are to a common resolution of 100 arcsec, the radio data originating from the Cambridge Low Frequency Synthesis Telescope (151 MHz) and the VLA (1490 MHz, from Condon, 1987). The warm and cold regions are assumed to be representedby a single galactic wide temperatures of 50 K and 20 K respectively. A dust emissivity of 1 has been assumed. The form of the plots is little effected by varying these assumptions. The radio and cold component curves appear to follow each other most closely, in contradiction to the simple <b>OB</b> star/type <b>II</b> supernovae hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Neuere Studien haben gezeigt, dass unser Gehirn bei der motorischen Kontrolle der eigenen Bewegungen auf sog. „interne Modelle“ (= ZNS-interne Repräsentationssysteme, die die kausale Beziehung zwischen Handlungen und ihren Konsequenzen simulieren) zurückgreift und insbesondere das Cerebellum ihrer Repräsentation und Optimierung unterliegt. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige Erkenntnisse darüber, wie wir die Wahrnehmung unserer eigenen Bewegungen verarbeiten. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, (i) ob wir auch hierbei auf interne Modelle der sensorischen Konsequenzen unserer eigenen Bewegungen zurückgreifen und (<b>ii)</b> <b>ob</b> die Optimierung dieser perzeptuellen Modelle ebenfalls eine wesentliche Aufgabe des Cerebellums ist. Als exemplarisches Untersuchungsmodell für die psychophysischen Messungen diente dabei die simultane Untersuchung von Wahrnehmung und Durchführung der eigenen Handbewegungen. Hier gelang uns der psychophysische Nachweis, dass das perzeptuelle Bewusstsein der eigenen Handbewegungen auf einem inferentiellen Prozess aus Abgleich zwischen interner sensorischer Vorhersage und sensorischer Bewegungsrückmeldung beruht. Diese interne sensorische Vorhersage kann sich bei kontinuierlich veränderten visuellen Bewegungsrückmeldungen anpassen, um so dem Wahrnehmungssystem auch dann eine akkurate Vorhersage zu liefern, wenn dieses nicht auf externe Bewegungsrückmeldung zurückgreifen kann. Zudem wird die angepasste interne sensorische Vorhersage vom Gehirn auch dazu verwendet, interne motorische Bewegungspläne anzupassen (Publikation Journal of Neurophysiology). Diese Funktionen interner Modelle der Wahrnehmung sind bei Patienten mit Kleinhirnschädigungen gestört: Bei fehlender visueller Rückmeldung können sie weder auf eine optimierte interne Vorhersage für die Wahrnehmung zurückgreifen noch eine solche zur Anpassung der internen motorische Planung gebrauchen. Die gegenwärtige Denkweise, dass experimentelle nachgewiesene motorischen Defizite bei Kleinhirnpatienten Folge eines primären Defizits in der motorischen Kontrolle sind, könnte sich also als zu einfach erweisen, insofern diese zumindest teilweise auf Defiziten im perzeptuellen Lernen beruhen könnten. Damit verändert sich die Sichtweise des Kleinhirns: Möglicherweise dient es nicht vorrangig der Planung und Koordination motorischer Funktionen per se, sondern primär der Erstellung und Optimierung interner Vorhersagen, welche sekundär für Wahrnehmung und Kontrolle von Eigenbewegungen gebraucht werden können (Publikation Current Biology). Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the brain resorts to so-called “internal models” (internal representations of the central nervous system which simulate the causal relationships between actions and their consequences) for motor control and that in particular cerebellar loops are part of these representations and their updating. However, only few studies have focused on the question how the we perceive our own actions. This work investigates (i) whether the perception of one’s own actions also resorts to internal models of the sensory consequences of ones actions and (ii) whether updating of these perceptual models relies on cerebellar functioning. This is exermplarily examined by simultaneously recording both action perception and action execution. We were able to show that the perceptual awareness of one’s own action builds on an inferential process of comparing internal sensory predictions and acutal sensory feedback of ones actions. These internal predictions can be recalibrated by constantly modified visual feedback, thus allowing an exact perceptual anticipation even in case of missing external action feedback. Moreover, the brain uses such a recalibrated sensory prediction to adapt internal motor programms for action execution (publication in The Journal of Neurophysiology). These functions of internal models are impaired in patients with cerebellar damage: In case of missing visual feedback they are unable to resort to a recalibrated internal prediction for perceiving one’s own movements and, moreover, to use it for adapting internal motor programs. The current view holding that motor deficits in cerebellar patients are primary a consequence of impaired motor control might be too simple in that impaired motor control might again result from impaired perceptual learning. Thus, the perspective on the functional role of the cerebellum might need to changed: The cerebellum does not seem to primarily serve motor planning and coordination per se, but to issue and recalibrate internal predictions, which can then be used for both perception and control of ones own movements (publication in Current Biology) ...|$|R
