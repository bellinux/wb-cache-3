5|$|In the post-War years, translucent, molded plastic, electrified, lit-from-within tree toppers in {{the shape}} <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> and stars became popular. Although Santa Claus and other Christmas icons were {{introduced}} as electrified toppers, the star and the angel of the Victorian era remained the preferred motif. Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.|$|E
5|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also linked Isaac's blindness in old age, {{as stated}} in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> present {{at the time of his}} sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.|$|E

5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions <b>of</b> <b>angels,</b> spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the opening}} and ending credits {{sequences}} incorporate shots of St Michael and All Angels Church in Hughenden Valley, Buckinghamshire, which doubles as the parish church of Father Unwin. In the opening sequence, a zoom shot establishes a backdrop of fields while the series title slowly fills the screen, in a motion that draws inspiration from traditional images <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> descending from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping <b>of</b> <b>angels,</b> those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E
5|$|NY273 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with US4 {{east of the}} village of Whitehall {{in the town of}} Whitehall. After the intersection, the route passed the Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Angels</b> Cemetery, where it turned to the southeast. NY273 ran along the base of Ore Red Hill, outside of Whitehall. Near Ore Red Hill, the highway intersected with a local road, which connected to US4. The route progressed to the southeast, entering the hamlet of East Whitehall, where it intersected with another local road.|$|E

5|$|The abbey is a Grade I listed building, {{particularly}} {{noted for}} its fan vaulting. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, {{in the form of}} wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> climbing to heaven on two stone ladders.|$|E
5|$|The dish is {{typically}} prepared by rolling shucked oysters in bacon and baking {{them in an}} oven. Modern variations <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> on horseback include skewering and frying. Serving can vary widely to taste on either skewers or breads, with additional accompaniments or condiments. Angels on horseback differ from the similar, fruit-based, devils on horseback, but the dishes' names are sometimes erroneously considered synonyms.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of progress {{is embedded in}} the mediaeval great chain of being, with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in Aristotle's biology, from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in Ramon Lull's Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind, 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> reaching up to God at the top.|$|E
5000|$|Possibly Uriel's highest {{position}} is that <b>of</b> an <b>Angel</b> <b>of</b> Presence, Prince <b>of</b> Presence, <b>Angel</b> <b>of</b> the Face, <b>Angel</b> <b>of</b> Sanctification, <b>Angel</b> <b>of</b> Glory. A Prince of the Presence is an angel who is allowed to enter the presence of God. Uriel along with Suriel, Jehoel, Zagagel, Akatriel, Metatron, Yefefiah, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Nathanel (Zathael) holds this position. The <b>Angel</b> <b>of</b> His Presence title is often taken to mean Shekinah but it and the other terms mentioned are also often used as alternate names for the angel Metatron. R. H. Charles comments in his translation of The Book of Enoch that in later Judaism [...] "we find Uriel instead of Phanuel" [...] as one <b>of</b> the four <b>angels</b> <b>of</b> the presence.|$|R

5|$|The west front, {{which was}} {{originally}} constructed in 1520, {{has a large}} arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503 this is a direct reference to {{the dream of the}} prophet Jacob mentioned in the Bible and commonly called Jacobs Ladder.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{during his}} first Opening Day start with the Red Sox, Beckett struck out 10 through seven innings {{allowing}} only one run and two hits in a 5–3 victory over the Rays. On April 14, 2009, MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally throwing over the head <b>of</b> <b>Angels</b> outfielder Bobby Abreu. Beckett later appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games. On June 20, 2009, he recorded his first complete game shutout in three years against the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe. The shutout was his first in a Red Sox uniform. On July 5, 2009, he was selected to represent Boston in the 2009 MLB All Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northwest}} corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E

5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{elephants}} {{being used as}} straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees {{in connection with the}} Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention <b>of</b> <b>angels,</b> following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.|$|E
5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the sustenance of the body, {{so that we may}} use it thankfully; {{at the same time we}} beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food <b>of</b> <b>angels,</b> the true bread of heaven, the eternal word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence <b>of</b> <b>angels</b> and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E
