5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected {{some aspects}} of van Eyckian realism, notably in his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E

5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> {{the electorate}} again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement. The newspaper's expectation was that Sewell should publicly state what his policies were, and not just rely on his past representation in Parliament. On 7 January 1860, Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times, inviting electors to {{a meeting at the}} Mechanics' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday, 13 January.|$|E
5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions {{from rural areas}} were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are {{mentioned in}} inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.|$|E
5|$|The post {{was created}} by the Treaty of Lisbon and was subject to a debate over its exact role. Prior to Lisbon, the Presidency rotated in {{accordance}} with the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The role of that President-in-Office was in no sense (other than protocol) equivalent to an office of a head of state, merely a primus inter pares (first among equals) role among other European heads of government. The President-in-Office was primarily responsible for preparing and chairing the Council meetings, and had no executive powers other than the task <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> the Union externally. Now the leader of the Council Presidency country can still act as president when the permanent president is absent.|$|E

5|$|Venezuelan law {{specifies}} that municipal {{governments have}} four main functions: executive, legislative, comptroller, and planning. The executive function is {{managed by the}} mayor, {{who is in charge}} <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> the municipality's administration. The legislative branch is represented by the Municipal Council, composed of seven councillors, charged with the deliberation of new decrees and local laws. The comptroller tasks are managed by the municipal comptroller's office, which oversees accountancy. Finally, planning is represented by the Local Public Planning Council, which manages development projects for the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition <b>of</b> <b>representing</b> nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, {{but their}} borders changed in some instances, {{with the latest}} revision taking place in 2006. Slavonia consists of five counties—Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Srijem counties—which largely cover the territory historically associated with Slavonia. The western borders of the five-county territory lie {{in the area where}} the western boundary of Slavonia generally has been located since the Ottoman conquest, with the remaining borders being at the international borders of Croatia. This places the Croatian part of Baranya into the Slavonian counties, constituting the Eastern Croatia macroregion. Terms Eastern Croatia and Slavonia are increasingly used as synonyms. The Brod-Posavina County comprises two cities—Slavonski Brod and Nova Gradiška—and 26Municipalities of Croatia. The Osijek-Baranja County consists of seven cities—Beli Manastir, Belišće, Donji Miholjac, Đakovo, Našice, Osijek and Valpovo—and 35municipalities. The Požega-Slavonia County comprises five cities—Kutjevo, Lipik, Pakrac, Pleternica and Požega—and five municipalities. The Virovitica-Podravina County covers three cities—Orahovica, Slatina and Virovitica—and 13municipalities. The Vukovar-Srijem County encompasses five cities—Ilok, Otok, Vinkovci, Vukovar and Županja—and 26municipalities. The whole of Slavonia is the eastern half of Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia NUTS-2 statistical unit of Croatia, together with further areas of Central Croatia. Other statistical units correspond to the counties, cities and municipalities. The five counties combined cover area size <b>of</b> , <b>representing</b> 22.2% of territory of Croatia.|$|E
30|$|In {{the next}} step of {{interpreting}} the seen (Representamen), the focus moves to the Interpretant or Sense vehicle. Interpretant further branches the analytical reasoning into Denotation and Connotation <b>of</b> <b>represented</b> elements and <b>of</b> <b>represented</b> composition, adapted from, but not neatly aligned with, Roland Barthes (1973, 1977) and Peirce’s notion of “dicent” (Nöth, 2014, b). When nouns (a woman, a laptop) are paired with verbal information (a woman {{is sitting on a}} chair) in {{the next step}} of coding interpretation (Interpretant), this “pairing” provides a descriptive information.|$|R

40|$|Represented spaces {{form the}} general {{setting for the}} study of computability derived from Turing machines. As such, they are the basic {{entities}} for endeavors such as computable analysis or computable measure theory. The theory <b>of</b> <b>represented</b> spaces is well-known to exhibit a strong topological flavour. We present an abstract and very succinct introduction to the field; drawing heavily on prior work by Escardó, Schröder, and others. Central aspects of the theory are function spaces and various spaces of subsets derived from other represented spaces, and [...] closely linked to these [...] properties <b>of</b> <b>represented</b> spaces such as compactness, overtness and separation principles. Both the derived spaces and the properties are introduced by demanding the computability of certain mappings, and it is demonstrated that typically various interesting mappings induce the same property.
