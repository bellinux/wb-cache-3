5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> than the House of Lords. Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E

In most appeals, the Supreme Court of Missouri may, and often does, reject an appeal from the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> (called [...] "discretionary jurisdiction"). Historically, less than ten percent <b>of</b> the <b>appeals</b> heard by the Missouri Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> are {{transferred}} to the Supreme Court.

50|$|The Ohio District Courts <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> are the {{intermediate}} appellate courts {{of the state}} of Ohio. The Ohio Constitution provides for courts <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> that have jurisdiction to review final appealable orders. There are twelve appellate districts in the U.S. state of Ohio. Each court <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> consists <b>of</b> at least one county, and the number of judges in each district varies from four to twelve. Each case is heard by a three-judge panel. There are currently 69 courts <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> judges as provided by statute. A court <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> judge is an elected position, with a term of six years. The Ohio Supreme Court has the discretion to review cases from the courts <b>of</b> <b>appeals,</b> but generally the appeals process in Ohio ends with the decision of the court <b>of</b> <b>appeals.</b>|$|R

The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E
