500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

6000|$|It must {{be allowed}} that {{the light of the}} moon, {{sufficient}} though it is for the pensive walker, and not disproportionate to the inner light we have, is very inferior in quality and intensity to that of the sun. But the moon is not to be judged alone by the quantity of light she sends to us, but also by her influence on the earth and its inhabitants. [...] "The moon gravitates toward the earth, and the earth reciprocally toward the moon." [...] The poet who walks by moonlight is conscious of a tide in his thought which is to be referred to lunar influence.

Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while [...] "many critics like to think... Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as [...] "surely just wishful thinking".

We really weren’t thinking that. We had no idea that we were creating a new movement.

He picked [...] "Unforgiven", [...] "Frankenstein + the Bride", [...] "Fantasyland", and [...] "The Last Dance" [...] as the album's highlights. Davey Boy from Sputnik Music gave the album a 1.4 (very poor) out of 5, saying [...] "Sure, {{there has been some}} gradual growth since their horrid initial output, but improving on Shakespearian lyrics such as “I’ll throw a dildo in your grave, party up and start a rave” and “My cum’s so chunky, it’s like an Oreo McFlurry” really isn’t all that difficult."

5000|$|Rooty {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. John Bush of AllMusic gave it 5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "so raw you can't believe they spent over an hour per track, so perfect you're glad they stopped noodling about long before most producers would, and so poppy they should get picked up by commercial radio in America {{as well as the}} rest of the world". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave it an A- grade and called the album [...] "where heart and feet meet and lovingly coexist". Robert Christgau of Village Voice gave it the same grade, writing [...] "no catchier collection of jingles has come to my attention since Steve Miller made his mint off jet airliners". Billboard said the album [...] "revels in exploiting rhythms that shouldn't work—but definitely do".

40|$|Expert {{power is}} gained through knowledge, expertise, or experi-ence (Marquis and Huston, 2009). Student nurses build expert {{power as a}} result of {{cumulative}} clinical experience, as well as work experi-ence gained outside of school. The more clinical experience you have, the greater your self confidence and skill level will be. In addition, both students and new nurses can increase their expert power by earn-ing specialty certifications, such as pediatric and adult advanced life support, pressure monitoring, and EKG interpretation. These skills increase your job marketability and provide additional tools to use in caring for patients. New nurses should also plan to ad-vance their education, whether this is to earn a bachelor’s, a master’s, or a doctoral degree, depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> entry into the profession. Higher education always increases your power base {{as a result of}} the new knowledge you’ve gained. Mentors and Positive Role Models Positive role models are contagious as are negative role models. If you associate primarily with disgruntled, complaining individuals, it is likely that your behavior will reflect theirs. Identify positive role models of nursing excellence and emulate their behavior. Colleagues who enjoy their work and are committed to life-long learning will likely be recognized as positive role models and professional nurse who make a difference in the patient care. Mentors, however, are even more important than role models in building a personal power base since mentoring is more active...|$|R

Hence, {{much more so than}} the 1965 film (which was entirely a spoof of the James Bond movies), the 1966 sequel essentially re-invents Dr Goldfoot as a spoof of Peter Sellers' character, Dr Strangelove, in place of Ian Fleming's Dr No.|$|E
50|$|GAN/UMA is not {{the first}} system to allow the use of {{unlicensed}} spectrum to connect handsets to a GSM network.

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> political <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|R
30|$|For the {{instructor}} Paula, the students’ voices were {{central to the}} research paper, which she described as an “academic conversation,” noting that {{what they were doing}} is “reading what's been said and you're entering the conversation and putting <b>your</b> stamp <b>on</b> it. <b>Your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view…your opinion is a reasoned one, an educated one…” (Observation, 1 / 31 / 13). While {{it is not clear what}} {{the instructor}} thought of Wes’ revised draft, I argue that the integration of the external voice helped create a “conversation” and Wes’ inclusion of his suggestions at the end of the paragraph was congruent with “putting <b>your</b> stamp <b>on</b> it.” Despite being a paraphrase, his rough draft lacked dialogic voicing and stance with the lack of integration of external voice and bare assertions, which also created contractive voicing. Even though the external voice and Wes had the same argument, which may contract the dialogue, the use of another’s voice and modality (should) opened up the conversation for the reader to consider the propositions rather being forced to concur with them.|$|R

The game features an [...] "Xmas Spirit Meter" [...] light which dims for every mutant tree missed or elf hit by mistake.

50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{drawback}} {{of the game}} is the lack of time compression. During the Colombian campaign missions are short, lasting less than 15 minutes in most cases, but the Latvian campaign missions may involve travelling more than 100 kilometers round-trip. The player may turn on autopilot during these long transit periods but must still stay alert for enemy contact. Depending <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> this either increases the immersion experience or wastes time. Players should not be concerned about playing the same long mission over and over again, though, because the campaigns, although linear, can be played by accepting your defeats and team's casualties and {{moving on to the next}} mission.|$|E
