50|$|Since the {{cartridge}} extractor or ejector {{is built into}} the barrel assembly on break <b>open</b> <b>actions,</b> the breech face is simply a flat plate with a hole for the firing pin to project. This makes break <b>open</b> <b>actions</b> ideal for interchangeable barrel firearms, such as the popular Thompson Center Arms Contender and Encore pistols. The simplicity of the break open design, especially external hammer types, also reduces the cost of manufacture. There were a number of companies, such as H&R Firearms, that produced break open rifles at lower costs than comparable bolt action rifles.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} magazine {{can hold}} 3-5 rounds, loaded through the <b>open</b> <b>action.</b> Aftermarket 5- and 10-round removable box magazine systems are available, {{similar to the}} Type 38 infantry rifle.|$|R

2500|$|Further, {{although}} human <b>actions</b> <b>flow</b> from prior {{causes that}} ultimately arise in God, and therefore {{are known as}} a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a [...] "wonderful spontaneity" [...] that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.|$|R
30|$|Fu et al. [96] {{proposed}} a NIDS {{that depends on}} signature-based and protocol-based anomaly detection. The proposed IDS structure focuses on detecting attacks on IoT networks without being affected by the heterogeneity of such a network. The detection method depends on comparing the abstracted <b>action</b> <b>flows</b> in the data packets against three databases based on the protocol type information for each packet. These databases are a standard protocol library, an abnormal action library and a normal action library. The {{proposed a}}pproach consists of an event monitor, an event database, an event analyzer, and a response unit. This approach provides a uniform intrusion detection method for IoT networks based on automata theory. The main features of this system are the classification of attacks into three categories {{and the development of}} graphical user interface (GUI) tools to graphically present the abstract <b>action</b> <b>flows</b> and detect possible intrusions.|$|R
2500|$|Methods {{of attack}} {{included}} sniping, IEDs and other tactics used by guerrilla armies when facing an enemy with superior forces.

5|$|Frankel praised Livolsi {{for making}} the film's four key montages—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. The third was {{particularly}} challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove B-roll footage in to keep the <b>action</b> <b>flowing.</b>|$|R
50|$|With The Heist Campbell Cooley {{wanted to}} tell a character-driven story without {{dialogue}} and, {{to add to the}} complexity of the challenge, he also underscored the entire story to a minuet by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, writing the story to the music.

50|$|Sleeves {{that exceed}} the chamber length are {{generally}} used in break <b>open</b> <b>actions,</b> which allow easy insertion and removal. Like supplemental chambers, caliber conversion sleeves completely surround the new cartridge case, but cannot be ejected or fed from a magazine, so they only offer {{a single shot}} per barrel without manual extraction and reloading.|$|R
5000|$|The central {{object in}} FRG is a scale-dependent {{effective}} action functional [...] often called average <b>action</b> or <b>flowing</b> <b>action.</b> The {{dependence on the}} RG sliding scale [...] is introduced by adding a regulator (infrared cutoff) [...] to the full inverse propagator [...] Roughly speaking, the regulator [...] decouples slow modes with momenta [...] by giving them a large mass, while high momentum modes are not affected.

50|$|Modern double-barreled shotguns, often {{known as}} doubles, are almost universally break <b>open</b> <b>actions,</b> with the barrels tilting {{up at the}} rear to expose the breech ends of the barrels for {{unloading}} and reloading.
