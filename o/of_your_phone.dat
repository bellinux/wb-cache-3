But in what circumstances can police search your phone? Must they obtain a search warrant? And what will happen if you refuse to provide your passcode or fingerprint required to access your phone?

Clearly, the phone could use checkins based on location to infer {{that if you are}} in a cafe, for ex-ample, there is a good possibility you might eat or drink something. In this paper, we use inferred behavioral data and location history to predict if you are going to eat or not in the near future. These predictors could serve as a basis for future eating trackers that work unobtrusively in the background <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> rather than relying on bur-densome user input. We report on a simple model that predicts the food purchases of a group of undergraduate college students (N= 25) using inferred behavioral and lo-cation data from smartphones. The 10 -week study uses the dining related purchase records from student college cards as ground-truth to validate our prediction model.

40|$|In {{the world}} we live in today, we have the option to lower costs by {{bundling}} multiple services into one. This may include bundling the cost <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone,</b> broadband, and cable services into one bill, or combining multiple school loans and/or purchasing homeowners insurance to include auto coverage. Similarly, this concept is taking place in the healthcare industry: Bundled Payment systems. What is a bundled payment? A “bundled payment ” allocates a single, negotiated payment to cover a group of treatment services (i. e. surgeries). Under this system, multiple providers are paid a certain amount for all services related to a treatment, condition or episode of care. This payment system pushes providers to provide both high quality care and cost-effective care. How may I learn more? The American Medical Association (AMA) Innovators Committee has proffered a great deal of information on the bundled payment concept including a physician payment reform manual. The manual concentrates on allocating fair payment between physicians, non-physician providers (NPPs) and facilities. The AMA Innovators focus on global budgets and episode-based bundles. Throughout the document, the AMA Innovators refer to new delivery and payment models as Fee-for-Value (FFV) arrangements. The manual provides you with a better understanding of: Building partnerships with other healthcare stakeholders Defining key components a FFV contract Identifying services and providers included in a FFV model Analyzing per-capita cost Analyzing the quality of care Rewarding staff for achieving all quality and cost benchmarks Aligning value and productivity The AMA Innovators recognize that new payment models will not completely replace Fee-For-Servic...|$|E
40|$|The Citizens, Not Suspects {{campaign}} aims {{to fight}} the proposals of mandatory data retention legislation in Australia. On 13 th October 2015, the mandatory data retention legislation comes into force in Australia, but the implementation process is in disarray. As the next election approaches {{we need to keep}} the pressure on to have this legislation reviewed. The government’s proposed extensions to National Security powers pose serious threats to the security, privacy and freedom of all Australians. Among these proposals are: mandatory retention for two years of data relating to the internet and telecommunications activity of all Australians. This data could include records <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> calls and texts, your location (if you use a mobile phone) and who you send emails to and who you receive them from. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee said when he was down under last year, retention of data on this scale “is so dangerous, you have {{to think of it as}} dynamite”. giving ASIO the power to ‘disrupt’ computers by adding, modifying or deleting files. giving ASIO the power to spy on a number of computers – including a whole computer network – under a single computer-access warrant. giving ASIS (Australia’s foreign intelligence agency) the power to collect intelligence on Australian citizens overseas. creating a new criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for revealing information about ‘special intelligence operations’. This comes with no exceptions and would apply to journalists, even if they were unaware that they were revealing information about such an operation. Taken together, these and the other proposals would create the potential for government surveillance on a massive and unprecedented scale, with serious implications for the privacy and civil liberties of all Australians. They could have a serious chilling effect on free speech by inducing people to self-censor. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has called the anti-whistleblower section of this legislation (section 35 P) ‘an unprecedented overreach’ by the government that the Labor Party will be opposing. We believe these proposals undermine the presumption of innocence and would create a situation where all Australians would be considered potential suspects, rather than enjoying the freedom from government surveillance and interference that we deserve as citizens of a democracy...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{academic}} discussion of federated authentication, and quite some political manoeuvring about ‘e-ID’. The grand vision, which {{has been around for}} years in various forms but was recently articulated in the US National Strategy for Trustworthy Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), is that a single logon should work everywhere [1]. You should be able to use <b>your</b> identity provider <b>of</b> choice to log on anywhere; so you might use your driver’s license to log on to Gmail, or use your Facebook logon to file your tax return. More restricted versions include the vision of governments of places like Estonia and Germany (and until May 2010 the UK) that a government-issued identity card should serve as a universal logon. Yet few systems have been fielded at any scale. In this paper I will briefly discuss the four existing examples we have of federated authentication, and then go on to discuss a much larger, looming problem. If the world embraces the Apple vision <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mobile <b>phone</b> becoming <b>your</b> universal authentication device—so that <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> contains half-a dozen credit cards, a couple of gift cards, a dozen coupons and vouchers, your AA card...|$|R

Many {{third parties}} desire to {{discover}} and disclose your location with the help <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cell <b>phone.</b> Using an embedded GPS, phone software will commonly reveal coordinates to carriers, advertisers, and applications. Can a remote party determine locational information absent explicit GPS information? For example, given a known starting or ending point, can a streaming music server distinguish the path you’ve taken through the physical world? We show that the path a cell phone and its owner take from or to a known location can be determined from remote observations of changes in TCP throughput. Empirically, our method can correctly determine with greater than 78 % accuracy the path taken by phone from one of four paths, and with 63 % accuracy the path taken from among eight paths. ...|$|R

But it’s very important that these text messages stand out from any other text messages for reasons we’re about to tell you.
