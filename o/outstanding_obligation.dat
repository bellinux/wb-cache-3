6000|$|His creditor, at {{the hour}} it suited her, {{transferred}} her {{base of operations}} to town, to which impenetrable scene she had also herself retired; and his raising of the first Two Hundred, during five exasperated and miserable months, and then of another Seventy piecemeal, bleedingly, after long delays and under the epistolary whiplash cracked by the London solicitor in his wretched ear even to an effect of the very report of Miss Cookham's tongue--these melancholy efforts formed a scramble up an arduous steep where steps were planted and missed, and bared knees were excoriated, and clutches at wayside tufts succeeded and failed, on a system to which poor Nan could have intelligently entered only {{if she had been}} somehow less ladylike. She kept putting into his mouth the sick quaver of where he should find the rest, the always inextinguishable rest, long after he had in silent rage fallen away from any further payment at all--at first, he had but too blackly felt, for himself, to the still quite possible non-exclusion of some penetrating ray of [...] "exposure." [...] He didn't care a tuppenny damn now, and in point of fact, after he had by hook and by crook succeeded in being able to unload to the tune of Two-Hundred-and-Seventy, and then simply returned the newest reminder of his <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligation</b> unopened, this latter belated but real sign of fight, the first he had risked, remarkably caused nothing at all to happen; nothing at least but his being moved to quite tragically rueful wonder as to whether exactly some such demonstration mightn't have served his turn at an earlier stage.|$|E

Instead, the rent is {{reclassified}} as interest and obligation payments, similarly to a mortgage (with the interest calculated each rental period on the <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligation</b> balance). At the same time, the asset is depreciated. If the lease has an ownership transfer or bargain purchase option, the depreciable {{life is the}} asset's economic life; otherwise, the depreciable life is the lease term. Over {{the life of the}} lease, the interest and depreciation combined will be equal to the rent payments.|$|E

50|$|As {{important}} as the first two compensations of A)Cash and B)Land were, without questions the most critical and financial sustaining to all other ANCSA Corporations (Both Region and Villages) was the final compensation of C) 7(i) program. The 7(i) program provided all other ANCSA Corporations with an annual recapitalization worth {{millions of dollars to}} each of the 12 ANCSA Region. It has been said that without the annual supply of 7(i)recapitalization funds, at least 8 of the 12 regional corporation would be insolvent today. The fact that the 13th Regional Corporation lasted more than 30 years without any access to 7(i) funding in any form is nothing short of amazing. It is also noteworthy that in the year that the 13th became insolvent with an <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligation</b> of approximately $2.5 million, if it had participated equally with the other 12 regions, it would have received approximately $5 million in 7(i) funding and not have been insolvent.|$|E
50|$|The {{budget for}} the {{courthouse}} project was $26,000. However the initial construction contract was broken and the building was completed with separate contracts {{at a much higher}} total cost. In the meantime the county issued a $75,000 bond and quantities of scrip to cover other county obligations that were charged to the courthouse project. With the decline of mining in the county tax assessments fell and the county failed to keep up with interest charges and made no payments at all on principal. An attempted repudiation of the debt in the 1880s failed. Finally, in 1907 the Nevada legislature established a plan to redeem the debt at 65% of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligation,</b> with part of the debt undertaken by Clark County, newly created from the southern part of Lincoln County in 1909. The debt was retired in 1938, the same year that the new courthouse was built. The 1872 courthouse was alleged at the time to be unstable and deteriorating.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} law of {{pledging}} as presented in the early Irish laws and draws connections to its relations within the overall system of security. At the centre of my research stands the question what pledges Irish law recognised and how their application was determined, so as to provide a paradigm for {{the law of}} pledging in its entirety. A pledge is usually a movable, material object of symbolic and economic worth that is given to another person as a security deposit for an <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligation.</b> The main findings of this thesis are a first paradigm {{of the law of}} pledging and a methodological and contextual categorisation of all types of pledges that opens doors for future research into property law. The combined discussion of pledges, hostages and sureties offers the reader insight into a triple method of security and its differences. Moreover, the close relationship between given pledges and distrained pledges is unravelled for the first time. Of further note is the comparative investigation into pledging. Therein, the reader is presented with how pledges are used in Welsh, Salic, Lombard, Visigothic, and Burgundian law. The objective is to offer the reader a view into the possibilities of pledging and to provide a framework against which the Irish evidence can be probed, which reveals how sophisticated and attentive to detail the Irish laws were. Finally, a translation of the primary source text Bretha im &# 7710;uillemu Gell (Judgements concerning Pledge-interests) is made available to the reader in the Appendix. </p...|$|E

50|$|Favours given are not {{immediately}} repaid and returning of favours {{may take a}} long time. Such intervening time period is governed by the norm of reciprocity in two manners. First, the stakeholder is assembling, mobilizing, liquidating resources or assets {{so as to make}} a suitable repayment. Second, it is a time period that the relevant party should not do harm to people who have given them benefits; people are morally constrained to demonstrate gratitude towards or maintain peace with their benefactors. As such, <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligations</b> can thus contribute to the stabilising of social systems by encouraging mutually beneficial exchange and cooperative behaviours.|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, the CDO market (especially the mortgage-backed CDO market) was growing significantly. The monolines became {{involved}} in more of these transactions, typically by selling credit default swap (CDS) protection on the CDO tranches.

This business contributed to the monolines’ growth during this period, with the total amount of <b>outstanding</b> <b>obligations</b> insured by the monolines reaching $3.3 trillion in 2006. In 2006, this contingent liability was backed by approximately $47 billion of claims-paying resources, all in compliance with Article 69 and other states’ financial guaranty insurance statutes and with capital adequacy guidelines set by the rating agencies.|$|R

In 1928, an auditing committee was appointed to inspect the accounts of the fraternity. Furthermore, it became mandatory that the records of Sigma Alpha Rho be held open to all brothers at all times. Another rule passed this year provided that all chapters which failed to pay their per capita tax would be excluded from representation in the National Executive Councils.|$|R
