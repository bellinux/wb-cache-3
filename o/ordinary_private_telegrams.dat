60|$|Not {{only were}} there {{those on the}} {{business}} of the Mica Company, but Mr. Darby, the storekeeper at Akeville, thought it necessary {{to send a message to}} Hetertown by the new line, and there were two or three other <b>private</b> <b>telegrams,</b> that would probably never have been sent had it not been for the novelty of the thing.|$|R
25|$|A radio {{direction}} finder {{of the kind}} then used by large passenger ships employed a rotatable loop antenna to determine the airship's position from any two land radio stations or ship-based transmitters from ships with known positions. During the airship's transatlantic flight to the United States in October 1928, the radio room sent 484 <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> and 160 press telegrams.|$|R

Letters received afterward confirmed this news, and said that Mr. Gray was improving and would get well. Later letters spoke less hopefully of his case; and finally came one announcing his death. A good man, a most companionable and manly man, and worthy of a kindlier fate.|$|R

A staff of three radio operators communicated with ground stations and ships, performed radio navigation, received weather reports, and sent <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> for passengers. A one-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter (about 140 watt antenna power) was used to send telegrams over the low frequency (500–3,000m) bands. A 70 watt antenna power emergency transmitter was available for both telegraph and radio telephone over 300–1,300m wavelength bands which could be powered by either batteries or the gasoline generator.|$|R

The first 230 guard troops arrived before nightfall on September 21, and by nightfall on September 22 there were 653 guardsmen protecting the mines from further attacks. Governor McIntire admonished Brigadier General E. J. Brooks in a <b>private</b> <b>telegram</b> to be impartial, not to take sides, and [...] "Protect all parties alike from violence."

25|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) {{services were}} introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of <b>private</b> <b>telegrams</b> by seamen.

Wireless telephony was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast. In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by wireless transmission. From 1927 new spark-gap transmitters over 300watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940. Implementation of vacuum tube transmitters was slow: by 1937, 600 of 1000 Norwegian ships with a ship radio still had spark-gap transmitters. The coast stations all received vacuum tube transmitters by 1935.|$|R

More to the point, the telegrams revealed Overheu's hatred of Aborigines, a view supported by a statement to Detective Sergeant Manning by Lyddie, that it was Overhue who continually urged the police to kill the prisoners.|$|R
