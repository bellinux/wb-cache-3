Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted {{raids on}} Parliamentary {{forces in the}} region, representing a continuing challenge. No action had been taken, however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E

5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> cultural {{practices of the}} Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E

The high-level cantilever bridge crosses the Manchester Ship Canal on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge spanned the River Mersey {{prior to its}} later diversion into the Manchester Ship Canal. Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained.

5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home his advantage however, and {{over the next few months}} Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E

There is also a Romford F.C. associated with the town. Romford Bowls Club, the premier bowls club in Essex, is based in Lodge Farm Park. The town is strongly associated with the electronic music group Underworld.|$|E
5|$|In the 1983 concept plan, 413 {{plant species}} were identified, {{including}} 124 {{that were not}} native to the park. The park was noted as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> significant areas of bushland in the foothills. By 2006, the flora list contained 411 species, with 107 of these non-native. Five of the native species were then noted as rare or vulnerable, including Prasophyllum pallidum (pale leek-orchid). The park has significant stands of pink gums (Eucalyptus fasciculosa) and long-leafed box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx). button daisy, pussy tail (Ptilotus macrocephalus), needlebush (Hakea sericea), silky guinea flower (Hibbertia sericea) and black rapier sedge (Lepidosperma carphoides) are common. black-boys (Xanthorrhoea), hop bush (Dodonaea viscosa ssp. spatulata) and tea-tree form the understory {{in parts of the}} park. The area around the ruins of Newman's Nursery is noted for its spring orchid display. Quarry floors have large plants typical of much of the Mount Lofty Ranges. Golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) and drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata), as well as red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), native pine (Callitris preissii) and blue gum (Eucalyptus leucoxylon) are common.|$|E

5|$|After {{pitching}} {{with the}} Athletics in spring training, manager Connie Mack placed Christopher {{on the major}} league roster, and he made his debut on April 14, 1942. On May 5, Christopher made his first appearance as a starting pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. The Athletics won the game, 2–1, and {{he got his first}} major league win. After another win five days later, he began a long losing streak. Many of the games he did pitch were in relief, including a game in June against the Cleveland Indians where he only allowed one hit in three innings. He got his third win of the season three months after his second on August 20 in a 2–1 victory over the Washington Nationals. He finished the season with a 4–13 record, a 3.82 ERA, 30 total games, 58 strikeouts and 99 walks. The following season, Christopher re-signed with the Athletics, and was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> pitchers from the previous year on the team, the rest having been called to serve in World War II. He began the season in the starting rotation, winning his first start of the season against the Boston Red Sox in a 5–0 shutout. Over the course of the season, he converted to a sidearm pitching delivery, which led to three victories in a row for him. After a July 9 loss to the Tigers brought his record to 4–6, Christopher did not pitch again until August 24, and {{spent the rest of the}} season pitching in relief. He finished the season with a 5–8 record and a 3.45 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz Wilhelm {{was never}} raised for scrapping, {{unlike most of}} the other capital ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Kronprinz Wilhelm and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles {{as part of an effort}} to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} calm, swift Parliament foundered on {{the rocks}} of {{religious}} conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>remaining</b> Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents. Coke and Cecil, the government's two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end {{the debate over the}} bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking {{until the end of the}} Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no more action was taken on the two Puritan bills.|$|E
