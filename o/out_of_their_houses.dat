5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> and executing them. The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|The 2004 book Weird N.J. (a tie-in to the History Channel TV series Weird U.S.) chronicled, {{failed to}} prove, yet further popularized {{one of the}} lesser-known local urban legends of the US, [...] "albino colonies". The book uses alleged firsthand {{accounts}} mailed to the authors to {{paint a picture of}} various locations in the U.S. (most notably Clifton, New Jersey) where aggregations of albinistic families were said to live in seclusion. The accounts tell tales of honking horns to try to bring the residents <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses,</b> of gawkers being shot at by residents, and even of gangs of local albinistic vigilantes.|$|E

Jersey had 185,000 items of furniture looking for owners. A small number of people were ordered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> on short notice when the house was requisitioned, this might be for accommodation or for fortification reasons, which could result in demolition. People had to get used to German soldiers just walking into their houses from the street for a look around or to [...] "borrow" [...] something.|$|E
2500|$|In 1777, Fisher and his {{brothers}} refused to deliver their firm's business records to the authorities, and since they were Quakers they refused {{to swear an oath}} of allegiance. [...] Fisher, along with {{his brothers}} Thomas and Meirs, and about twenty other Quakers were exiled to Winchester, Virginia where they were kept under house arrest for a year. Although they were treated somewhat harshly they survived without severe illness, but their brother-in-law Thomas Gilpin and John Hunt died. They were allowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> to dine elsewhere and received mail and guests. They were eventually pardoned and allowed to return to Philadelphia by order of George Washington and the Congress after the British evacuated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{neighborhood}} {{divided over}} {{their feelings about}} police were united against their aggression. [...] "The streets were {{full of people who}} I see coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> every morning with briefcases...I mean people who work on Wall Street, and they're standing in the street screaming 'Kill the pigs!'" [...] said Phil Van Aver, a member of Manhattan Community Board 3. Board 3 and the nonprofit social service organizations supported the goal of clearing Tompkins Square Park of the drug dealers, drunks, addicts and anti-social elements that considered it home. [...] Instead, the police riot ripped open old wounds about brutality and the neighborhood's housing problem many longtime residents faced. [...] "The police, by acting in the brutal fashion that they did, managed to link a small group of crazies to the legitimate sentiments of opposition to gentrification," [...] said Valerio Orselli, director of the Cooper Square Committee, a nonprofit housing group. [...] "Now the issue has become police brutality, not housing. It's set everyone back." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Somali National Movement {{attacked}} and captured {{the city of}} Burao (then the third largest city in the country) on Friday 27 May. They captured the town in two hours and immediately took over the military compound at the airport (where {{the largest number of}} soldiers were stationed), the Burao central police station and the prison, where they freed political prisoners (including schoolchildren) from the city's main jail. The government forces retreated, regrouped at Goon-Ad just outside the city, and in the late afternoon, entered the centre of town. According to reports by Human Rights Watch's Africa Watch, the soldiers, upon entering the city, went on a rampage on 27 and 28 May. This included [...] "dragging men <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> and shooting them at point blank range" [...] and summary killing of civilians, the report also noted that [...] "civilians of all ages who had gathered in the centre of town, or those standing outside their homes watching the events were killed on the spot. Among the victims were many students." [...] There was also widespread looting by the soldiers, and some people were reportedly killed as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ships of}} San Sebastian resorted to several bays {{on the west}} coast. The first was found by the English in Grønfjorden on 9 June (OS). Four were found in [...] "Boules Bay" [...] (Goeshaven), Hornsund on 13 June (OS), and another in Isfjorden on 19 June (OS). In all, the English found at least seven of the ships from San Sebastian, seizing their baleen and oil and taking their whaling gear and {{equipment}} before sending them home. The remaining five, unable to defend themselves against such encroachments, apparently left Spitsbergen upon learning they would share the same fate as their comrades if discovered by the English fleet. The San Sebastian merchants claimed a total loss of more than 200,000 ducats, threatening to seize the property of English merchants residing in San Sebastian. Fearing not only for their goods but for their lives as well, many of the English merchants fled to Bilbao, while others [...] "dared not stir <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> lest they should be killed." [...] Formal protests were filed and diplomatic negotiations held, but nothing ever came of them. The Spanish ambassador to England, Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar, spoke with King James I about the matter, but {{was never able to}} receive satisfaction. Aguilar (1986), citing two secondary sources (Fernandez Duro 1881; Ciriquiain 1979) and one primary source (Colección Vargas Ponce, Museo Naval (Madrid), 1613), states that Spanish Basque whaling had reached the [...] "northernmost" [...] coast of Greenland by 1613. Given the fact this is impossible (the northernmost coast of Greenland is inaccessible due to ice) and that the name Greenland was often applied to Spitsbergen, it seems likely that these sources were in reference to the vessels sent to Spitsbergen the same year.|$|E
