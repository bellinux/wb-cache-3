40|$|Background: Although {{the burden}} of {{neurological}} disorders is highest among populations in developing countries there is a dearth of data on the clinical spectrum of these disorders. Objective: To profile the frequency of neurologic disorders and basic demographic data in an adult neurology <b>out-patient</b> <b>service</b> commissioned in 2011 in Kumasi, Ghana. Methods: The study was conducted at the neurology clinic of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Over a three year period, all medical records of patients enrolled at the out-patient neurology clinic was reviewed by a neurologist and neurological diagnoses classified according to ICD- 10. Results: 1812 adults enrolled for care in the neurology <b>out-patient</b> <b>service</b> between 2011 and 2013. This comprised of 882 males and 930 females (male: female ratio of 1. 0 : 1. 1) with an overall median age of 54 (IQR, 39 – 69) years. The commonest primary neurological disorders seen were strokes, epilepsy and seizure disorders, and movement disorders at frequencies of 57. 1 %, 19. 8 %, and 8. 2 % respectively. Conclusions: Cerebrovascular diseases, epilepsy and movement disorders were among the commonest neurological disorders and the major contributors to neurologic morbidity among Ghanaians in an urban neurology clinic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{existing}} empirical micro-level models {{of demand for}} <b>out-patient</b> physician <b>services</b> where the size of patient payment is included either directly as an independent variable (when a flat-rate co-payment fee) or indirectly as a level of deductibles and/or co-insurance defined by the insurance coverage. The paper also discusses the relevance of these models {{for the assessment of}} patient payment policies. For this purpose, a systematic literature review is carried out. In total, 46 relevant publications were identified. These publications are classified into categories based on their general approach to demand modeling, specifications of data collection, data analysis, and main empirical findings. The analysis indicates a rising research interest in the empirical micro-level models of demand for <b>out-patient</b> physician <b>services</b> that incorporate the size of patient payment. Overall, the size of patient payments, consumer socio-economic and demographic features, and quality of services provided emerge as important determinants of demand for <b>out-patient</b> physician <b>services.</b> However, there is a great variety in the modeling approaches and inconsistencies in the findings regarding the impact of price on demand for <b>out-patient</b> physician <b>services.</b> Hitherto, the empirical research fails to offer policy-makers a clear strategy on how to develop a country-specific model of demand for <b>out-patient</b> physician <b>services</b> suitable for the assessment of patient payment policies in their countries. In particular, theoretically important factors, such as provider behavior, consumer attitudes, experience and culture, and informal patient payments, are not considered. Although we recognize {{that it is difficult to}} measure these factors and to incorporate them in the demand models, it is apparent that there is a gap in research for the construction of effective patient payment schemes...|$|R

40|$|Stigma may {{interfere}} with mental health service use. We measured self-stigma and stigma-related cognitions (group identification and perceived legitimacy of discrimination) at baseline in 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or affective disorders. After 6 months, 75 (88 %) had reported use of mental health services. Controlling for baseline psychopathology, perceived stigma and diagnosis, low perceived legitimacy of discrimination predicted use of counselling/psychotherapy. Strong group identification was associated with participation in mutual-help groups. More self-stigma predicted psychiatric hospitalisation. Cognitive indicators of stigma resilience may predict <b>out-patient</b> <b>service</b> use, whereas self-stigma may {{increase the risk of}} psychiatric hospitalisation...|$|R
