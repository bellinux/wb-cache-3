5|$|After the {{previous}} year's race showed lower-than-expected tyre degradation, Pirelli opted {{to supply the}} yellow-banded soft compound as the prime selection and the red-banded supersoft tyre as the option selection. The previous season's event saw Nico Rosberg complete 52 of 53 laps on the white-banded medium compound <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second-place finish. Even with the softer tyre choice, tyre degradation {{was not an issue}} at the event, with drivers able to record fast lap times all through the race on a one-stop strategy.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 2010, against , {{the team}} tied its December 13, 2008 single-game school record of 16 three-point field goals made. In the game, Darius Morris and Tim Hardaway, Jr. {{had been two}} of three Wolverines to make four three-point shots. Morris had had 12 assists <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> double-double. It was Hardaway's first 20-point game. On December 27, the Big Ten Conference named Morris {{player of the week}} and Hardaway co-freshman of the week.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> still-standing {{track record}} of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster {{than the one before}} it. The {{successive}} quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Edward speculated {{heavily in}} real estate, and {{gradually}} lost the family's {{wealth in the}} depression that followed the Panic of 1873. When Louis was seven, the family lost their home, moving to Saratoga, New York, with help from Eliza's family. Edward's health collapsed, but he nonetheless {{took a job as}} a reporter for a Saratoga newspaper, later purchasing a small Democratic paper of his own, The Saratoga Sun. Louis's health, in contrast, improved during his teenage years, allowing him to leave the house more often and consider attending Yale University. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cousin's wedding rehearsal, he suffered a bicycle accident in which he fell into gravel, permanently scarring his face. Ultimately, the dual obstacles of his still-questionable health and finances caused him to abandon his university ambitions and instead take a job with his father's paper.|$|E
5|$|Many of the film's {{actors were}} unknown {{at the time}} of casting. The film was the acting debut of four cast members; Ken Wahl, Tony Ganios, Erland van Lidth and Michael Wright. It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem, who had {{previously}} acted on television. Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors; Wahl was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin, thinking he could play one of the smaller roles in the film. Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California.

Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was too tired to drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah to get some sleep. Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove off in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E

5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him {{trying to get back}} to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in {{the last part of the}} lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Bajana {{returned}} to the Somerset team, playing in six of their twelve County Championship matches. His batting average of 27.55 in that competition was the second-highest amongst his team, bettered only by Jack MacBryan. Bajana hit two half-centuries during the season, scoring 77 against Derbyshire, and 59 against Essex. The following 1920 season was Bajana's last with Somerset. He appeared fifteen times for the county in first-class cricket, averaging just over twenty. In a match against Cambridge University, he achieved his highest first-class score, hitting 14 fours <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> total of 115 runs in 135 minutes. In his next match, he scored a second century for Somerset, and his {{only one in the}} County Championship, scoring 106 runs against Warwickshire. Bajana played his final first-class match against Middlesex in August 1920, scoring six and a duck. In all, Bajana scored 1,975 first-class runs at an average of 20.78. He scored three centuries and seven half-centuries in 96 innings. He was rarely used as a bowler, and took four wickets at an average of 33.00.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{went out}} of the Malta Cup with a 3–5 loss to Michael Holt in the first round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, but lost 4–5 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} a maximum break <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> narrow 5–4 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citroën Coupe, worth €20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6–5 in the semi-finals, and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9–1 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end, O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13–10 (despite losing six frames in a row at one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9–13 against eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|The group reached Albany, New York {{two days}} later, where Joseph Darrow was hired. Hudson also bought $46.50 worth of goods in Albany and nearby Schenectady. A {{few members of}} the group, {{including}} Ira Hudson, left to drive cattle to the settlement. The others then traveled across New York along the Mohawk River valley, passing through Fort Schuyler in Utica (where Jonah Meechum was hired on April 29). The group then arrived at Onondaga (near present-day Syracuse) on May 2, where Richard Blin was hired. They reached East Bloomfield, where Birdsey Norton lived, on May 5. The party replenished its supplies and Hudson met with Benjamin Tappan, who was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> settlement near Hudson's. They agreed to travel together by boat, while another small group herded livestock overland, to their respective settlements. On May 16, 1799, the group, consisting of Hudson, Darrow, Blin, McKinley and Tappan, traveled north to Lake Ontario. Departing in several boats from Oswego, they traveled west towards Lake Erie.|$|E
5|$|Making his Test {{debut at}} the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Craig became, {{at the age}} of 17years and 239days, the {{youngest}} ever Australian to play Test cricket. Australia batted first and Craig received a standing ovation from the 47,000-strong crowd as he walked out to bat amid high expectations from the public. As South African captain Jack Cheetham stopped proceedings to set his field, the crowd jeered. Australia were comfortably positioned at 3/269 with Craig's partner Neil Harvey <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> double century. Craig cover drove his third ball, bowled by Percy Mansell, for four and quickly moved to 20. In an innings marked by leg glances and fine cuts, Craig progressed to 53 before the new ball was taken. He hit a ball into the covers and was caught, ending the 148-run partnership with Harvey and silencing the crowd. Australia collapsed and ended at 520 but still took a first innings lead of 85 runs. Craig top-scored in the second innings with 47, giving him exactly 100runs for the match as Australia collapsed to be all out for 209 and conceded defeat by six wickets. Given Bradman's Test average of 99.94, Craig's match aggregate prompted further press discussions of Bradmanesque similarities. However, his debut ended on a sour note as South Africa scored 4/297 to win by six wickets and level the series 2–2.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{took control}} of most major {{newspapers}} by either buying a controlling stake in them, or by forcing them to shut down. The government also harassed, intimidated, or exiled individual journalists and editors. The newspaper La Prensa, which remained independent and was frequently critical of Noriega, had its staff intimidated and its offices damaged; eventually, it too was forced to close. In May 1984, Noriega allowed the first presidential elections in 16 years. Noriega and Díaz Herrera picked Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino to be the PRD's candidate, {{with the intention of}} keeping him under close control. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes {{were not included in the}} final count. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> meeting, Webber {{goes through}} a red light, and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev {{to spend time with}} her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres about doing this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that he has it, and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go get a life, because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E
