25|$|Network {{capacity}} – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters, {{the former}} head of Lucent's <b>Optical</b> <b>Networking</b> Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics, a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. <b>Optical</b> <b>networking</b> and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen's Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.|$|E

2500|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} multiplexer. [...] The terminal multiplexer {{contains a}} wavelength-converting transponder for each data signal, an optical multiplexer and where necessary an optical amplifier (EDFA). Each wavelength-converting transponder receives an optical data {{signal from the}} client-layer, such as Synchronous <b>optical</b> <b>networking</b> [...] or another type of data signal, converts this signal into the electrical domain and re-transmits the signal at a specific wavelength using a 1,550nm band laser. These data signals are then combined together into a multi-wavelength optical signal using an optical multiplexer, for transmission over a single fiber (e.g., SMF-28 fiber). The terminal multiplexer {{may or may not}} also include a local transmit EDFA for power amplification of the multi-wavelength optical signal. In the mid-1990s DWDM systems contained 4 or 8 wavelength-converting transponders; by 2000 or so, commercial systems capable of carrying 128 signals were available.|$|E

40|$|WDM links as {{the optical}} {{channels}} [1, 2], {{is an alternative}} approach to the TDM-based data <b>networking.</b> <b>Optical</b> data <b>networking</b> eliminates unnecessary protocol stack in each network layer, thus drastically reducing the cost and complexity of networking [3, 4]. In <b>optical</b> data <b>networking,</b> the <b>optical</b> add/drop multiplexer (ADM), located at access nodes, will be key device. A wavelength add/drop mult iplexer (λ-ADM) enables each wavelength to either add/drop and electron ically processes at the node or to optically bypasses the node electronics (Fig. 1 (a)). This capability of optically bypassing a node’s electronic layer can be exploited to reduce overall electronic processing, resulting in the reductions of both the transfer delay {{and the number of}} electronic digital crossconnect switches and routers. λ-ADM can be adopted for different types of traffics such as static or dynamic circuit switching, packet switching, and flow switching [5]. However, λ-ADM is of granularity of wavelength, and this imposes a limit that it can only handle traffic on an optical channel, that is, a wavelength path, and it is unable to handle traffic on a packet-bypacket basis. This may waste the wavelength resource and limit the usage of optical channels. On the other hand, conventional SONET ADM has a finer granularity for handling traffic. It picks out low-speed streams from a highspeed stream and likewise, adds low-speed streams to a high-speed stream [6]. However, the speed of electronic processing will eventually become a bottleneck to the overall processing capability as the bit rate of the WDM link goes higher. Hence, there would be a growing demand for high-speed multi-functional ADM in the future <b>optical</b> data <b>networking,</b> which can handle traffic in finer granularity.
