25|$|Other {{than the}} current {{westbound}} off ramp, existing ramps linking the bridge traffic to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island are inadequate to handle traffic for future expected residential development. In particular, the eastbound off ramp has always been extremely hazardous, while added westbound <b>on</b> <b>ramp</b> traffic would interfere with bridge traffic flow. Between the tunnel's western portal and the existing western suspension span, {{there is no room}} for modern ramp configurations. The developments are expected to add some three thousand residents to the island, as well as business and office space. To support this traffic, a system of new ramps (currently only partially completed) will be built on the eastern side of the islands to link to the YBITS, where there will be adequate room for proper traffic merges and departures. The east-side ramps are expected to cost about $95,670,000 while they began construction on late-2013 for a June 2016 opening. New westbound on- and off-ramps opened on October 22, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{departure}} from the Esplanade terminus, {{at the corner of}} Mandalong Road, trams travelled south-East along The Esplanade. After passing Botanic Road the line swung right onto Henry Plunkett Reserve. From this point the line went off-road and ascended uphill onto its own reservation, travelling through a narrow rock cutting, now public walking track (pictured). After a steep ascent through the reserve the line crossed several small residential streets along the way, such as; Mulbring, Gordon, Plunkett and Beaconsfield Street, before once again entering onto Gordon Street where the line swung right onto Middle Head Road. The tram then joined the main line at the point where Bradleys Head Road, Military Road and Middle Head Road meet. Travelling along Military Road and then Falcon Street, services to Chatswood turned right onto Willoughby Road, and eventually terminated at Chatswood railway station, Victoria Avenue Terminus, while services to Lane Cove travelled along the Pacific Highway, terminating at the Lane Cove council chambers. Services to Wynyard via North Sydney swung left into Miller street before crossing the Pacific Highway and entering onto the <b>on</b> <b>ramp</b> that led to the steel arch bridge that once crossed over the Bradfield Highway and thence to {{the eastern side of the}} Sydney Harbour Bridge.|$|E
