500|$|In a joking nod to {{the sinking}} of his Mercury craft, Grissom named the first Gemini {{spacecraft}} Molly Brown (after the popular Broadway show The Unsinkable Molly Brown); NASA publicity officials were unhappy with this name. When Grissom and his Pilot John Young were ordered {{to come up with}} a new one, they offered Titanic. NASA executives gave in and allowed the name Molly Brown, but did not use it in any official references. Subsequently, and much to the agency's chagrin, on launch CAPCOM Gordon Cooper gave Gemini 3 its sendoff by telling Grissom and Young, [...] "You're <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> Molly Brown!" [...] and ground controllers used this name throughout the flight.|$|E

She comes to the gate– the gate is closed with a human leg; she goes into the yard– there a barrel full of blood; she goes up the stairs– there dead {{children}}; the porch is closed with an arm; on the floor– arms, legs; the door is closed with a finger. Baba Yaga comes to meet her {{at the door and}} asks her, “Have you seen anything, my dear, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to my house?” “I saw,” the girl answers, “the gate closed with a leg.” “That is my iron latch.” “I saw a barrel in the yard full of blood.” “That is my wine, my darling.” “I saw children lying on the stairs.” “Those are my pigs.” “The porch is closed with an arm.” “That is my latch, my golden one.” “I saw in the house a hairy head.” “That is my broom, my curly one,” said Baba Yaga, then got angry with her prying goddaughter and ate her.|$|E

2500|$|Miller {{had sent}} a copy of Joaquin, et al. to Bret Harte, who offered advice that he avoid [...] "faults of excess" [...] and encouragingly wrote, [...] "you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to become a poet."

[...] Cockburn responded [...] "I think Israel is secure. I don't think it's struggling for survival... It's protected by the United States. I don't see any threat to Israel's survival, it's ludicrous to say so. I do see a threat to [...] survival of Palestinians, who are living on what a dollar a day in Gaza." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to control her own destiny, rather than be {{controlled}} by country radio, Loveless made an abrupt move away from commercial, country/pop and made a stone-cold bluegrass album in 2001. Mountain Soul was released to numerous critical accolades and sold decently {{despite a lack of}} radio support. She used the same bluegrass approach on a Christmas album, , in 2002. <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> Home, a return to more commercial oriented country, was released in 2003 to critical acclaim. Though she has not scored a top-forty country single since [...] "On Your Way Home" [...] reached # 29 in 2004, Loveless' albums still do well, usually charting in the country albums top forty, {{despite the fact that she}} no longer has the support of mainstream country radio or a major label.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doors open}} 30 minutes prior to show start due to guests {{coming in and}} taking their seats. Approximately 5 minutes before the show is set to begin, Dave (the cameraman) and Marty (a new crew member) comes out and tells the {{audience}} that they're on location in Italy shooting a scene for a new action movie, directed by Morgan Ross. They ask for individual volunteers from the audience to act out various scenes such as being in an armed hold-up, pointing at the getaway vehicle and ooohing and aaahing at near-misses. The final piece of filming with the audience is a mexican wave featuring all 2000 audience members. Dave then sends Marty off to get the buggy and to reset red rally car. A safety spiel then follows stating [...] "In the interest of safety, ... please do not try anything of what you see here today, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> home".|$|E
2500|$|... "Tea-House Moon" [...] is the album's third {{instrumental}} track. [...] "Once You Had Gold" [...] {{was influenced}} by Enya's experience of singing hymns in her youth, and incorporated its structure and melody into the track. [...] "La Soñadora" [...] is Spanish for [...] "The Dreamer". Its lyrics were inspired by a poem recited by Amergin Glúingel, a Druid of the Milesian race, upon his arrival to Ireland from Spain. Enya has an ancestral connection to Spain through her mother's side of the family; both aspects inspired her to sing it in Spanish, at Roma's suggestion. To Enya, [...] "On My Way Home" [...] is about [...] "those wonderful memories and fond moments that you have when you're <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> home", and wished to present a positive feel in the chorus.

2500|$|The most {{detailed}} {{version of the}} practice is by Cyril of Jerusalem who details how ointment or oil was [...] "symbolically applied to the forehead, and the other organs of sense" [...] and that the [...] "ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed." [...] Cyril states that the [...] "ointment is the seal of the covenants" [...] of baptism and God’s promises to the Christian who is anointed. Cyril taught that being [...] "anointed with the Holy anointing oil of God" [...] was {{the sign of a}} Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, [...] "Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth.
