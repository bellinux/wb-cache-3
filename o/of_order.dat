5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths <b>of</b> <b>order</b> hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are <b>of</b> <b>order</b> a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes <b>of</b> <b>order</b> one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party <b>of</b> <b>Order</b> was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party <b>of</b> <b>Order.</b> With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> possibly {{because he did not}} want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} the Collar <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Charles III and the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur, Knight <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Pius IX, the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Red Eagle, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Saints Maurice and Lazarus, Knight <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Leopold (Belgium), <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Leopold (Austria), Grand Cross <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa, the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Rose, Grand Cross <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> St. Olav, the Grand Cross <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Zähringer Lion, the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Lion and the Sun, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Burma, Knight of Honour of the Sovereign Military <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Malta and <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> St. Charles, among others.|$|R

25|$|The Canadian Forces has {{listed the}} {{following}} orders {{to be worn}} in the following manner: National <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Quebec, Saskatchewan <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Merit, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Ontario, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> British Columbia, Alberta <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Excellence, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Prince Edward Island, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Manitoba, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> New Brunswick, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Nova Scotia and the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Newfoundland and Labrador.

5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} {{far away from the}} imperial capital, {{but one of the most}} important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party <b>of</b> <b>Order</b> or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party <b>of</b> <b>Order,</b> meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in {{the plane of the}} bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{named him}} a Knight <b>of</b> <b>Order</b> of Saint Louis upon the {{restoration}} and placed him {{command of the}} military of the Vosges in October. During the Hundred Days, Napoleon appointed him {{as director of the}} Ministry of War.|$|E

5|$|Many scenes {{concerning}} Jedi deaths {{during the}} execution <b>of</b> <b>Order</b> 66 were cut. The deaths of Barriss Offee and Luminara Unduli were either {{cut from the}} film or not filmed in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} {{discusses}} disorder within nature, which is opposite {{to the discussion}} <b>of</b> <b>order</b> within nature found in the second section of Burnt Norton. Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate for explaining reality. Those who pursue only reason and science are ignorant. Even our progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} repeat the same errors as the past.|$|E
5|$|There is a socio-political cycle <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and {{disorder}} where, {{regardless of who}} is in power, the same injustices take place: when the blacks take control, they betray their own traditions and {{follow the example of}} European states. By means of these repeated scenarios, history is presented as a cyclical re-enactment of the same human dilemmas.|$|E
50|$|His state's awards include 5th and 4th Classes <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Prince Yaroslav the Wise, 3rd Class <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Merit, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Red Banner <b>of</b> Labour, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Badge <b>of</b> Honour, <b>Order</b> for Personal Courage, and Personal Firing Weapon.|$|R

50|$|Van Oyen {{remained}} {{until his}} death in 1953 commander of the Red Cross Corps.

5|$|These {{operations}} {{define a}} symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the symmetric group S81, <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 3!8×2=3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E
5|$|This last case {{accounts}} for the elements of unusually large finite order in πn+k(S'n) for such values of k. For example, the stable groups πn+11(S'n) have a cyclic subgroup <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 504, the denominator of B6/12 = 1⁄504.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure a}} {{free flow of}} funds on Monday, the New York Clearing House issued $100 million in loan {{certificates}} to be traded between banks to settle balances, allowing them to retain cash reserves for depositors. Reassured both by the clergy and the newspapers, and with bank balance sheets flush with cash, a sense <b>of</b> <b>order</b> returned to New York that Monday.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{group is}} the product of a cyclic group <b>of</b> <b>order</b> |12b+6+4b2 + 3b3| and a double cover <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 48 of the octahedral group <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 24.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{dihedral}} group D8 <b>of</b> <b>order</b> sixteen can {{be generated}} by a rotation, r, <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 8; and a flip, f, <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 2; and certainly any element of D8 {{is a product of}} rs and fs.|$|E
25|$|A corner {{reflector}} <b>of</b> <b>order</b> n: {{the origin of}} R2 quotiented out by a dihedral group <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 2n.|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the lineage}} proved their nobility at diverse times serving in <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> knights like the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Santiago, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Alcántara, <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Calatrava and <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> San Juan de Jerusalén (today the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Malta), {{and as well}} in the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Carlos III of Spain.|$|R
