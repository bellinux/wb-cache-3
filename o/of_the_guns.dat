5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|When the British paratroopers had withdrawn, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{were put}} back into {{action by the}} Germans.

5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> that were available were unusable.|$|E

5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|Australia sailed for Devonport, Devon in mid-February 1913 {{to begin}} her {{acceptance}} trials. Testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> torpedoes, and machinery was successful, {{but it was}} discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser to dock for repairs. Australia was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth on 21 June 1913. Two days later, Rear Admiral George Patey, the first Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Fleet, raised his flag aboard Australia.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E

5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{under the command}} of the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{from the}} first España were {{recovered}} and employed in coastal fortifications, some of which remained in service until 1999. Six of Jaime Is 12-inch guns were also salvaged and similarly employed after she was broken up in the 1940sthey too remained in service until they were decommissioned in the mid-1990s. The second España was never raised, and her wreck was discovered in the early 1980s. Several expeditions to survey the wreck took place between February and May 1984.|$|E

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> seen in {{the film}} and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{officers}} and petty officers {{in charge of the}} main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E

This added {{a great amount}} <b>of</b> strength to <b>the</b> frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> and it allowed <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a [...] inch shell without <b>the</b> danger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> constantly jamming.|$|R
5|$|The Erzherzog Ferdinand Max class {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} ironclad warships and built for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s. They were the last broadside armored frigates to be built for the Austrian Empire, and the last vessels completed to see action against the Italians at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Intended to have been armed with new breech-loading Krupp guns, the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War prevented the delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> forcing the Austrian Navy to arm the ships with a battery of sixteen older 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns.|$|E
5|$|The first {{design in}} the second {{generation}} of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conti di Cavour class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered {{in response to the}} French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were significantly improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{were small}} iron guns with short range {{that could be}} aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{traverse}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> {{was limited}} to about 60°. Generally, these pillboxes were positioned to fire along fixed lines, such as enfilading fire across an anti-tank ditch or at a bridge and in such positions <b>the</b> limited traverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> creates no real disadvantage; whereas, <b>the</b> small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embrasure provides greater protection for <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> and its crew.|$|R
60|$|They had {{contrived}} {{an apparatus}} with straps and {{a sort of}} little pocket, in which <b>the</b> muzzle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> went, so that it hung from the saddle down in front <b>of</b> their leg; <b>the</b> stock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> being secured by a strap against <b>the</b> pommel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saddle, at <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> which was their revolver holster. This was an inconvenient way <b>of</b> carrying <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> in some respects, as the strap had to be unfastened to get at it, and <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> a shot thereby lost; but they considered it preferable to the mode they had at first adopted, of riding with their guns slung behind them. This they gave up, because, with the utmost care, they occasionally got a fall, when galloping, from the armadillo holes, and the shock was greatly increased from <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> besides <b>the</b> risk, to any one riding near, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> exploding. When riding quietly, and upon the lookout for game, they carried <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> in readiness upon their arms.|$|R

5|$|To {{defend the}} naval base, heavy 15-inch naval guns (381.0mm) were {{stationed}} at Johore battery, Changi, and at Buona Vista {{to deal with}} battleships. Medium BL 9.2 inch guns (233.7mm) were provided for dealing with smaller attackers. Batteries of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns and guns for dealing with raids were located at Fort Siloso, Fort Canning and Labrador. The five 15-inch guns were all surplus Navy guns, manufactured between 1903 and 1919. Part of their cost was met from a gift of £500,000 from Sultan Ibrahim of Johor for the Silver Jubilee of the coronation King George V. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were given an all-round (360°) traverse and subterranean magazines.|$|E
5|$|When Blake reached Carn Near on {{the south}} end of Tresco, he {{constructed}} an artillery position for a battery of three guns overlooking the channel between the island and St Mary's, as well as the harbour of St Mary's Pool, hoping to pressure the Royalists into surrender. The work was carried out rapidly between 19 April and 4 May, possibly reusing the site of a Bronze Age burial cairn. When the battery began firing on 4 May, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> exploded causing two deaths, but the bombardment soon recommenced and St Mary's agreed to surrender several weeks later on 23 May.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} Mark 2 {{was tested}} and proven on 8 April 1918, {{and the gun}} was scheduled to go into naval service in 1923. However, with the cancellation of both the Lexington and the South Dakota classes, no guns were installed on any ships even though 71 had been built and 44 were under construction. In 1922–24, twenty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{were given to the}} Army for use as coastal defense guns along with the Army's 16"/50 caliber M1919 guns. Later planning called for the use of these guns in the s, but miscommunication between design bureaus led to the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun being used instead. As a result, all but three of the Navy's remaining Mark 2 and 3 guns were sent to the Army to also be used as coastal defense guns.|$|E
