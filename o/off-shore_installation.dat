40|$|Continuous up-scaling of {{wind turbine}} size into the multi-megawatt class, {{together}} with developments for <b>off-shore</b> <b>installation</b> {{are calling for}} new wind turbine configurations and technologies. High product reliability is {{a key factor in}} these developments, cascaded down to each component manufacturer in the supply chain. Increasing the reliability of wind turbine drive trains for wind turbines with ever increasing size requires dedicated simulation models which can provide more insight in the internal gearbox dynamics {{in the early stages of}} the design process. However, simulation models can only add value to the design process if their results prove to be representative and reliable. Therefore validation based on measurements on real multi-megawatt wind turbine gearboxes is an absolute necessity. For this reason, Hansen Transmissions developed a back-to-back 13 MW test rig set-up capable of dynamically testing gearboxes and validating their dynamical models. This validation is based on three foundations: validation of model parameters, validation in the frequency domain and validation in the time domain. The initial results of the validation of model parameters, validation in the frequency domain and validation in the time domain already demonstrate the added value of multibody gearbox models. Therefore the confidence level in the applicability of multibody simulation models in gearbox design is increased. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} in the Danish sector of the North Sea has always focused on reducing work-related accidents. Over the years, accident rates have been reduced, and near-miss reporting has gained in importance, because it allows the industry to learn from experience and prevent further accidents. Because of this importance, oil and gas companies use many resources to register and analyse near misses. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate near-miss reporting for the Danish offshore installations and to examine what the industry learns from near-miss reporting and how these reports can be used in the prevention of accidents. Data: Data are derived from three oil and gas companies in the Danish sector of the North Sea. The material consists of documentary data such as procedures and reports as well as interviews and a database including near-miss reports. The near misses have been divided into thematic groups, and two types of near misses were chosen for further analysis: gas leaks and person related incidents. Methods: Thematic analyses of documentary material, accident prevention procedures and selected near-miss cases. Results: The preliminary results show that all companies have procedures and systems for accident and near-miss reporting. The paper shows that there are challenges and barriers for the use of near-miss reporting systems with regard to learning and improving the safety of <b>off-shore</b> <b>installations,</b> and suggestions are made for improvements...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of causes for human errors reveals that deficiencies in organization and management often provide an environment making errors more likely. There is also a considerable difference between the operational performance of similar industrial plants. A closer {{analysis of}}ten reveals that the differences {{can be attributed to}} the managing practices. Accepting organization and management as one important precursor for operational safety, the aim is to identify good managerial structures and practices as well as characteristics of unsafe operational practices. Such information can provide guidance for the operators of the installations and also support regulatory agencies. The ultimate aim should be to detect and correct organizational deficiencies before an incident or accident brings them into the open. It is therefore not sufficient to blame individuals nor training, because management and organization establishes priorities, structures, and practices that enable tasks to be accomplished. A consultants' meeting organized jointly by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) was held in Laxenburg and Vienna, Austria on 18 - 22 March 1991. The objective of the meeting was to assess the extent to which research within the management sciences -can provide guidance for the practical problems of managing organizations, where safety is the major concern. The influence of organization and management on the safety of complex industrial installations was discussed during the meeting and the exchange of ideas and experience between different industrial sectors and the academia proved fruitful. In spite of the difference among national and company practices it is still expected that there are many possibilities for an exchange of good managerial knowledge, experience, and practices. The report collects both the contributions offered by members of the Expert Task Force and the findings of the discussions that took place during the meeting. Specific reference is in the following text made to the nuclear industry with the understanding that the issues have a wider application to chemical plants, <b>off-shore</b> <b>installations</b> or more generally to industries where safety is a major concern...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrated}} Coastal Zone and Shelf Sea Research (INTERCOAST) organization, {{a cooperative}} German and New Zealand multidisciplinary research program, concentrates on scientific issues {{in social and}} natural science disciplines in the both countries. INTERCOAST 4 (IC 4) Ph. D. program tackled geotechnically problematic soft soils such as peat, clay and clayey silts which have posed considerable challenges to geotechnical engineers {{in all parts of}} the world during design and construction process. In Germany, peat is one of the prevailing groups of soil which is present in both off-shore and on-shore areas and exhibit properties such as high compressibility and low shear strength; these properties may cause complications such as differential settlement or failure in structures built on such soils. Removal or stabilization are the most important methods used to overcome geotechnical problems related to peat soilsâ engineering characteristics. In New Zealand, many off-shore and on-shore areas of the North Island are covered by volcanic ash, and weathering of this material has resulted in formation of clay minerals. Dredging of volcanic ash layers often causes major turbidity in the water column and poses risks to wildlife and humans. Due to very low effective shear strength and high sensitivity of volcanic ash, these sediments are not considered to be appropriate for <b>off-shore</b> construction and <b>installation</b> purposes. On-shore weathered volcanic ash having low permeability acts as a barrier to fluid flow, for example infiltration of rainfall, and prevents pore pressure from dissipating. This special characteristic may lead to failure of slopes with volcanic ash materials because increases in pore pressure lowers the effective normal (vertical) stress, and therefore shear strength. The aim of this dissertation is to utilize in-situ and laboratory measurements in order to (i) present soil mechanical intervention for stabilization of peat using cost-effective and environmentally-friendly stabilization method and focus on a comparison between mechanical characteristics of undisturbed and stabilized peat, (ii) investigate geological setting, lithology and depositional history of off-shore sub-seafloor volcanic soils and determine geotechnical properties of near-surface sediments and (iii) look into the role of volcanic soils in occurrence of on-shore landslides...|$|R
40|$|The city of Taranto, in the {{south-east}} of Italy, {{is experiencing}} a transition {{from one of the}} most polluted and industrialized area characterized by the presence of the largest integrated steelworks in Europe, to a center of attractions of investments in innovation on sustainability and tourism. Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, {{in the first year of}} investigation from May 1 st, 2009 to April 30 th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12. 27 % and SSW with 9. 89 % of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10. 94 %. In the second year, from May 1 st, 2010 to April 30 th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12. 56 % of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9. 33 %, while the calms reached 11. 08 %. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1. 84 (sd= 0. 26 m/s) in the first year and 1. 90 m/s (sd= 0. 30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull’s k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0. 639) the highest in June 2010 (1. 665). Mean yearly values of k were 1. 210 (sd= 0. 18) in the first year and 1. 065 (sd= 0. 24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R²= 0. 59 (p= 0. 043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0. 1 kW, ranged from 0. 12 to 10. 6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some <b>off-shore</b> and on-shore <b>installations,</b> biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies.

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} a fast-growing {{sustainable}} energy technology and {{driven by the}} need for more efficient energy harvesting, size of the wind turbines has increased over the years for both <b>off-shore</b> and land-based <b>installations.</b> Therefore, structural health monitoring and maintenance of such turbine structures have become critical and challenging. In order to keep the number of physical inspections to minimum without increasing the risk of structural failure, a precise and reliable remote monitoring system for damage identification is necessary. Condition-based maintenance which significantly improves safety compared to periodic visual inspections, necessitates a method to determine the condition of machines while in operation and involves the observation of the system by sampling dynamic response measurements from a group of sensors and the analysis of the data to determine the current state of system health. This goal is being pursued in this thesis through the development of reliable sensors, and reliable damage detection algorithms. Blade strain is the most important quantities to judge the health of wind turbine structure. Sensing high stress fields or early detection of cracks in blades bring safety and saving in rehabilitation costs. Therefore, high performance strain measurement system, consisting of sensors and interface electronics, is highly desirable and the best choice. It has been revealed that the conventional strain gauge techniques exhibit significant errors and uncertainties when applied to composite materials of wind turbine blades. Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based sensors are very attractive among other sensing techniques owing to high sensitivity, low noise, better scaling characteristics, low cost and higher potential for integration with low power CMOS circuits. MEMS sensors that are fabricated on a chip can be either bonded to the surface of wind turbine blade or embedded into the fiber reinforced composite. Therefore, MEMS technology is selected to fabricate the strain sensor in this work. Two new sensor structures {{that can be used for}} strain measurement are designed. While the proposed sensors focus on high sensitivity, they are based on simple operating principle of comb-drive differential variable capacitances and chevron displacement amplification. Device performances are validated both by analytical solutions and finite element method simulations. The transmission of strain fields in adhesively bonded strain sensors is also studied. In strain sensors that are attached to host structures using adhesive layers such as epoxy, complete strain transfer to the sensor is hindered due to the influence of the adhesive layer on the transfer. An analytical model, validated by finite element method simulation, to provide insight and accurate formulation for strain transfer mechanism for bonded sensors is developed. The model is capable of predicting the strain transmission ratio through a sensor gauge factor, and it clearly establishes the effects of the flexibility, length, and thickness of the adhesive layer and sensor substrate. Several fabrication steps were required to realize the MEMS capacitive strain sensor in our lab. Polycrystalline silicon is selected as the structural layer and silicon nitride as the sacrificial layer. Polysilicon is deposited using LPCVD and SiN is deposited by PECVD in our lab. A comprehensive material study of silicon nitride and polycrystalline silicon layers is therefore performed. The whole fabrication process involves deposition, etching, and photolithography of five material layers. Although this process is developed to realize the MEMS strain sensors, it is also able to fabricate other designs of surface micromachining structures as well. The fabricated MEMS capacitive strain sensors are tested on a test fixture setup. The measurement setup is created under the probe station by using a cantilever beam fixed on one side and free on other side where a micrometer applies accurate displacement. The displacement creates bending stress on the beam which transfers to the MEMS sensor through the adhesive bond. Measurement results are in a good match with the simulation results. Finally, a real-time non-destructive health monitoring technique based on multi-sensor data fusion is proposed. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method to identify and localize damages in wind turbine blades. The structural properties of turbine blade before and after damage are investigated and based on the obtained results, it is shown that information from smart sensors, measuring strains and vibrations, distributed over the turbine blades can be used to assist in more accurate damage detection and overall understanding of the health condition of blades. Data fusion technique is proposed to combine the diagnostic tools to improve the detection system with providing a more robust reading and fewer false alarms...|$|R
