5|$|The Lutheran {{calendar}} is most {{similar to}} the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar <b>of</b> <b>Saints,</b> though it also bears resemblance to the Roman Calendar <b>of</b> <b>Saints</b> because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals.

5000|$|In 862, Odo and {{the monks}} of Glanfeuil {{were obliged to}} flee to Paris {{in the face of}} Vikings maurauding along the Loire. There the cult <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Maurus was revived at the {{suburban}} Parisian abbey of Saint-Pierre-des-Fossés, later renamed Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. The cult <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Maurus slowly spread to monasteries throughout France and by the 11th century had been adopted by Monte Cassino in Italy, along with a revived cult <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Placidus (the fellow pupil <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Benedict at Monte Cassino along with Saint Maurus, according to Pope Gregory the Great's Life <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Benedict). By the late Middle Ages, the cult <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Maurus, often associated with that <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Placidus, had spread to all Benedictine monasteries.|$|R

5|$|An icon <b>of</b> <b>Saints</b> Marina and Jovan Vladimir, dated 1711, {{is part of}} the iconostasis of the Monastery of StNaum near Ohrid {{in western}} Macedonia. The icon's {{position}} on the iconostasis indicates that Vladimir was an important figure of local veneration. He was often depicted in the company <b>of</b> <b>Saints</b> Clement and Naum in Macedonian churches. A number of 18th-century painters from central and southern Albania painted the saint in churches of the region, especially in the area of Moscopole. A portable icon of the saint was created in 1739 at the Ardenica Monastery in southwestern Albania. It depicts him seated on a throne, surrounded by twelve panels showing scenes of his life and miracles. Saint Jovan Vladimir is represented on frescos in three monasteries of Mount Athos: Hilandar, Zograf, and Philotheou; and three Bulgarian monasteries: Rila, Troyan, and Lozen.|$|E
5|$|Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius (518–520) in his De situ terrae sanctae {{mentions}} that 'close to Jacob's Well are {{the remains of}} Joseph the Holy'. The Madaba Mosaic Map (6th century) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – 'Joseph's' (τὸ τοῦ Ὶωσήφ) – where the usual adjective 'holy' (hagios) accompanying mentions <b>of</b> <b>saints</b> and their shrines is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and {{was buried}} at Rouen Cathedral, {{in the chapel}} <b>of</b> <b>Saints</b> Peter and Paul.

5|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{additional}} {{arms were}} attributed to a large number <b>of</b> <b>saints,</b> kings and popes, especially those from the 11th and 12th centuries. Pope Innocent IV (1243–1254) is the first pope whose personal coat of arms is known with certainty (Pastoreau 1997a, 283–284). By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the use of attributed arms became more restrained (Neubecker, 224).|$|E

A string of finely cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower cornice of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of a bulky belfry.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' {{theological}} position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.

50|$|On December 13, 841 AD (4 Koiak), Pope Joseph I {{fulfilled}} the desire <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Pishoy and moved his body (as {{well as that}} <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Paul <b>of</b> Tammah) to the Monastery <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Pishoy in the wilderness of Scetes.

Today, the two bodies lie in the main church of the Coptic Orthodox Monastery <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Pishoy in the Nitrian Desert. Eyewitnesses recount that the body <b>of</b> <b>Saint</b> Pishoy remains in an allegedly incorruptible state to this day.|$|R
