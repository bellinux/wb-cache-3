5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, <b>others</b> <b>that</b> it was a negligence of the captain, and <b>others</b> <b>that</b> it was because of Moreno's frail health.|$|E

5|$|What {{became of}} Hasekura is unknown and {{accounts}} {{of his last}} years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could rely only on hearsay, with some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, <b>others</b> <b>that</b> he was martyred for his faith, and <b>others</b> <b>that</b> he practised Christianity in secret.

For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

5|$|Beadle's de jure {{recognition}} of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and <b>others</b> <b>that</b> he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's electoral defeat soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in Johannesburg on 14 December 1980, aged 75.|$|E

Roger persuaded the <b>others</b> <b>that</b> they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E
