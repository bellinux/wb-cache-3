5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|Adamant was {{at first}} fitted for reserve duty in July 1792, but with the {{outbreak}} <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Revolutionary France in April 1793 she was hurriedly recommissioned, at first under Captain William Bentinck {{and at some point}} in 1794 William Mitchell was her acting-captain. From June 1794 she was under Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby. Darby took Adamant back to the Leeward Islands in September 1794, and by April 1796 Adamant was serving with George Vandeput's squadron. Captain Henry Warre took command in November 1796, and was succeeded by Captain William Hotham on 11 January 1797.|$|E

5|$|Endecott {{was elected}} deputy {{governor}} in 1641 {{and in this}} role {{was one of the}} signatories to the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, which enumerated a number of individual rights available to all colonists, and presaged the United States Bill of Rights. The next few years were quiet, although rumors <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Indians led to the formation in 1643 of the New England Confederation, designed to facilitate united action by the New England colonies against common external threats as well as internal matters like dealing with escaped slaves and fugitives from justice.|$|E

Albania {{did not end}} its state <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Greece, {{left over from the}} Second World War, until as late as 1987 – two years after Hoxha's death – due to suspicions about Greek territorial ambitions in southern Albania (known to Greeks as Northern Epirus) as well as Greece's status as a NATO member state.|$|E

5|$|In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia {{had ended}} the Thirty Years' War, {{during which the}} Swedish Empire emerged as a major European power. In the Torstenson War, a theater of the Thirty Years' War, Sweden had {{defeated}} the former Baltic great power Denmark. Sweden had been at peace with Russia since the Treaty of Stolbovo had ended the Ingrian War in 1617. Sweden had remained in a state <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth since the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), which was concluded by the repeatedly renewed truce (Altmark, Stuhmsdorf).|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, Blamey was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he {{laid the foundation for}} the expansion of the Army in the event <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Germany or Japan, which he now regarded as inevitable. In 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939. On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.|$|E

5|$|MacBride {{ended the}} war serving ashore in Ireland, and in 1784 {{embarked}} on a political career, becoming MP for Plymouth.

5|$|Morton was reelected to office, {{defeating}} Democrat {{and longtime}} friend Joseph McDonald {{by more than}} 20,000 votes. Although the campaign was conducted in time <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> <b>with</b> both parties strongly opposing the other, both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate. Many Democrats claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority {{in both houses of}} the Assembly.|$|E

The following morning, in response to the imminent threat <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Germany, Wainwright began to search for submarines and to patrol Hampton Roads to protect the Fleet and naval bases. Two days later, other warships relieved her on patrol; and she anchored with the Fleet in the mouth of the York River. The next day, 6April 1917, the United States entered World War I.|$|E

5|$|Strategic risk {{posed by}} German {{control of the}} Belgian and {{ultimately}} French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) in the event <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Japan in December 1941, and {{the imminent}} threat of invasion saw the 6th and 7th Divisions {{transferred to the}} Far East in early 1942.

Although Harrison received federal military pay for his service, he also collected a territorial governor's salary from September until December 28, 1812, when he formally resigned as governor and continued his military service.|$|E

5|$|A skilful pilot, Hull {{dedicated}} {{much of his}} pre-war {{service to}} aerobatics, flying Hawker Audaxes, Furies and Hurricanes. He reacted to the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> enthusiasm and achieved No. 43 Squadron's first victory of the conflict in late January 1940. Reassigned to Norway in May 1940 to command a flight of Gloster Gladiator biplanes belonging to No. 263 Squadron, he downed four German aircraft in an hour over the Bodø area south-west of Narvik on 26 May, a feat that earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was shot down the next day, and invalided back to England. Hull returned to action {{at the end of}} August, when he was made commander of No. 43 Squadron with the rank of squadron leader. A week later, he died in a dogfight over south London.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E
5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 Richard and Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the king was ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E
