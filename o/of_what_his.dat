5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

They had a somewhat stormy marriage in which they retained a strong bond despite Macleod conducting a number <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> biographer describes as “romances” with other women (he quotes love letters written by Macleod but does not specifically say they went as far as sexual affairs). As was common for MPs’ wives of the era, Eve looked after constituency matters whilst her husband concentrated on his career at Westminster.|$|E
25|$|In December 1960, Edward Paget ordained Tutu as an Anglican {{minister}} at St Mary's Cathedral. Tutu was then appointed assistant curate in St Alban's Parish, Benoni, {{where he was}} reunited {{with his wife and}} children; they lived in a converted garage. He earned 72.50 rand a month, which was two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> white counterparts were given. In 1962, Tutu was transferred to St Philip's Church in Thokoza, where he was placed in charge of the congregation and developed a passion for pastoral ministry. Many in South Africa's white-dominated Anglican establishment felt the need for a greater number of indigenous Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority; to assist in this, Aelfred Stubbs proposed that Tutu be trained as a theology teacher at King's College London (KCL) in Britain. Funding was secured from the International Missionary Council's Theological Education Fund (TEF), and the government agreed to give the Tutus permission to move to Britain.|$|E

25|$|Filming for Scream 3 {{began on}} July 6, 1999 {{in and around}} Hollywood, Los Angeles, {{in the areas of}} San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake, with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999. The {{isolated}} home of Campbell's character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA. A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from Scream was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven knew he wanted to revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set. Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage. The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily. So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> fate would be.|$|E

500|$|In short, {{a person}} could refuse to answer a {{question}} if that particular answer could incriminate them, e.g., a professional killer could decline to answer the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> or her occupation was.

500|$|Although the Bouffes-Parisiens {{played to}} full houses, the theatre was {{constantly}} {{on the verge of}} running out of money, principally because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> biographer Alexander Faris calls [...] "Offenbach's incorrigible extravagance as a manager". An earlier biographer, André Martinet, wrote, [...] "Jacques spent money without counting. Whole lengths of velvet were swallowed up in the auditorium; costumes devoured width after width of satin." [...] Moreover, Offenbach was personally generous and liberally hospitable. To boost the company's finances, a London season was organised in 1857, with half the company remaining in Paris to play at the Salle Choiseul and the other half performing at the St James's Theatre in the West End of London. The visit was a success, but did not cause the sensation that Offenbach's later works did in London.|$|E

500|$|In this series, the {{character}} of the Black Adder is somewhat different from later incarnations, being largely unintelligent, naive, and snivelling. The character does evolve through the series, however, and he begins showing signs <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> descendants will be like by the final episode, where he begins insulting everyone around him and making his own plans. This evolution follows naturally from {{the character}}'s situation. [...] "The Black Adder" [...] is the title that Edmund adopts during the first episode (after first considering [...] "The Black Vegetable"). Presumably one of his descendants adopted it as a surname before Blackadder II, in which the title character becomes [...] "Edmund Blackadder". [...] Furthermore, Baldrick is shown in more favourable and intelligent light here - his 'cunning plans' are typiclly superior and more workable than Edmund's own.

Toriyama stated he was influenced by animator Toyoo Ashida and the anime television series adaptation of his own Dragon Ball; from which he learned that separating colors instead of blending them makes the art cleaner and coloring illustrations easier.

500|$|After his Warner Bros. {{contract}} ended, Cooper formed his {{own production}} company, Baroda Productions, and made three unusual films in 1959 about redemption. In Delmer Daves' Western drama The Hanging Tree, Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob, and later tries to exploit his sordid past. Cooper delivered a [...] "powerful and persuasive" [...] performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is {{transformed by the}} love and sacrifice of a woman. In Robert Rossen's historical adventure They Came to Cordura with Rita Hayworth, he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916. While Cooper received positive reviews, Variety and Films in Review felt {{he was too old}} for the part. In Michael Anderson's action drama The Wreck of the Mary Deare with Charlton Heston, Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name. Like its two predecessors, the film was physically demanding. Cooper, who was a trained scuba diver, did most of his own underwater scenes. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles, Cooper effectively conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemption—what Joseph Conrad in Lord Jim called the [...] "struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> moral identity should be".|$|E
