40|$|Complaints {{about the}} {{treatment}} of businesswomen by the hotel sector are evident in both popular anecdote and the research literature. It is argued in this article that such dissatisfaction can be ill afforded in any service industry; furthermore, that the failure to address these complaints confounds the received direction within hotel management that argues for decentralized decision-making and customer orientation. Complementary surveys were conducted at the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> levels of selected UK-based hotel chains {{in order to test}} the hypothesis that the propensity of a hotel to answer the dissatisfactions of businesswomen {{is directly related to the}} extent of decentralized decision making and consumer orientation evident in the organization.

40|$|Aims and Objectives This review aims {{to explore}} {{effective}} mechanisms for listening to {{and learning from}} feedback from older people {{in the context of}} acute care. Background Maintaining the dignity of older people in acute care has become an issue of international concern. In the United Kingdom, recommendations for care improvement have {{led to the formation of}} an implementation group, the ‘Listening and Learning Hospitals Pilot Project’. This literature review forms phase 1 of the project. Design Realist synthesis was used to explore and synthesise wide-ranging evidence. Methods Using 12 databases, literature was scoped to propose four principles that underpin the context, mechanism and outcomes (CMO) of effective relation-based interventions with older people and their care partners in the acute care setting. A search was carried out in order to synthesise data to refute or support each principle. 137 studies and 11 sources of grey literature were appraised and included. A final synthesis of evidence across all principles identified key mechanisms for effective relation-based interventions. Results Eight essential mechanisms support effective care interventions. Conclusions This review adds depth and breadth to current nursing knowledge in this field through the process of realist synthesis. Acute care organisations need to make a commitment to supporting relational care at <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> levels. Additionally, they need to value and support the well-being of the nurses delivering it so that interventions to improve care for older people can succeed...|$|E

40|$|Research problem: The {{restructuring}} of an organisation {{can be classified}} as a transformational intervention (Litwin & Burke, 1992). As such is it has a potential to significantly influence key employee attitudes {{that are related to}} employee and organisational performance. Any deterioration in these attitudes could impact negatively on organisational outcomes. As part of the monitoring and review of change interventions, management needs to understand the change in employee attitudes towards their work and management in their business <b>units</b> <b>and</b> towards the broader organisation in order that, if necessary, corrective action can be taken. Research objectives: To address the research problem, research objectives and questions were established. The main objective {{of the study was to}} investigate whether there has been a change in attitudes of employees in two business units of a South African National Science Council after the implementation of restructuring in the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> the business <b>units.</b> The key attitudes to be measured are job and management satisfaction, perceived organisational support, organisational commitment and a dimension of employee engagement, dedication. Research questions: Four research questions were established and these were; What is the change in employee attitudes post-restructuring? In particular what is the change in employee job satisfaction; management satisfaction, employee engagement, commitment to the <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> perceived organisational support? What is the relationship between the sub-groups, distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service <b>and</b> business <b>unit,</b> <b>and</b> employee attitudes pre-restructuring? What is the relationship between the sub-groups distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service <b>and</b> business <b>unit,</b> <b>and</b> employee attitudes post-restructuring? What is the relationship between the sub-groups distinguished by gender, occupational level, race, home language, age, number of years of service <b>and</b> business <b>unit,</b> <b>and</b> the change in employee attitudes pre and post-restructuring? Research design: The nature of this research is descriptive. In order to solve the research questions the researcher used a pre-test and post-test measurement of employee attitudes.

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore and compare Finnish and British nursing students’ {{perceptions of their}} learning about patient safety in clinical settings. Background Patient safety culture and practices in different health care <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> clinical <b>units</b> varies, posing challenges for nursing students’ learning about patient safety during their clinical placements. Patient safety as a growing international concern has challenged health care professionals globally requiring a comprehensive review. International studies comparing nursing education about patient safety are lacking. Design A cross-sectional comparative study. Method The participants were final year preregistration nursing students from two universities of applied sciences in Finland (n = 195) and from two universities in England, UK (n = 158). The data were collected with the Patient Safety in Nursing Education Questionnaire and analysed with principal component analysis, Pearson Chi-Square and Mann–Whitney U tests and logistic regression. Results Finnish nursing students had significantly more critical perceptions on their learning about patient safety in clinical settings than their British peers. A strong predictor for differences was supportive and systems-based approaches in learning to ensure patient safety. Notably, fewer Finnish students had practiced reporting of incidents in clinical settings compared to British students. In both countries, the students held learning about patient safety in higher esteem compared to their learning experiences in clinical settings. Conclusions Nursing students appear to want more learning opportunities related to patient safety compared to the reality in clinical settings. Learning systematically from errors in a supportive environment and having systems-based approaches to ensure patient safety are essential elements for nursing students’ learning about safe practice. Finnish students seem to experience more barriers in learning about safe practices and to report errors than the British students.

40|$|Background: Academic {{clinical}} trials units have traditionally maintained their Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) {{on their own}} premises or those of their parent organisation (e. g. university). There is growing use, however, of 'SaaS' or 'Software as a Service' systems, in which the CDMS is hosted externally by another <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> access from the trials unit is web-based. ECRIN is supporting {{the development of a}} new CDMS ('Vista Trials') by EORTC, which will only offer a SaaS based deployment model. Because opinions vary widely about the suitability of the SaaS model, ECRIN felt it was important to clarify the acceptability of such a system to academic trials units. Methods: An online survey was created, using 'Survey Monkey', and sent to 129 academic trials units in Europe. After asking for brief details about the <b>unit</b> <b>and</b> existing systems, the survey asked how acceptable the proposed SaaS deployment method would be and why, and explored factors that would make the deployment more or less attractive. Results: 53 trials units responded from 14 countries (41. 1 %). The proposed SaaS deployment model was acceptable to 53 % of respondents, with smaller <b>units,</b> <b>and</b> those interested in changing their current system, relatively favourable to the model. Key factors appeared to be views on data security and data access but many others were mentioned. Some opinions were relatively dogmatic – 8 units claimed SaaS was essential for them whilst 11 rejected it as 'a matter of principle'. There also seemed some confusion about regulatory compliance of SaaS based systems: 44 % saw no problem, 19 % identified an issue and 37 % were not sure. Conclusions: The range of opinions expressed about SaaS implies a similar range in the assumptions units have about this type of deployment, e. g. about the security and access implications. Coupled with the uncertainties over compliance, this indicates a need for organisations like ECRIN to work with regulators, system vendors, hosting <b>organisations,</b> <b>and</b> trials <b>units</b> to clarify the risks and issues. This would inform the future development of the SaaS model for {{clinical trials}} systems, <b>and</b> help individual <b>units</b> make decisions about the best way of managing their CDMS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} Futures Studies methodology in {{the context}} of its implementation in organisational contexts. Today’s strategic landscape increasingly demands that <b>organisations</b> be flexible <b>and</b> prepared for change. But how do organisations prepare for change if the future is unpredictable? Foresight as a tool allows organisations to consider future options and the consequences of decisions in these future states. The rationale is even if organisations cannot plan for all contingencies, they will not be caught off-guard when change occurs, because they would have thought through the different options. Foresight activities now take place in a large number of medium to large private sector businesses and recently in government departments. These activities occur in {{the presence or absence of}} foresight units. The future of an organisation is the domain of its strategic planning, what then is the role of foresight <b>units</b> in <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> are they needed? In attempting to answer this query, this enquiry explored the activities of foresight in ten British public <b>and</b> private sector <b>organisations,</b> with <b>and</b> without foresight <b>units.</b> It suggests that the main role of foresight units is to embed foresight in organisations by attention to the quality of thinking processes in the organisation, creating an enabling culture and facilitating learning. Structures for co-ordination of foresight activities differ in <b>organisations</b> with <b>units</b> <b>and</b> those without, but there is no evidence to suggest that one approach is better than the other. There is evidence for the need for free-standing units of foresight, for organisations with limiting capacity in-house, but within organisations, the need for foresight units is debatable. This enquiry has contributed empirical evidence on the state of foresight in British <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> identified the immaturity of foresight practice in organisational settings...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} a novel objectives-oriented optimisation-based approach to effective {{planning and management}} {{of a set of}} decision alternatives implemented for achieving a hierarchy of objectives in a multi-level management or organisational structure. A new objectives-oriented evaluation model is developed based on a multiattribute decision making (MADM) technique to measure the relationship between different levels of objectives and to evaluate the decision alternatives in terms of their relative importance or contribution to higher-level organisation objectives. New optimisation-based models are developed for selecting, planning or assigning decision alternatives by maximising their total contribution to the organisation objectives. These methodological developments are applied to three application areas under various planning and management decision settings. In the application development for the strategic evaluation, planning, and selection of best practices, an objectives-oriented evaluation model is developed by integrating the MADM technique and the balanced scorecard framework. The evaluation model can be used to (a) prioritise a large set of best practices for achieving the higher-level <b>organisation</b> objectives <b>and</b> lower-level business <b>unit</b> objectives, (b) categorise best practices as strategic maps of implementation for the whole <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> individual business <b>units,</b> <b>and</b> (c) perform strategic planning of best practices from multiple perspectives of an organisation in a balanced manner. An optimisation-based selection model is developed to select a minimum set of best practices for meeting the goal-achievement requirements specified for each <b>organisation</b> objective <b>and</b> for each business unit. In the application development for the management of implementing critical success factors (CSFs) for ERP projects, an objectives-oriented evaluation model is developed to (a) measure the relationship between objectives of a three-level hierarchy, and (b) evaluate the contribution of the CSFs to the organisation objectives. Three optimisation-based planning models are developed to (a) obtain a set of optimal implementation weights for CSFs by maximising the total implementation benefit of the <b>organisation,</b> <b>and</b> (b) set an overall management priority of the CSFs for the whole organisation by considering the varying management preferences of the individual departments. In the application development for project assignment and performance evaluation, an objective-oriented preference-based assignment process with an optimisation model are developed to (a) assign a project to a project manager who is expected to perform best and contribute most to the <b>organisation</b> objectives, <b>and</b> (b) maximise the total weighted contribution value of all projects to the organisation objectives by incorporating the projects’ expected contribution and the project managers’ expected performance. The efficiency-based evaluation process with two data envelopment analysis models are developed to (a) measure the relative performance efficiency of completed projects and of project managers based on their expected and actual performances, (b) provide relative performance efficiency rankings of projects and of project managers, and (c) identify how inefficient projects and project managers can be improved. With the development of the objectives-oriented optimisation-based approach and three application areas, this study makes significant conceptual and methodological contributions. The objectives-oriented evaluation model provides a formal methodology for measuring the relationship between objectives in a multi-level hierarchy. This objectives-oriented evaluation facilitates objectives focused business planning and management. The optimisation-based planning model provides a novel methodology for maximising the total contribution of decision alternatives by integrating management preferences of an <b>organisation</b> <b>and</b> its business <b>units.</b> This optimisation-based planning enables effective implementation management of decision alternatives at all management levels of an organisation. In managing assignment and performance evaluation of projects, the performance-based approach represents a novel conceptual and methodological framework. This framework provides project-based organisations with a proactive and transparent mechanism for managing the assignment and performance evaluation of projects and project managers. The objectives-oriented optimisation-based approach has general application for a multi-level hierarchy of objectives under any organisational settings. It is applicable for planning and managing a given set of business processes or activities under various decision contexts...|$|R
