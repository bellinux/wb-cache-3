Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying [...] "Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. They get it first before we get it?", referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. [...] "The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field," [...] according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn. [...] "He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could," [...] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. [...] "The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government," [...] the Chicago Tribune editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, {{in spite of the fact}} that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.|$|E
