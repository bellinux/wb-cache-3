5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity</b> (later human rights).|$|E

In order to achieve global justice, eight minimum criteria must be met. These are 1) dialogue, 2) effective and representative multilateral institutions, 3) representative decision-making structures, 4) fair treatment, 5) empathy, 6) accountability, 7) transparency, and 8) adherence to international law.|$|E
25|$|United Nations: Fundamentally, {{poverty is}} the {{inability}} of having choices and opportunities, a violation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity.</b> It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.|$|E
25|$|International groups {{attempted}} {{to pressure the}} IOC to reject Beijing's bid in protest {{of the state of}} human rights in the People's Republic of China. One Chinese dissident who expressed similar sentiments was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for calling on the IOC to do just {{that at the same time}} that IOC inspectors were touring the city. Amnesty International expressed concern in 2006 regarding the Olympic Games to be held in China in 2008, likewise expressing concerns over the human rights situation. The second principle in the Fundamental Principles of Olympism, Olympic Charter states that The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity.</b> Amnesty International considers the policies and practices of the People's Republic as failing to meet that principle, and urged the IOC to press China to immediately enact human rights reform.|$|E

500|$|For Kenyatta, {{independence}} meant {{not just}} self-rule, but {{an end to}} the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's [...] "basic philosophy" [...] throughout his life was that [...] "all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that [...] "I have stood always for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity</b> in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace."

500|$|Charles J.

[...] Atticus' lesson to Scout that [...] "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it" [...] exemplifies his compassion. [...] She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. [...] When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. [...] Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. [...] One writer remarks, [...] "...hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [...] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings." ...|$|E
500|$|Treasury {{officials}} officially recommended Gasparro's design, {{which they}} {{referred to as a}} [...] "modernized version of the classic Liberty design". On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's William Proxmire introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty. On May 15, Representatives Mary Rose Oakar and Patricia Schroeder introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives. Anthony was also recommended by members of the National Organization for Women, the Congresswomen's Caucus, the National Women's Political Caucus and the League of Women Voters. In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to Walter E. Fauntroy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: The League believes that the time has come, and is indeed long past, for the likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness should be that of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity</b> in this nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure. In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support.|$|E

2500|$|Defecating in {{the open}} is a very ancient practice. In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less {{population}} pressure on land. It was believed that defecating {{in the open}} causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important public health issue, and an issue <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>dignity.</b> [...] With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health. As a result, {{there was an increase}} in global attention towards reducing the practice of open defecation.|$|E

50|$|The primogeniture rule {{as applied}} to the {{customary}} law of succession could not be reconciled with the current notions <b>of</b> equality and <b>human</b> <b>dignity</b> as contained in the Bill of Rights.

In denying extra-marital children the right to inherit from their deceased fathers, it also discriminated unfairly against them and infringed their right to dignity as well. The result was that the limitation it imposed on the rights of those subject to it was not reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society founded on the values <b>of</b> equality, <b>human</b> <b>dignity</b> and freedom.|$|R
