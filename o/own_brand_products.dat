40|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} {{pharmaceuticals}} markets is that sellers of branded drugs will, sometimes, sell generic versions of their <b>own</b> <b>branded</b> <b>products,</b> {{either directly or}} through license agreements.

In a model that combines horizontal and vertical product di¤erentiation, we show that the producer of the <b>branded</b> <b>product</b> will not sell the pseudo-generic unless faced with competition and that, if she does so, in some circumstances, all prices raise to the bene t of all competitors and the detriment of consumers. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
