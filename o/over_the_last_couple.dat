25|$|The Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston, a {{combined}} statistical area, has had {{glimpses of the}} religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of religionists {{at the turn of}} the century. Early newspaper accounts of events were followed by papers on the precursor Bábí religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion. The community began to coalesce being near to Green Acre, founded by Sarah Farmer, who publicly espoused the religion from 1901. From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Bahá'ís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913. Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days. Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion. In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as Urbain Ledoux, James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., Nancy Bowditch, and Guy Murchie. The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion. Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Bahá'ís themselves. Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation. The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children’s classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion.|$|E

The path to the commercialization of this hybrid CSP product goes through the scaling of the solarized gas turbine capacity and the increase of the receiver outlet temperature. The Soltrec project focuses on the development, manufacturing and testing of a volumetric receiver, capable to raise the maximum temperature of the compressed air up to 1000 °C. The concept of volumetric air receivers is the most promising option for getting high efficiencies at these temperature levels, with solar shares of up to 80 % at design point operation. Transforming solar radiation into hot pressurized air at these temperatures levels leads to thermal and mechanical stresses that requires an innovate receiver design and the application of new heat resistant materials. With the objective of significantly increasing the solar share and lower the costs and environmental impact of the hybrid plants the pilot Soltrec air receiver has been commissioned at the Abengoa Solar R&D facilities at Sanlúcar la Mayor (Seville, Spain) ...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic cod is an {{important}} species for food production in Norway, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couples</b> of decades; Atlantic cod farming has gradually evolved as an industry in Norway. The harvesting procedures of farmed fish have gained major attention both in the aquaculture industry, research institutions and various organizations dealing with animal welfare issues. According to the legislations, the fish must be stunned before or {{at the same time}} as they are killed and remain unconscious until death supervenes. Adequate handling practices, methods of killing, and equipment are therefore needed. The overall aim of this study was to propose a ‘best practice’ processing line for stunned, bled, gutted, and chilled farmed Atlantic cod, which allows for good fish welfare, low handling stress, efficient bleeding, effective chilling, and maintenance of the intrinsic product quality as produced by farming. Different stunning and killing methods were tested: electrical stunning, AQUI-S TM anaesthesia, percussion stunning and carbon dioxide sedation with or without live chilling. Fish welfare and stress response of Atlantic cod exposed to the different stunning/killing methods were studied. Fish quality was assessed post rigor to assess possible connection between stunning methods and quality of the product. According to the EEG and ECG measurements, both AQUI-S TM anaesthesia (68 ml/l,) or euthanasia, electrical stunning in seawater (170 Hz 33 % duty cycle) and electrical stunning in air (107 Vrms for 15 sec) proved to be efficient stunning methods for cod. The fish can be rendered unconscious for a prolonged period of time. Doses of > 30 ml/l AQUI-S TM should be used for batchwise stunning of cod. Live chilling without an anaesthetic cannot be used as a sedation method for Atlantic cod. Furthermore, live chilling in seawater slurry cannot be recommended, since strong aversive reactions occurred immediately after transfer to the chilling tank. Carbon dioxide sedation at medium levels (245 - 284 mg/l) might be applicable as a potential sedation method for cod. At lower carbon dioxide levels (63 - 80 mg/l), adequate sedation was not achieved. Carbon dioxide sedation at high levels (330 - 550 mg/l) might be applicable, but further research is needed. However, carbon dioxide sedation at very high levels (400 - 1400 mg/l) the welfare of the fish seemed to be compromised. Percussion stunning proved to be a good killing (stunning) method based on handling stress assessments. Based on the quality assessments either of the bleeding methods, gill cutting and direct gutting, can be successfully applied for Atlantic cod. Despite the fact that pre-rigor filleting has several advantages like increased freshness and lower transportation costs, pre-rigor processing also presents problems. As seen in this study fillets cut post rigor were superior to fillets cut pre rigor in terms of various quality properties such as fillet colour, water content, water holding capacity. The shape of pre-rigor processed fillets was different from traditional post-rigor fillets. In terms of chilling efficiency, live-chilling of cod is as effective as traditional chilling using flake ice after gutting. The results do not indicate better freshness of superchilled cod (gutted or filleted) compared to cod stored in ice after 7 days. However, after 14 days of storage the potential advantages of superchilling of gutted cod became more prominent with lower microbiological activity, better maintenance of freshness compared with traditional ice stored cod. Assessments of fish welfare are difficult, and the only reliable assessments were ECG and EEG measurements, but these measurements are not applicable in the industry. Fish behaviour and assessments of Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) might be usable, but needs to be used with caution. Obtaining relevant blood parameters and interpretation of these related to both fish welfare and stress at the time of harvest can be complicated. Our results consistently showed that perimortem handling stress did not cause inferior flesh quality, and indicates that farmed cod can be processed with little risk of reducing product quality. This study has shown that Atlantic cod is not easily excitable, and is more resistant to handling stress than several other fish species. However, this fact should not neglect attention to handling practices since gentle handling is a pre-requisite for adequate fish welfare. Based on the results from this thesis a processing line for farmed Atlantic cod is suggested and presented in the thesis PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R

I consider both plasmonic nanoparticles, and also high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles that support Mie-type electric and magnetic dipole resonances. Specific outcomes {{of this study are}} listed as follows. (i) A new model is presented for optical Fano resonances, which is based on interference between nonorthogonal eigenmodes of the associated scattering object. This is demonstrated to correctly describe Fano resonances in both plasmonic and high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticle oligomers. (ii) Polarisation-independent scattering and absorption losses are shown to be enforced by n-fold discrete rotational symmetry, Cn (n ≥ 3), and the reciprocal degeneracy of eigenmodes. (iii) A form of circular dichroism that emerges from interaction of nonorthogonal resonances is presented, and specifically impacts the ratio of radiative scattering loss to dissipative absorption loss experienced by reciprocal plane waves. The sequence of general theoretical conclusions (i) -(iii) serve to build the understanding of optical scattering from nanoparticle systems while removing existing ambiguities.

40|$|There {{is growing}} concern {{within the public}} health {{community}} that the rapid decline of new antibiotics <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two decades, <b>coupled</b> with the adaptive nature of bacterial infections, could lead to widespread disease without effective treatments. It is difficult for pharmaceutical companies to recoup {{the billions of dollars}} invested in the research and development (R&D) of new antibiotics because bacterial infections are treated with older antibiotics first and for short dosage periods to stymie antibiotic resistance. Without a means to recoup their R&D costs and enduring shareholder demands for profit-maximizing endeavors, many companies shut down their antibiotics labs in favor of more profitable medications, like those for chronic illnesses that require continual administration for extended periods. In an effort to stimulate more antibiotic R&D, the United States passed the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act in 2012 to motivate companies to bring more antibiotic treatments to market. This paper aims to explain the supply and demand problems of the current market for antibiotics and analyze GAIN’s impact on R&D investment. After examining the amount of antibiotics in clinical trials before and after the GAIN Act, there was insufficient statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that GAIN altered the behavior of companies. This Act does not offer enough incentives to counteract the unique market anomaly antibiotics present. Without a continual robust antibiotic pipeline, bacterial infections, including new strains of antibiotic-resistant infections, will be untreatable. This study has public health significance because highlights the urgent nature of providing additional incentives to companies that invest in antibiotics R&D, without which, there will be few options to treat bacterial infections in the future...|$|R
40|$|Cardiometabolic {{diseases}} have substantially {{increased in}} China {{in the past}} 20 years and blood pressure is a primary modifiable risk factor. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we examine blood pressure trends in China from 1991 to 2009, with a concentration on age cohorts and urbanicity. Very large values of blood pressure are of interest, so we model the conditional quantile functions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This allows the covariate effects {{in the middle of}} the distribution to vary from those in the upper tail, the focal point of our analysis. We join the distribu-tions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a copula, which permits the relationships between the covariates and the two responses to share in-formation and enables probabilistic statements about systolic and diastolic blood pressure jointly. Our copula maintains the marginal distributions of the group quantile effects while accounting for within-subject dependence, en-abling inference at the population and subject levels. Our population-level regression effects change across quantile level, year and blood pressure type, providing a rich environment for inference. To our knowledge, this is the first quantile function model to explicitly model within-subject autocorrela-tion and is the first quantile function approach that simultaneously models multivariate conditional response. We find that the association between high blood pressure and living in an urban area has evolved from positive to neg-ative, with the strongest changes occurring in the upper tail. The increase in urbanization <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twenty years <b>coupled</b> with the transition from the positive association between urbanization and blood pressure in earlier years to a more uniform association with urbanization suggests increasing blood pressure over time throughout China, even in less urbanized areas.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{continuous}} process that began centuries ago. Today {{the pace of change}} has increased with greater rapidity because of global warming induced by anthropogenically generated greenhouse gases (GHG). Failure to effectively deal with the adverse outcomes can easily disrupt plans for sustainable economic development. Because of the failure of export agriculture <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> several decades, to provide the economic stimuli needed to promote economic growth and development, Jamaica, like many other island states in the Caribbean subregion, has come to rely on tourism as an instrument of transformation of the macro-economy. It is believed this shift in economic imperative would eventually provide the economic impetus needed to generate much needed growth and development. This assessment has shown that tourism is not only a leading earner of foreign exchange in Jamaica and a major creator of both direct and indirect jobs but, also, one of the principal contributors to the country‟s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The rapid expansion of the industry which occurred <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> several decades <b>coupled</b> with disregard for sound environmental practices has led to the destruction of coral reefs and the silting of wetlands. Because most of the industry is located along the coastal region it is extremely vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Failure to address the predictable environmental challenges of climate change, with some degree of immediacy, will not only undermine, but quickly and seriously impair the capacity of industry to stimulate and contribute to the process of economic development. To this end, it important that further development of industry be characterised by sound economic and social planning and proper environmental practices [...] I. Introduction. [...] II.

40|$|Today, current drug {{discovery}} and lead generation efforts focus on high throughput screening of large chemical libraries {{as the primary}} source of lead candidates. A lack of investment in novel chemotype development by pharmaceutical companies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 15 years <b>coupled</b> with the concurrent merger of screening collections and the availability of generic compound libraries commercially have resulted in many discovery efforts that lack uniqueness and do not offer a strong patent position to operate. The need for better, more diverse, and more drug-like libraries is essential in order to feed high throughput screening efforts with molecules that probe new dimensions of chemical space and allow for the discovery of untapped intellectual property. This dissertation details a complete structure based study to design novel inhibitors of B-Raf and p 38 a MAP Kinase. A structural evaluation of the important and similar interactions necessary for DFG-out allosteric inhibitors to bind their respective targets was accomplished through the synthesis and evaluation of three known allosteric kinase inhibitors, GleevecÂ®, NexavarÂ®, and BIRB- 796, and 8 additional DFG-out allosteric inhibitors that were developed directly from fragments of these successful scaffolds. The structural insight that was gained from the evaluation of known DFG-out allosteric inhibitors was then utilized to design novel inhibitors that incorporated two unique scaffolds based on two new [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. A pyrrolo- 3, 4 -dicarboximide scaffold has been developed through the utilization of a novel tandem [3 + 2] cycloaddition then elimination reaction scheme. This scaffold, which contains three sites for variation, was then rationally incorporated into lead molecules using structure-based methods and in silico feedback for the production of dual DFG-out allosteric kinase inhibitors of p 38 a and B-Raf kinase. These inhibitors display micromolar to submicromolar enzymatic IC 50 's for both p 38 a and B-Raf kinase and low micromolar inhibition of cell growth in 4 separate cancer cell lines. We also explored new chemistry that utilizes a key one pot, [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction to obtain highly substituted imidazoles and their application in the design of specific allosteric B-Raf inhibitors. Inhibitors based on this scaffold display subnanomolar potency and a favorable kinase profile...|$|R
40|$|In Western Europe the {{incidence}} of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has increased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 30 years, <b>coupled</b> with changes in distribution. Modifications in the TBE enzootic cycle, {{through a combination of}} changes in temperature, vertebrate abundance and habitat suitability may have increased the risk of TBE in recent years. In Switzerland, analysis using satellite-derived climate data demonstrated that the environment of areas with TBE since the 1980 s and areas that recently became endemic for TBE have become more similar between 2001 and 2009. This was coupled with an increase in April, May and June temperature, which could have affected the tick population and/or human exposure to ticks. Deer and boar abundance also changed in some cantons. In Germany, spatio-temporal modelling demonstrated the importance of temperature, vertebrate abundance and unemployment in {{the incidence}} and distribution of TBE between 2001 and 2009. Changes in TBE reporting, April, May and June temperature, vertebrate abundance and pesticide use may have contributed to increases in TBE in 1992 and 2001. Human exposure patterns, however, appear to be as important as the enzootic cycle in shaping {{the incidence of}} TBE, not only in determining the overall trend but also in interacting with the weekly, seasonal and yearly patterns of tick hazard to give the observed incidence. In Switzerland, in weeks with warm, sunny weather, human exposure to ticks is promoted and short-term increases in tick bites are seen. Human outdoor activity also shifts the seasonal pattern of tick bites, when compared with tick questing. There was no apparent increase in time spent in outdoor activities between the 1990 s and 2000 s in Italy, Germany and Austria, but survey data demonstrated that walking and hiking were already popular activities across Europe by the 1990 s. The popularity of mushroom and berry foraging as a source of income in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, coupled with the expense of vaccination, provide an inverse link between economic wellbeing and TBE risk. Correspondingly, in 2009, the economic recession was associated with an increase with TBE in these three countries. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
