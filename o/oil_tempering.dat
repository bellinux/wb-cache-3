40|$|Polymer matrix {{compounds}} {{based on}} piezo ceramic and electrically conducting particles within a thermoplastic matrix show distinctive piezoelectric and dielectric effects which can used for sensor applications. The electrical and mechanical properties {{can be adjusted}} {{in a wide range}} by varying the ratio of active filling particles and the matrix materials. The sensor effect of the compound is generated by the ceramic particles. A large ratio of piezo ceramic powder facilitates a high sensitivity. The electrical permittivity of the otherwise insulating matrix polymer can be adjusted by the amount of conductive filler. An aligned permittivity leads to a stronger electrical field in the ceramic particles. In contrast, too many conductive particles create a conductive network in the compound which short-circuits the sensors. The piezo ceramic compounds can be processed via micro injection molding for application as ceramic sensors. This offers a wide range of new sensor design variants, notably three-dimensional and highly complex geometries. However, there are two main demands for a highly sensitive sensor, which are conflicting. On the one hand the filler content of piezo ceramic particles in combination with electrical conductive carbon nanotubes must be very high; on the other hand the wall thickness should be as thin as possible. For filling cavities with a high aspect-ratio in an injection molding process, low viscosity polymer melts are necessary. These process characteristics conflict with the increasing viscosity by filling the melt with the particles. The sensor measuring area has to be designed as thin walled as possible. In order to overcome this obstacle a dynamically tempered mold design is applied to avoid solidification of the melt, before the mold is completely filled. The mold can be tempered by Peltier elements. The fully electric tempering is cleaner, more precise and more reliable than conventional water or <b>oil</b> <b>tempering...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SAE 8620 {{steel is}} {{typically}} {{used in the}} carburized condition for powertrain applications in the automotive industry, e. g. gears, roller bearings, camshafts.

The intent {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of heat treatment parameters on the amount of retained austenite, residual stress and distortion in carburized SAE 8620 steel. A specially designed specimen, the Navy C-ring, was used for this study. The steel was first normalized prior to machining the Navy C-ring specimens. The specimens were then heat treated by carburizing at 927 °C or 954 °C (1700 °F or 1750 °F) at four levels of carbon potential (0. 9, 1. 0, 1. 1, 1. 2) followed by <b>oil</b> quenching and <b>tempering</b> at either 149 °C or 177 °C (300 °F or 350 °F).

Tempering temperatures of 150, 250, 350, 450 and 550 °C were employed. In addition, a partial decarburisation was promoted in the samples prior to the quenching and tempering, this in order to modify the local martensite start temperature and promote the martensite transformation to take place at a higher temperature, while reducing the amount of retained austenite.

But generally speaking, cast iron is weak and brittle by the existance of flake graphite in it. 　In this paper, applying quench-tempering to a pearlitic cast iron, the structual changes caused in it were first observed by an optical microscope. And the changes of tensile strength and hardness by quench-tempering were examined. Then aspects of fracturing of the quench-tempered cast iron were precisely investigated in bending, tension and rotating bending fatigue fracture,and the mechanism of improving mechanical properties by such heat treatment was considered. And following results were obtained:　(1) Heated at 900 ℃ for more 1 hour, flake graphites grow remarkably and simultaneously their edges grow round and their surface smoothes. Even if the heating time at the quenching temperature becomes longer, noticeable change can not be found in the matrix among large flake graphites. A thin layer of ferrite wraps each graphite. 　(2) The highest tensile strength is obtained by heating at 900 ℃ for 3 hours, <b>oil</b> quenching, and <b>tempering</b> at 400 - 500 ℃. The specimen treated above is 1. 45 times strong as the material as cast.

But when subjected to the repeated stress, the propagation of crack is affected by the structure of matrix rather than graphite...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: AISI H 11 is {{a special}} alloy steel, {{categorized}} as chromium tool steel.

Current work reports and analyzes results of mechanical testing performed on variously heat treated H 11 steel samples, to arrive at an optimum heat treatment strategy for hot work applications. Design/methodology/approach: Tensile and impact test specimens were fabricated using precision milling and EDM. These samples were subjected to various heat treatment sequences, consisting of annealing, hardening, air and <b>oil</b> quenching, and <b>tempering</b> at different temperatures. Heat treated samples were then mechanically tested for hardness (Rockwell), impact toughness (Charpy), and tensile properties (yield strength, ultimate strength, ductility). Findings: Mechanical testing of H 11 samples revealed that with increasing temper temperatures: (a) hardness first increases to a maximum and then gradually decreases; (b) impact toughness first decreases to a minimum and then increases; (c) yield strength first decreases, then increases, and then increases again; (d) ultimate strength first increases to a maximum and then steadily decreases; and (e) ductility (% elongation) gradually decreases till 600 ºC, and then increases rather sharply. Practical implications: Though a very promising candidate for hot-work applications, H 11 steel is not commonly used for die and tool making.

40|$|To reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and <b>temper</b> <b>oil</b> dependence in the transportation sector, solutions such as electric vehicles (EVs) and car sharing have been proposed and promoted. EV sharing, {{the combination of these}} technological and operational solutions, aims to overcome hurdles in the way toward mass EV adoption by allowing customers to use EVs without owning them. Several companies, such as Car 2 Go (a subsidiary of Daimler AG) and Autolib are providing car sharing services with full EV fleets in cities such as San Diego and Paris. A key feature that differentiates these novel service systems from conventional car sharing systems (e. g., Zipcar) is that they allow one-way trips, {{and in the case of}} Car 2 Go, free street parking. With added flexibility, these systems opens up the possibility to meet a larger range of travel needs and show potential to revolutionize urban transportation. In this paper, we study the service region design problem for service provider such as Car 2 Go. Due to the one-way nature of service, customer adoption of the service critically depends on service coverage, i. e., whether or not their preferred destinations are covered. From the service provider's perspective, the service region has to be designed strategically under uncertainty of customer travel patterns and preferences. We propose a model that supports service region design with fleet sizing decisions to maximize expected profit, based on a distributionally-robust optimization framework to tackle the inherent planning uncertainties. We show that the problem can be transformed into a computationally-tractable mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP). Using this model and real operational data of Car 2 Go in San Diego, we perform a case study to address various design questions. Our results identify greater profit and higher EV utilization opportunities under properly selected service region and fleet size. It is also shown that EV sharing systems bring more environmental benefits, e. g., savings in carbon emissions, than replacing personal gasoline cars with EV ownership. Furthermore, smaller regional variations in demographics, e. g., population and income levels, lead to more spread service region. Our results also suggest that charging technology advances help to reduce the fleet size and expand the service region while the marginal impacts on service region design is diminishing.
