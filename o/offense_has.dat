25|$|The offense {{continued}} {{against the}} Rockies on May 30, when James Loney {{hit a home}} run and Ethier was 2 for 4 with 3 RBI in the 7-1 win. Matt Kemp and Casey Blake both homered in the Dodgers 8-2 win as the team closed out the month of May with a three-game winning streak, where the <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> been unusually productive.|$|E
25|$|Before the apprehension, {{a secret}} search was {{conducted}} in the person's house. One precondition for such a procedure is the <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> a punishment limit of more than 10 years. Because the Norwegian criminal code equates oral sex and intercourse, the case has a punishment limit of 21 years, and hence the police were able to conduct a secret search.|$|E
25|$|The Monday {{night game}} versus Valparaiso of the Horizon League {{goes into the}} books as a {{scoreless}} draw, but SIUE was thoroughly outplayed by the Crusaders. The Cougars' passing was frequently careless, and the team as a whole, seemed reluctant to shoot the ball. After having a man sent off in the 60th minute and playing a man short for 50 minutes, Valpo still outshot the home team 14–9, even with the Cougars taking seven corner kicks. After three exhibition games and two double-overtime games, the SIUE <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> managed only one goal (the PK in the NIU game was scored by a defender).|$|E

2500|$|The team {{is known}} for the Princeton offense perfected under the tenure of former head coach Pete Carril who coached the team from 1967 to 1996. [...] The Princeton <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> {{resulted}} in Princeton leading the nation in scoring defense 20 times since 1976 including every year from 1989 to 2000. [...] The Tigers entered the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season with 1,552 career victories (which ranked 23rd among the 347 NCAA Division I programs), 24 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament appearances (including four consecutive appearances between 1989 and 1992), and 5 National Invitation Tournament appearances.|$|E
2500|$|In American football, a team {{is allowed}} four {{attempts}} or [...] "downs" [...] {{to move the}} ball [...] towards the goal line. If the offense moves ten yards in four attempts or fewer, it gains a [...] "first down," [...] which restarts the process. If, after four attempts, the <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> neither scored nor gained ten yards, the other team is given possession of the ball. Under normal circumstances (for example, excluding penalties which can involve replaying a down), no team {{is supposed to be}} allowed five attempts. In this game, due to an officiating error, Colorado was given a fifth consecutive down which they used to score the game-winning touchdown as time expired.|$|E

A voice [...] "from this very spot" [...] forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, {{and seemed to be}} showing off. Socrates states that he is a [...] "seer". While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him. Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> nothing to do with low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the game clock, a separate play clock is also used. This counts down the time the <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> to start the next play before it is assessed a penalty for delay of game (see below). This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play. The NFL and NCAA use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the <b>offense</b> <b>has</b> 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready.
