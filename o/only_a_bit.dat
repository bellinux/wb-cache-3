5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{at least}} half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and {{sometimes}} young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Japan near Sapporo, nests {{are covered}} with snow until early April. About 2 weeks later, the single founding queen arrives to start the nest, falling {{under the category of}} haplometrotic foundation. The first worker in the nest emerges in early July, and all emerge within a couple of days. The workers are produced by eggs that were laid {{at the beginning of the}} nest formation. The incubation period is about 60 days for a worker. P. snelleni only has 5-15 workers in a single nest, proving to be one of the smallest in Japan. Males in P. snelleni emerge after workers, during a period of 1–2 weeks, in cells that are separated from those that produce workers. There are about 10-20 males in an average nest, which is <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more than the amount of workers. Young queens (about 30-50) also come about during this time, in late July, in northern Japan. In central Japan, the young queens come about a month later in the middle of August. Reproductive females mate during the nesting season. These young queens are particularly aggressive. It sometimes happens that there are dwarf queens that arise in the nest, that look vaguely like workers. These emerge in late August when only a few workers remain in the nest and the food supplies have dwindled. These dwarf queens have a low chance of mating because most of the males have died. Eggs and larvae disappear in middle and later August respectively.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{believed}} {{it was a bad}} idea for his character to get involved with a work colleague. Oliver began to doubt the relationship, and on Penny's advice, convinced Chrissie to break up with him without ruining his career. Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as [...] "it was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of fun. She never planned on settling down with him." [...] It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not think that she was capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to [...] "stand up to the mark and be a proper man". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.|$|E

Vulcans {{frequently}} visited the United States during the 1960s and 1970s to participate in air shows and static displays, {{as well as to}} participate in the Strategic Air Command's Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition at such locations as Barksdale AFB, Louisiana and the former McCoy AFB, Florida, with the RAF crews representing Bomber Command and later Strike Command. Vulcans also took part in the 1960, 1961, and 1962 Operation Skyshield exercises, in which NORAD defences were tested against possible Soviet air attack, the Vulcans simulating Soviet fighter/bomber attacks against New York, Chicago and Washington. The results of the tests were classified until 1997. The Vulcan proved quite successful during the 1974 [...] "Giant Voice" [...] exercise, in which it managed to avoid USAF interceptors.|$|E

500|$|The 2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season was {{historically}} {{busy for}} the Tampa Bay area. The region {{was affected by}} a record four hurricanes that year; Frances, Jeanne, Charley, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Ivan. [...] Jeanne and Frances passed over Tampa as tropical storms after making their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south-southwest, which would have been the worst-case scenario for local storm surge flooding. But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to the region, devastating the Ft. Myers/Port Charlotte area instead. [...] Ivan also threatened the area as it moved north up the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It remained far to the west of central Florida, however, and brought <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of rain and wind to Tampa Bay before eventually slamming into coastal Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.|$|E
500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more of a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together {{with a bit of}} character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E

50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} variants that support R2 {{line signalling}} in its digital form via the A, B, C, and D bits in DS0 channel #16 of an E1 {{fall into two}} general categories: those that use <b>only</b> the <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> to represent each signal and those that use multiple A, B, C, and D bits to represent each signal, with using <b>only</b> two, the <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> and the B bit being {{by far the most}} common. Those that use <b>only</b> the <b>A</b> <b>bit,</b> strongly resemble the analog electrical R2 line signalling, where each signal is a timed pulse that differs by length of time that the pulse is in the high voltage (i.e., one-valued bit) state before returning to the untimed resting voltage state (i.e., zero-valued bit). Those that use multiple bits to represent each signal usually are stateful in that time of exhibition of that bit pattern typically plays no role in conveying meaning.|$|R

2500|$|David Russell Hulme {{provides}} {{further evidence}} that the music of The Zoo, or {{at least part of}} it, was already in existence before Trial by Jury opened. [...] He notes that Sullivan's sketch manuscript for Trial contains the first sixteen bars of a solo for the Usher that was deleted before the opera's premiere, called [...] "His Lordship's always quits". [...] Aside from a key change, it is the same tune that Sullivan would use for Carboy's aria in The Zoo, [...] "I loved her fondly." [...] But because Sullivan entered <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the tune in his sketch, Hulme concluded that the composer [...] "needed only a few notes to remind him of his intentions.

2500|$|Funk {{musician}} George Clinton {{was hired}} to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley (1985). The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly.

It received <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more attention than The Red Hot Chili Peppers with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end. Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.

What Is This? had finally disbanded, and drummer Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves.|$|E
