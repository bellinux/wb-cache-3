30|$|The time {{complexity}} of DE can be evaluated {{according to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> which is a common metric of optimization.

In this research, we set the maximum number of generation as 100 and population size as 400; therefore, the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> is 40, 000. We observed that all DE variants reach the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> for each experiment on average. Even so, according to the results mentioned above, the proposed attack can produce effective solutions in such a small number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations.</b>|$|R

30|$|In our IEC model, {{the upper}} limit on the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> is pre-specified (e.g., 200 in our {{computational}} experiments). An important requirement in our IEC model {{is that the best}} solution among the examined ones should be identified after the pre-specified number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> without any additional re-evaluations. Let us assume that {{the upper limit}} on the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> is seven in the above-mentioned example. The best solution x^D was identified after six evaluations in the order of x^Ax^Bx^Cx^Dx^Ex^A. Since the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> is six and its upper limit is seven, we can evaluate one more solution x^F in comparison with the previously evaluated solution x^A. If the evaluation result is x^F≺x^A, we can say that x^D is the best solution among the examined six solutions. If the evaluation result is x^A≺x^F, we cannot say which is better between x^D and x^F. In order to identify the best solution between them, we need to re-evaluate x^D after the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> x^F. However, we cannot perform this re-evaluation since the given upper limit on the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> is seven. This means that we cannot identify the best solution among the examined six solutions when the evaluation result is x^A≺x^F. In order to satisfy both requirements (i.e., the upper limit on the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> and the identification of the best solutions among the examined ones), we have to terminate the search after the sixth evaluation in the order of x^Ax^Bx^Cx^Dx^Ex^A. This example suggests the necessity of early termination before the total number <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> reaches the upper limit.|$|R
