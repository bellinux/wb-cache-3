500|$|The {{improved}} {{results of}} the 1990s prompted higher expectations from the Australian Winter Olympic hierarchy. At {{the start of the}} 2002 Olympics, the Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman addressed the team, saying [...] "historically our winter teams have been the child racked by self-doubt, shy in nature as we saw <b>our</b> <b>big</b> brother, our summer Games team, take on and conquer the world." [...] He added, [...] "but over time we have developed a belief in ourselves".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{producer}} Daniel Melnick, whose Altered States was moved up a month into the 1980 Christmas season by the studio over his objections, complained {{about this in}} an interview. [...] "I would rather go {{at a time when}} there are fewer people attending movies and offer them pictures they want to see, rather than to divide a larger audience with ten other desirable films ... s an industry we have very often shown the instinct of lemmings ... We're all convinced that people go to the movies primarily at Christmas time, so we release <b>our</b> <b>big</b> pictures then ..." ...|$|E
500|$|McHale {{wrote the}} series' first episode, {{and served as}} the show's lead writer. His 2006 {{promotion}} to executive producer {{was part of a}} bid by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke to [...] "put writers back {{at the heart of the}} process". Yorke called McHale's promotion [...] "fantastic", explaining: [...] "It means that for the first time you've got a writer running one of <b>our</b> <b>big</b> powerhouse BBC1 shows." [...] Following McHale's resignation, his replacement as lead writer was Justin Young, who intends to introduce a more writer-led commissioning process from series 13 onwards, with writers creating more of the theme and story of their episodes than was previously the case.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} episode, Nickelodeon {{launched}} an on-air campaign called [...] "SpongeBob's Lost Episode", which culminated with {{the premiere of}} [...] "The Sponge Who Could Fly". Nickelodeon also partnered with Burger King to release a line of toys as a marketing tie-in to the event. The toy line consisted of eight figures, including SpongeBob Silly Squirter, Swing Time Patrick, Jellyfish Fields, Plankton Bubble Up, Squirt N' Whistle Squidward, Plush Shakin' SpongeBob, Karate Chop Sandy and Gravity Defying Gary. The promotion ran for five weeks, during which time one of the popular items on the [...] "Big Kids" [...] menu, Chicken Tender, came [...] "in fun star and lightning bolt shapes." [...] Craig Braasch, vice president of global advertising and promotions for the Burger King Corporation, said [...] "These eight new, fun, seaworthy toys inside <b>our</b> <b>Big</b> Kids Meals provide hours of aquatic entertainment for our young customers." ...|$|E
500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and that many of <b>our</b> <b>big</b> problems and scandals would go away if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of <b>our</b> <b>big</b> episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step out and try lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E

2500|$|At age five, Tall Chief was {{enrolled}} at the nearby Sacred Heart Catholic School. Impressed by her reading ability, the teachers allowed her to skip the first two grade levels. Between piano, ballet, and school work, Tall Chief had little free time, but loved the outdoors.

2500|$|The New South Wales Cricket Association said in its July 1920 {{annual report}} that [...] "(it {{is to be}} hoped) many of these players will be seen in <b>our</b> <b>big</b> matches next season". Unfortunately, many of the {{fourteen}} players had pre-war careers in other spheres, such as banking or farming or medicine, to which they soon returned. Bull, Docker, Long and Winning never played first-class cricket again after the AIF team disbanded. Trenerry played only three more first-class games. Lampard spent two more seasons with Victoria and retired in February 1922. Love, Murray and Willis continued {{to play in the}} Sheffield Shield for several seasons and Love eventually played for Australia just once in the 1932–33 Bodyline series. Even so, the AIF did bequeath a legacy to Australian Test cricket as Collins, Gregory, Oldfield, Pellew and Taylor formed the nucleus of Warwick Armstrong's team in the next two years, during which they overwhelmed England in two series.|$|E

2500|$|In 1909, Murphy {{published}} a column deploring the ongoing agitation against college football. He responded to charges {{that it was}} a brutal sport as follows: [...] "I am not disposed to deny that football is a rough game. But when cleanly played as it is in <b>our</b> <b>big</b> colleges, and when properly safeguarded the element of danger is almost entirely eliminated." [...] In response to proposals to replace football in American universities with either soccer or Canadian rugby, Murphy expressed disdain: [...] "Both of these are jokes when compared to the American game. They lack the science of our football and certainly would not prove very interesting to the spectators." [...] Murphy spoke in favor of removing restrictions on the forward pass, which he viewed as a spectacular play and one that weakens the defense. His main suggestions for eliminating injuries were to abolish the diving tackle, develop better padding, and eliminate the kickoff. With respect to the kickoff, Murphy noted: [...] "I have always felt that it was in the crash of the two teams that most accidents occurred." ...|$|E

Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: [...] "Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting". The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: [...] "Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something." [...] He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing".|$|E
2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade <b>our</b> <b>big</b> Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod.

[...] The Scream had a strong impact on other musicians.

Morrissey's main composer, Boz Boorer, also rated The Scream highly, ranking it second in his [...] "Top Five Desert Island Album Selection". Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson cited it as one of her all-time favourite records. The Scream was also hailed by the singer of Suede, Brett Anderson. [...] Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran said: [...] "The Scream [...] is a brilliant record – so enigmatic and different".
