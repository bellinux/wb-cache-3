40|$|Introduction: Laser tissue {{soldering}} is a {{new technique}} for repair of various tissues including the skin, liver, articular cartilage and nerves and is a promising alternative to suture. To overcome the problems of thermal damage to surrounding tissues and low laser penetration depth, some exogenous chromophores such as gold nanoshells, {{a new class of}} nanoparticles consisting of a dielectric core surrounded by a thin metal shell, are used. The aims of this study were to use two different concentrations of gold nanoshells as the exogenous material for skin tissue soldering and also {{to examine the effects of}} laser soldering parameters on the properties of the repaired skin. Material and Methods: Two mixtures of albumin solder and different concentrations of gold nanoshells were prepared. A full thickness incision of 2 × 20 mm 2 was made on the surface and after placing 50 μl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> <b>mixture</b> on the incision, an 810 nm diode laser was used to irradiate it at different power densities. The changes of tensile strength, σt, due to temperature rise, number of scan (Ns), and scan velocity (Vs) were investigated. Results: The results showed that the tensile strength of the repaired skin increased with increasing irradiance for both gold nanoshell concentrations. In addition, at constant laser irradiance (I), the tensile strength of the repaired incision increased with increasing Ns and decreasing Vs. In our case, this corresponded to st = 1610 g/cm 2 at I ~ 60 Wcm- 2, T ~ 65 ºC, Ns = 10 and Vs = 0. 2 mms- 1. Discussion and Conclusion: Gold nanoshells can be used as an indocyanine green dye (ICG) alterative for laser tissue soldering.  Although by increasing the laser power density, the tensile strength of the repaired skin increases, an optimum power density must be considered due to the resulting increase in tissue temperature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{differences}} in <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> thermal expansion (CTE) between the chip and the FR- 4 board generate the shear strains and the bending moment in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint. It {{seems to be}} a main cause <b>of</b> failure in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint when <b>the</b> chip and the FR- 4 board are heated repeatedly. Thus, the fatigue loading induced by thermal cycling is a major concern in <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint. <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> shear strain and the final failure are known to be influenced by varying boundary conditions such as <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> CTE, <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>solder,</b> <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint from <b>the</b> neutral point (DNP) and the temperature variation.

40|$|Abstract — One {{of major}} reasons of failure of solder joints {{is known as}} the thermal fatigue.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A damage {{coupling}} viscoplastic {{model is}} developed to predict fatigue life of solder alloy 63 Sn– 37 Pb under stress control. The viscoplastic flow rule chosen employs a hyperbolic sine function. A damage evolution equation is formulated based on three distinct material deformation behaviors: (i) stress rate independent damage evolution; (ii) stress rate dependent cyclic damage evolution; and (iii) stress rate dependent ductile damage evolution. The cyclic stress testing with different stress waveforms was first conducted to investigate their progressive viscoplastic deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> alloy. <b>The</b> investigation {{reveals that the}} material constants used in the model can be adequately determined from <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> standard creep tests. The constitutive model is validated by comparing the predicted and measured ratchetting results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> alloy under different forms <b>of</b> stress cycling. <b>The</b> proposed model {{is found to be}} capable <b>of</b> satisfactorily describing <b>the</b> viscoplastic deformation and ratchetting failure behaviors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> alloy under <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclic stress loading...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a {{rapid advance}} in the {{electronic}} packaging and the growing market for faster, lighter, smaller, yet less expensive electronic products, the low cost stencil printing based on flip-chip has attracted attention.

The mass accumulation near the anode side and the void nucleation near the cathode were observed during current stressing. In the preliminary experiment, the surface marker movement technique {{was used to measure}} the atomic flux driven by electromigration and to calculate <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> effective charge number and diffusivity (DZ*) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solder.</b> Subsequent experiments revealed that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> thermomigration due to joule heating makes <b>the</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> effective charge number and diffusivity erroneous when using marker movement technique...|$|R
