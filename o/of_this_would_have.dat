5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
25|$|A counter faller {{under the}} thread {{was made to}} rise {{to take in the}} slack caused by backing off. This could be used with the top faller wire to guide the yarn to the correct place on the cop. These were {{controlled}} by levers and cams and an inclined plane called the shaper. The spindle speed was controlled by a drum and weighted ropes, as the headstock moved the ropes twisted the drum, which using a tooth wheel turned the spindles. None <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been possible using the technology of Crompton's time, fifty years earlier.|$|E

If only we had got it right and let the market play God instead.Based on the premise that the market is the solution to all the problems of the human race, it is, too, a very religious fundamentalism.

25|$|Under the , local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} consider measures to improve the energy efficiency of all residential accommodation in their areas, although they {{are not required to}} implement any measures. Most {{local authorities}} provide free advice on energy conservation and some also provide home visits, often targeting those in social housing and the fuel poor. Some also demand minimum levels of energy efficiency in newly constructed buildings. It was expected that the Act would result in a 30% cut in energy usage between 1996 and 2010. An overall cumulative improvement of 14.7% was reported to DEFRA for the year ending March 2004, but a large part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> happened without HECA.|$|E
25|$|Bourne Market Place {{is at the}} {{crossroads}} of the A15 road and the B1193. Strictly speaking, it was a staggered pair of T-junctions where the A15 was met by the A151 from Spalding to the east and the B676 from the west (the article A151 road explains) before the B676 was redesignated {{as an extension of the}} A151 to Colsterworth. The A151 was diverted from the town centre via Cherry Holt Road and a newly opened relief road in 2005. When the rapid expansion of the town was first proposed in the early 1990s, development was scheduled to the north-east of the town, and part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a north/south bypass on the A15 under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. However, the chosen site was shifted to the south-west of the town, and the proposed by-pass was lost. A large volume of traffic is generated within the town, with the result that the A15 between Bourne and Peterborough is one of the busiest roads in the county. To the west of the town, the A6121 branches from the A151 and takes traffic towards Stamford.|$|E
500|$|Once the castle's deer {{park was}} established, intensively farmed fallow deer became common on the lands, {{although}} wild boar, foxes and hare were also hunted. Like other rural castles, {{the occupants of}} Okehampton Castle consumed a relatively large amount of venison, a prestige meat during the period. Some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come from the surrounding deer park, but prime cuts of venison, such as the haunches, were also brought in specially from other locations. Excavations have shown {{that in addition to}} fish from large ponds in the park, Okehampton Castle also imported fish from the coast, over [...] away, with hake, herring, plaice and whiting being most commonly eaten.|$|E

500|$|Fowler {{established}} a busy practice, working on many railway schemes across the country. He became chief engineer for the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and was engineer of the East Lincolnshire Railway, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Severn Valley Railway. In 1853, he became chief engineer of the Metropolitan Railway in London, the world's first underground railway. Constructed in shallow [...] "cut-and-cover" [...] trenches beneath roads, the line opened between Paddington and Farringdon in 1863. Fowler was also engineer {{for the associated}} District Railway and the Hammersmith and City Railway. Today these railways form {{the majority of the}} London Underground's Circle line. For his work on the Metropolitan Railway Fowler was paid the great sum of £152,000 (£ today), with £157,000 (£ today), from the District Railway. Although some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been passed on to staff and contractors, Sir Edward Watkin, chairman of the Metropolitan Railway from 1872, complained that [...] "No engineer in the world was so highly paid." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ABL {{system used}} {{infrared}} sensors for initial missile detection. [...] After initial detection, three low power tracking lasers calculated missile course, speed, aimpoint, and air turbulence. [...] Air turbulence deflects and distorts lasers. [...] The ABL adaptive optics use the turbulence measurement {{to compensate for}} atmospheric errors. [...] The main laser, located in a turret on the aircraft nose, could be fired for 3 to 5 seconds, causing the missile to break up in flight near the launch area. [...] The ABL was not designed to intercept TBMs in the terminal, or descending, flight phase. [...] Thus, the ABL would have had been within a few hundred kilometers of the missile launch point.

On March 30, 2010, {{it became the}} ninth most popular search on Google. The music video also prompted attention from Dallas city officials for Badu's public nudity and filming without city permits. Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> occurred had she stayed clothed.

2500|$|Donald Winnicott, {{who was a}} {{pediatrician}} and child psychoanalyst, had an immense influence on Bowlby's work and career. Bowlby and Winnicott had several similarities within their professional work as {{they were the first}} to explain the importance of social interactions at an early age. Both Bowlby and Winnicott argued that humans come into the world with a predisposition to be sensitive to social interactions and to need these interactions {{in order to have a}} healthy development. However, although Bowlby and Winnicott's ideas were similar, they took vastly different approaches when dealing with their research. For example, Bowlby was interested in how a child's environment is internalized and affects the child's development, while Winnicott was more interested in [...] "the way the inner world engages with and thereby is affected by external events". Despite their differences in approaching their research interests, Bowlby explained in an interview that his research for the World Health Organization influenced policies regarding child care; however, none <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been possible without the help of Winnicott. Winnicott worked more at a clinical level than Bowlby which influenced several social workers as he spent his career working to change policies. Bowlby explained that Winnicott is one of the more important individuals who was able to push Bowlby's work to change policies.|$|E

This intense modesty always remained a leading characteristic of his, which endeared him to many, although it was not one that helped him forward in life.

He prayed and trusted that she had got into no danger on her way (as he supposed) to Sherton, and thence to Exbury, if that were the place she had gone to, forbearing all inquiry which the strangeness of her departure would have made natural.
