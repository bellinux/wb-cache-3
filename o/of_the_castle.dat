5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> meres {{can still}} be seen to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> {{is similar to that}} used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E
5|$|The grounds were {{extensively}} {{planted with}} trees and shrubs, including over the motte. From the late 18th century until the 1850s the castle grounds were completely {{open to the}} public, but restrictions were imposed in 1858 and as a replacement the 434 acres of land {{to the west and}} north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was turned into Bute Park. From 1868, the castle grounds were closed to the public altogether. Stables were built just to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> but only half were completed during the 19th century. The Animal Wall was built along the south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> decorated with statues of animals, and the Swiss Bridge – a combination of summerhouse and river-crossing – was erected over the river by the West Gate. Cathays Park was built on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> but was sold to the city of Cardiff in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{receding}} {{coast line}} continued to threaten Sandgate Castle, and severe storms in 1927 and 1950 undermined large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> By {{the time that}} a new seawall {{was built in the}} early 1950s, the southern third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> had been entirely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Urse also {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of a new castle at the town of Worcester, although nothing now remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse had control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of earth}} banks, {{associated}} {{with one or}} other of the sieges, once stood where the Lawns stand, to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Septfontaines Castle (Château de Septfontaines, Buerg vu Simmer) {{in central}} Luxembourg is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castles</b> {{belonging}} to <b>the</b> Valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seven <b>Castles.</b> Located high above <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Septfontaines, <b>the</b> medieval <b>castle</b> is now privately owned.|$|R
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> main {{features}} is <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> heraldic devices found {{mainly on the}} west façade, which have been retained from <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> original construction. They depict <b>the</b> coats <b>of</b> arms belonging to local gentry and peers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> reconstruction from wood to stone.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle's</b> height, it had {{a strong}} protection: 164 cannons of varying sizes and 60 barrels <b>of</b> gunpowder. <b>The</b> <b>castle</b> was also {{surrounded}} by a deep moat, surrounded by high wooden walls, to protect <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> from invaders.|$|R
5|$|Aberdour Castle {{is located}} in the village of Easter Aberdour, Fife, Scotland. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable {{standing}} castles in Scotland, along with Castle Sween in Argyll, which was built at around the same time.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Goodrich Castle {{remained}} with the Earls of Kent until 1740, {{when it was}} sold by Henry Grey to Admiral Thomas Griffin. Griffin undertook some restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> but retained it as a ruin.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> stripped down what remained of the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
50|$|Mersch <b>Castle</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castles</b> {{belonging}} to <b>the</b> Valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seven <b>Castles.</b> Located in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, its history {{goes back to}} the 13th century.

5|$|Although now ruined as {{a result}} of the slighting, or {{deliberate}} partial destruction, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> after the English Civil War, Kenilworth illustrates five centuries of English military and civil architecture. The castle is built almost entirely from local new red sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls on the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> to make it look more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was excavated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> is an ivy-clad {{building}} built in 1845 as the Assize courts. This is still used today as Lincoln's Crown Courts.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over the Hall in 1772, remodelled the southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E
5|$|By 1725, {{the castle}} had become ruinous. Early in the century, the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> {{was sold to}} the town of Weymouth, whose people reused some of the stone to {{construct}} their new town bridge. Local tradition in the 19th century maintained that several houses in Weymouth were also constructed using stone taken from the castle. In 1825, the carved stone Elizabethan arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> were moved to All Saints Church in Wyke Regis. Captains continued to be formally appointed, however, and Gabriel Stewart held the post as late as 1795.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> the Starfish and Naval decoy sites were created to distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b>|$|E

5|$|Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660 and reinstated the Council of the Marches in 1661, but the castle never recovered from the war. Richard Vaughan, the Earl of Carbery, was appointed president and given £2,000 to renovate the castle, and between 1663 and 1665, a company of infantry soldiers was garrisoned there, overseen by the earl, {{with the task of}} safeguarding the money and contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> as well as the ammunition for the local Welsh militia. The Council of the Marches failed to reestablish itself and was finally disbanded in 1689, bringing an end to Ludlow Castle's role in government. Uncared for, the condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> rapidly deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, took charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> {{on behalf of the}} king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took over control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall and other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> After {{the death of the}} Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.|$|E
