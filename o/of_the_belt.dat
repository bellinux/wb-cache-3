5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt,</b> within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E

5|$|The interstate was {{proposed}} in the mid-1950s, along with I-15 and I-80 through Salt Lake City. At the time, only the western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> route was assigned as I-215. The eastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> route was designated Interstate 415. However, the I-415 designation was scrapped to provide a single route number for the entire route in 1969, with the I-215 designation covering the complete belt route. The freeway was constructed in segments, beginning with a section completed in 1963 from Redwood Road in North Salt Lake to 2100 North near the airport. Originally planned to be complete in the mid-1970s, challenges from citizens' groups over environmental impact statements led to {{the completion of the}} last section of I-215 in 1989 between 6200 South and 4500 South in Holladay.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E

5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, {{with the main}} concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E

5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between {{the orbits of}} the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The {{asteroid belt}} is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E
5|$|The northeastern part of Iran lies across part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> {{of active}} {{continental}} collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Iran is crossed by several major faults, with 90% {{of them being}} seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year; {{the area around the}} rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of this area are the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range. Qazvin Province, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> white <b>belt</b> pattern <b>of</b> Brown Swiss cattle is {{characterized}} by a lack of melanocytes in a stretch <b>of</b> skin around <b>the</b> midsection. This pattern is of variable width and sometimes <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> does not fully circle the body. To identify the gene responsible for this colour variation, we performed linkage mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belted</b> locus using six segregating half-sib families including 104 informative meioses for <b>the</b> <b>belted</b> character. <b>The</b> pedigree confirmed a monogenic autosomal dominant inheritance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belted</b> phenotype in Brown Swiss cattle.

5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} belt press wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> armor was removed, and half of her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E

5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E

5|$|Several storylines {{formed the}} {{background}} for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed {{that he was the}} rightful holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In {{the months leading up to}} Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had turned on his brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.|$|E
