40|$|Although recent {{developments}} in MS have enabled the identification and quantification of hundreds of phosphorylation sites from a given biological sample, phosphoproteome analysis by MS {{has been plagued by}} inconsistent reproducibility arising from automated selection of precursor ions for fragmentation, identification, and quantification. To address this challenge, we have developed a new MS-based strategy, based on multiple reaction monitoring of stable isotope-labeled peptides, that enables highly reproducible quantification of hundreds of nodes (phosphorylation sites) within a signaling network and across multiple conditions simultaneously. We have applied this strategy to quantify temporal phosphorylation profiles of 222 tyrosine phosphorylated peptides across seven time points following EGF treatment, including 31 tyrosine phosphorylation sites not previously known to be regulated by EGF stimulation. With this approach, 88 % of the signaling nodes were reproducibly quantified in four analyses, as compared with only 34 % by typical information-dependent analysis. As a result of the improved reproducibility, full temporal phosphorylation profiles were generated for an additional 104 signaling nodes with the multiple reaction monitoring strategy, an 88 % increase in <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signaling network. This method is broadly applicable to multiple signaling networks and to a variety of samples, including quantitative analysis of signaling networks in clinical samples.

40|$|The {{immune system}} (IS) {{and the central}} nervous system (CNS) are {{functionally}} coupled, and a large number of endogenous molecules (i. e., the chemokines for the IS and the classic neurotransmitters for the CNS) are shared in common between the two systems. These interactions are key elements for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of central inflammatory diseases. In recent years, evidence has been provided supporting the role of chemokines as modulators of central neurotransmission. It is the case of the chemokines CCL 2 and CXCL 12 that control pre- and/or post-synaptically the chemical transmission. This article aims to review the functional cross-talk linking another endogenous pro-inflammatory factor released by glial cells, i. e., the chemokine Regulated upon Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted (CCL 5) and the principal neurotransmitter in CNS (i. e., glutamate) in physiological and pathological conditions. In particular, the review discusses preclinical data concerning the role of CCL 5 as a modulator of central glutamatergic transmission in healthy and demyelinating disorders. The CCL 5 -mediated control of glutamate release at chemical synapses could be relevant either to the onset of psychiatric symptoms that often accompany the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), but also it might indirectly give a rationale for the progression of inflammation and demyelination. The impact of disease-modifying therapies for the cure of MS on the endogenous availability of CCL 5 in CNS will be also summarized.

40|$|Background: UniCarbKB aims {{to provide}} a {{resource}} for the representation of mammalian glycobiology knowledge by providing a curated database of structural and experimental data, supported by a web application that allows users to easily find and view richly annotated information. The database comprises two levels of annotation (i) global-specific data of oligosaccharides released and characterised from single purified glycoproteins and (ii) information pertaining to site-specific glycan heterogeneity. Additional, contextual information is provided including structural, bibliographic, and taxonomic information for each entry. Methods: Since the launch of UniCarbKB in 2012, we have continued to improve the organisation of our data model. Recently, we have extended our pipeline to collate structural and abundance changes of oligosaccharides in different human disease states and experimental models to extend <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human glycome. Results: In this manuscript, we demonstrate the capability of UniCarbKB to store and query relative glycan abundance data using a set of published colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines as examples. Furthermore, we outline our strategy for managing large-scale glycoproteomics data, site-specific and glycan compositional data, and how this information is adding value to UniCarbKB. Finally, we summarise our {{efforts to improve the}} efficient representation of disease terms and associated changes in glycan heterogeneity by integrating the Disease Ontology. Conclusions: Updates and improvements to UniCarbKB have introduced unique features for storing and displaying glycosylation features of mammalian glycoproteins.

40|$|Group I metabotropic {{glutamate}} (mGlu) receptors {{consists of}} mGlu 1 and mGlu 5 receptor subtypes. These receptors are widely {{distributed in the}} central nervous system (CNS), where they preferentially mediate facilitatory signaling in neurones and glial cells, mainly by favoring phospholipase (PLC) translocation. Based on the literature so far available, group I Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are preferentially expressed at the postsynaptic side of chemical synapsis, where they participate in the progression of the chemical stimulus. Studies, however, have shown the presence of these receptors also at the presynaptic level, where they exert several functions, including the modulation of transmitter exocytosis. Presynaptic Group I mGluRs can be both autoreceptors regulating release of glutamate and heteroreceptors regulating the release of various transmitters, including GABA, dopamine, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine. While the existence of presynaptic release-regulating mGlu 5 receptors is largely recognized, the possibility that mGlu 1 receptors also are present at this level has been a matter of discussion for a long time. A large body of evidence published in the last decade, however, supports this notion. This review aims at revisiting the data from in vitro studies concerning the existence and the role of release-regulating mGlu 1 receptors presynaptically located in nerve terminals isolated from selected regions of the CNS. The functional interaction linking mGlu 5 and mGlu 1 receptor subtypes at nerve terminals and their relative contributions as modulators of central transmission will also be discussed.

40|$|Background: The planorbid snail Indoplanorbis exustus is {{the sole}} {{intermediate}} host for the Schistosoma indicum species group, trematode parasites responsible for cattle schistosomiasis and human cercarial dermatitis. This freshwater snail is widely distributed in Southern Asia, ranging from Iran to China eastwards including India and from the southeastern Himalayas to Southeast Asia southwards. The veterinary and medical importance of this snail explains the interest in understanding its geographical distribution patterns and evolutionary history. In this study, we used a large and comprehensive sampling throughout Indo-Malaya, including specimens from South India and Indonesia, areas that have been formerly less studied. Results: The phylogenetic inference revealed five highly divergent clades (genetic distances among clades: 4. 4  13. 9 %) that are morphologically indistinguishable, supporting the assumption that this presumed nominal species may represent a cryptic species complex. The species group may have originated in the humid subtropical plains of Nepal or in southern adjacent regions in the Early Miocene. The major cladogenetic events leading to the fives clades occurred successively from the Early Miocene to the Early Pleistocene, coinciding with major periods of monsoonal intensification associated with major regional paleogeographic events in the Miocene and repeated climate changes due to the Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations. <b>Our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) highlights {{the presence of a}} single clade there. Contrary to expectations, an AMOVA did not reveal any population genetic structure among islands or along a widely recognised zoogeographical regional barrier, suggesting a recent colonisation independent of natural biogeographical constraints. Neutrality tests and mismatch distributions suggested a sudden demographic and spatial population expansion that could have occurred naturally in the Pleistocene or may possibly result of a modern colonisation triggered by anthropogenic activities. Conclusions: Even though Indoplanorbis is the main focus of this study, our findings may also have important implications for fully understanding its role in hosting digenetic trematodes. The existence of a cryptic species complex, the historical phylogeographical patterns and the recent range expansion in the IAA provide meaningful insights to the understanding and monitoring of the parasites potential spread.

This program was designed to explore those idioms. Almost all the baroque music now programed stems from Germany, i. e., Bach and Handel. Yet, it was in Italy that the Baroque era was first started, where the first steps away from the Baroque were taken, and in between, where the majority of baroque music was written. The monastery in Bologna has yielded more Baroque trumpet solos than has been found in all the rest of Europe combined. We have, therefore, avoided the more familiar, and elected to limit <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baroque period to Italy. The contemporary music in this program was selected from the three most important sources of modern stylistic influence: Igor Stravinsky, who wrote more idiomatic and grateful music for trumpet than any composer of this century; the Paris conservatory which, because of sheer volume if nothing else, dominates the contemporary solo market; and American commercial music. Girolamo Fantini was rknown throughout Europe as a trumpet virtuoso. The three sonatas are part of a group, written in 1638 that constitute the earliest solos for trumpet yet discovered. Rather than triadic figures in a martial style, Fabtini writes a song-like part for the trumpet, very unusual for this period. The Vivaldi, ???L??? Estro Armonico,??? Opus 3, No. 11, first movement is here arranged for brass quintet and organ by the author. Originally written for two solo violins and cello, plus orchestra, it is an example not only of the baroque period???s growing consciousness of harmonic function, but also of a young, avant???garde Vivaldi as well. The ???concerto in c major for trumpets,??? Opus 46, No. 1, is by a mature Vivaldi. It is as typical of late Italian Baroque writing for trumpet. There are many triadic, effective antiphonal passages for two trumpets. The Italian settecento period is combined with the modern French period in Marcel Bitsch???s ???four variations on a piece by Domenico scaratti. ??? Although the composition is modern, the eighteen century still remains discernible. A second tie to the past is Stravinsky???s ???Fanfare for a New Theatre. ??? a modern from of the trumpet???s oldest function. Originally written for Carl ???Doc??? Severinson, ???cornucopia??? is in a mildly commercial style. Composed by Jack Hayes, formerly a trumpeter in the ???big band??? era, the piece explores some of the more showy areas of American commercial trumpet playing. In the interest of stylistic variety, the program was not presented in historical order...|$|E
40|$|During 2004, {{researchers}} from U. S. Geological Survey's Columbia River Research Laboratory (USGS-CRRL) collected temperature, flow, and habitat data to characterize physical habitat condition and variation within and among tributaries and mainstem sections in the Wind River subbasin. Juvenile salmonid population surveys were conducted within select study areas throughout the subbasin. We expanded <b>our</b> survey <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstem Wind River to a reach in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> Carson National Fish Hatchery to assess effects of non-indigenous Chinook on native steelhead. These efforts add to {{a database of}} habitat and fish data collected in the Wind River since 1996. This research contributes to the Wind River Restoration Project, which includes active stream habitat restoration and monitoring of adult and juvenile steelhead populations. We maintained a network of 32 thermographs in the Wind River subbasin during 2004. Additionally, Underwood Conservation District provided us with data from seven thermographs that they maintained during 2004. Thermograph data are identifying areas with chronic high water temperatures and stream sections where high rates of warming are occurring. During 2004, water temperatures at 26 thermograph sites exceeded the 16 C limit for surface waters set by <b>the</b> Washington Department <b>of</b> Ecology. Water temperatures exceeded 20 C at five sites in the Trout Creek watershed. Our thermograph dataset includes information from as early as 1996 at some sites {{and has become a}} valuable long-term dataset, which will be crucial in determining bioenergetic relationships with habitat and life-histories. We have monitored salmonid populations throughout the Wind River subbasin by electrofishing and snorkeling. We electrofished four stream sections for population estimates during 2004. In these sections, and others where we simply collected fish without a population estimate, we tagged juvenile steelhead and Chinook salmon with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to track growth and movement of individuals. We snorkeled nine stream sections during 2004. Juvenile steelhead populations have varied greatly between streams and between years. Numbers of age- 0 steelhead have increased substantially since 2000 within the MINE reach (rkm 35. 0 - 40. 0) section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper Wind River. Because of potential negative interactions with steelhead, naturally spawned populations of introduced juvenile Chinook salmon are <b>of</b> concern in <b>the</b> mainstem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wind River. During 2004, we deployed over 3, 000 PIT tags in the Wind River subbasin, primarily in juvenile steelhead, but also in juvenile Chinook. We are compiling a dataset of recapture information on these tagged fish as well as interrogation information from Bonneville Dam and other sites. The habitat and fish data collected have been used in Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment modeling efforts, the Wind River Subbasin Plan, and the Total Maximum Daily Load report from Washington Department of Ecology. Continued monitoring of changes in habitat, combined with data on fish populations, will help guide planning efforts of land and fish managers. As long-term active and passive restoration actions are implemented in the Wind River and its tributaries, these data will provide the ability to measure change. Because the Wind River subbasin has no steelhead hatchery or supplementation, these data will be useful to compare population trends in subbasins with hatchery or supplementation management...|$|R
