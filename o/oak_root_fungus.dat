40|$|In California’s oak woodlands, {{survival}} {{and growth of}} oaks may depend on a symbiosis between <b>oak</b> <b>roots</b> and <b>fungi</b> that form ectomycorrhizas. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are major players in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) utilization and cycling because they facilitate water and nutrient uptake from the soil into the plant. The ECM fungi also benefit because plants supply carbohydrates to their fungal partners. Little {{is known about the}} stoichiometry of N and C exchange within ECM plants. It is not known whether N uptake and transfer from ECM fungi to their plant host is related to C flow from host to ECM fungi. We considered several questions. Do plants “reward ” those ECM fungal species that supply more N to the plant by providing more C to these ECM species? Are N and C transfers linked? Are ECM roots that take up more N from soils greater sinks for C? What are the longterm and short-term transfers of N and C, as measured by natural abundance (long-term) and tracer studies (short-term) ? The natural abundance (background levels) of 15 N and 13 C in oak seedlings sheds light on what are the N sources for oaks, and how oaks allocate C over the long term (years to decades).

These graphic comparisons between two sorts of information—visible fungus damage and historical evidence of presence of oak trees—give a generally consistent picture that seems useful for filling in gaps in our information, even though a number of precautions have to be observed and some further verification is possible.

40|$|The oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi is an {{aggressive}} plant pathogen, detrimental to many ecosystems including cork oak (Quercus suber) stands, and can inflict great losses {{in one of}} the greatest ‘hotspots’ for biodiversity in the world. Here, we applied Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics to disclose the metabolic patterns of cork <b>oak</b> <b>roots</b> and P. cinnamomi mycelium during {{the early hours of the}} interaction. As early as 2 h post-inoculation (hpi), cork <b>oak</b> <b>roots</b> showed altered metabolic patterns with significant variations for regions associated with carbohydrate, glycoconjugate and lipid groups when compared to mockinoculated plants. These variations were further extended at 8 hpi. Surprisingly, at 16 hpi, the metabolic changes in inoculated and mock-inoculated plants were similar, and at 24 hpi, the metabolic patterns of the regions mentioned above were inverted when compared to samples collected at 8 hpi. Principal component analysis of the FT-IR spectra confirmed that the metabolic patterns of inoculated cork <b>oak</b> <b>roots</b> could be readily distinguished from those of mock-inoculated plants at 2, 8 and 24 hpi, but not at 16 hpi. FT-IR spectral analysis from mycelium of P. cinnamomi exposed to cork <b>oak</b> <b>root</b> exudates revealed contrasting variations for regions associated with protein groups at 16 and 24 h post-exposure (hpe), whereas carbohydrate and glycoconjugate groups varied mainly at 24 hpe. Our results revealed early alterations in the metabolic patterns of the host plant when interacting with the biotrophic pathogen. In addition, the FTIR technique can be successfully applied to discriminate infected cork oak plants from mock-inoculated plants, although these differences were dynamic with time. To a lesser extent, the metabolic patterns of P. cinnamomi were also altered when exposed to cork <b>oak</b> <b>root</b> exudates...|$|R

40|$|Ectomycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} {{is essential}} for the life and health of trees in temperate and boreal forests where it {{plays a major role in}} nutrient cycling and in functioning of the forest ecosystem. Trees with ectomycorrhizal root tips are more tolerant to environmental stresses, such as drought, and biotic stresses such as root pathogens. Detailed information on these molecular processes {{is essential for}} the understanding of symbiotic tissue development in order to optimize the benefits of this natural phenomenon. Next generation sequencing tools allow the analysis of non model ectomycorrhizal plant-fungal interactions that can contribute to find the "symbiosis toolkits" and better define the role of each partner in the mutualistic interaction. By using 454 pyrosequencing we compared ectomycorrhizal cork <b>oak</b> <b>roots</b> with non-symbiotic roots. From the two cDNA libraries sequenced, over 2 million reads were obtained that generated 19, 552 cork <b>oak</b> <b>root</b> unique transcripts. A total of 2238 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed when ECM roots were compared with non-symbiotic roots. Identification of up- and down-regulated gens in ectomycorrhizal roots lead to a number of insights into the molecular mechanisms governing this important symbiosis. In cork <b>oak</b> <b>roots,</b> ectomycorrhizal colonization resulted in extensive cell wall remodelling, activation of the secretory pathway, alterations in flavonoid biosynthesis, and expression of genes involved in the recognition of fungal effectors. In addition, we identified genes with putative roles in symbiotic processes such as nutrient exchange with the fungal partner, lateral root formation or root hair decay. These findings provide a global overview of the transcriptome of an ectomycorrhizal host root, and constitute a foundation for future studies on the molecular events controlling this important symbiosis...|$|R

Pyrosequencing detected more Fusarium spp. in the roots of durum wheat after fungicide-treated chickpea than in non-fungicide treated chickpea. Plate culture revealed that the functional groups of fungi responded differently to fungicide use in the field but the effect on total community was non-significant. Highly virulent pathogens were not affected, but antagonists were suppressed. More fungal antagonists were detected after the chickpea CDC Luna than CDC Vanguard. Fungal species responded differently to the use of fungicides in vitro, but the aggregate inhibition effect on antagonists and highly virulent pathogens was similar. The effect of chickpea vs. pea previous crop and different chickpea termination times on <b>root</b> <b>fungi</b> of a following durum wheat crop was studied. The abundance of Fusarium spp. increased after cultivation of both cultivars of chickpea as compared to pea according to pyrosequencing and was negatively correlated with durum yield. Plate culture analysis revealed that fungal antagonists were more prevalent after pea than both cultivars of chickpea and chickpea CDC Vanguard increased the abundance of highly virulent pathogens. The abundance of highly virulent pathogens in durum wheat roots was negatively correlated to durum yield.

The landform exhibits patterned ground with mounds and vernal pools. The oaks are associated with buck brush (Ceanothus cuneatus) and with native and exotic grasses. In preparation for a study of the biocomplexity of common mycorrhizal networks among oaks and grasses, we examined the mycorrhizal morphotypes on Garry oak.

Using the fungal specific primers ITS 1 -F and ITS 4 and the restriction enzymes HinfI and TaqI, we amplified DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to compare ectomycorrhizal morphotypes.

We used terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and sequence analysis to detect 63 fungal species representing 28 different genera colonizing tree root tips. At least 32 species matched previously identified mycorrhizal fungi, with the remaining fungi including both saprotrophic and parasitic species.

Rhododendron maximum is a model ERM understory shrub that influences the nutrient cycles of montane hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians (North Carolina, USA). We sampled ERM roots of R. maximum from organic and mineral soil horizons and identified <b>root</b> <b>fungi</b> by amplifying and sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) collected from cultures and clones.

Supporting the idea that ERM fungi are adept saprotrophs, richness of root-fungi was greater in organic than in mineral soil horizons. To study the genetic diversity of oxidative enzymes that contribute to decomposition, we amplified and sequenced a portion of genes encoding multicopper oxidases (MCOs) from ERM ascomycetes. Most fungi possessed multiple copies of MCO sequences with strong similarities to known ferroxidases and laccases.
