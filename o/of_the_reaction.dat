5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b> This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed {{under the name}} Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes.

5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an aryl or allyl group, the reagent {{is referred}} to as a semi-stabilized ylide.

5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been formed and no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> is called pre-steady-state kinetics.

5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E

5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in toluene for months without 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on the severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction.</b> If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain.

Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E

5|$|Transition metals {{are usually}} present as trace {{elements}} in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant of those. These metals {{are used in}} some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> observed, 0.3nanobarns, also agreed well with theoretical predictions.
