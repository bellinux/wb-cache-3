40|$|After {{studying}} the gain {{or loss of}} <b>oxidizability</b> of glucose or ribose by each of standard strain bacteria such as Sh. flexneri 1 a, 2 a and 3 a, the following results were obtained. 1. <b>Oxidizability</b> of gluconate gradually takes place if bacteria are kept in contact with gluconate for more than 2 hours, but when pepton is loaded in addition <b>oxidizability</b> is enhanced markedly. Since streptomycine {{has been found to}} inhibit the production of enzyme oxidizing gluconate, it appears that enzyme is being produced adaptibly. 2. <b>Oxidizability</b> of ribose can be gradually realized by keeping bacteria in contact with ribose {{for a long period of}} time, and with addition of glucose it is enhanced strikingly. Moreover, as it is not inhibited by streptomycine, it seems reasonable to assume that riboseoxidizing enzyme existed in bacteria themselves from the first. 3. <b>Oxidizability</b> of gluconate is attained in various degrees by shaking bacteria with glucose; and in the case of Sh. flexneri 1 a it is pronounced while in the cases of 2 a and 3 a it is attained but slightly. As for the <b>oxidizability</b> of ribose, when ribose is shaken either with glucose or gluconate, in the case of Sh. flexneri 1 a it is marked while in the cases of 2 a and 3 a it is attained only slightly. 4. <b>Oxidizability</b> of gluconate or ribose already obtained can last for a quite long time even when the bacteria are stripped of these substrates, however, when bacteria are successively cultured on the medium not containing such substrates the <b>oxidizability</b> is lost immediately...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{find out}} whether serum <b>oxidizability</b> {{potential}} correlates with exercise test (EXT) parameters and predicts their results in chronic ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. METHODS: <b>Oxidizability</b> potential was determined {{in a group of}} chronic IHD patients who underwent a symptom limited EXT upon initiation of a cardiac rehabilitation program. The thermo-chemiluminescence (TCL) assay was used to assess serum <b>oxidizability</b> potential. This assay is based on heat-induced oxidation of serum, leading to the formation of electronically excited species in the form of unstable carbonyls, which further decompose into stable carbonyls and light energy (low chemiluminescence). Measured photons emission is represented by a kinetic curve which is described by its amplitude and slope (= ratio). We assessed the correlations of TCL ratio with exercise duration, metabolic equivalents (METS), maximal heart rate (mHR), maximal systolic BP, > 1 mm S-T depression, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > or 40 % (P < 0. 01). A trend for lower TCL ratio (%) was found in diabetic, hypertensive, and post-coronary bypass surgery patients. A paradoxically low TCL ratio (low <b>oxidizability</b> potential) was observed in patients without S-T depression compared to patients with S-T depression (189 ± 22 vs 201 ± 15, P = NS), due to the fact these patients had a much lower LVEF% and a lower exercise capacity. CONCLUSION: Serum <b>oxidizability</b> potential is associated with EXT parameters, results, and IHD severity. TCL ratio is an “easy-to-measure marker” that might be incorporated into risk assessment and prediction in chronic IHD patients...|$|E

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of zinc supplements on serum lipid <b>oxidizability</b> in diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, 60 diabetic patients were chosen and randomly divided into two groups. Serum lipid <b>oxidizability</b> and serum zinc level were evaluated in each group before and after zinc supplementation (25. 50 mg/day for 2 month).

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Oxidizability</b> of lipids in {{homogeneous}} solution varies linearly {{with the}} extent of their unsaturation. In vitro cellular, as well as in vivo, studies of <b>oxidizability</b> have generally relied upon chemical indicators of peroxidation such as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. To examine the <b>oxidizability</b> of lipids in cells, we have measured oxygen uptake and, using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping with a- (l-oxo- 4 -pyridyl) -N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), the real time generation of lipid-derived free radicals. We have used our experimental in vitro cellular lipid modification model to examine the rate and extent of lipid peroxidation versus the degree of lipid unsaturation in L 1210 murine leukemia cells. Lipid peroxidation was stimulated using the prooxidants iron, ascorbate, and the ether lipid compound 1 - 0 -octadecyl- 2 - 0 -methyl-ruc-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine. We did a total cellular lipid analysis to determine the number of lipid carbon-carbon double bonds contained in L 1210 cells enriched with eight fatty acids of different degrees of unsaturation. We found in cellular lipids that (i) lipid chain length had no apparent effect on the rate or extent of radical formation; (ii) the maximum amount of lipid radical generated increases with the total number of bis-allylic positions in the cellular lipids; and, most importantly, (iii) the rate of cellular lipid peroxidation increases exponentially with the number of bis-allylic positions. Our quantitative results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the number of bis-allylic positions contained in the cellular lipids of intact cells determines their susceptibility, i. e., <b>oxidizability,</b> to free radical-mediated peroxidative events. Lipid peroxidation is a free radical process comprised o...|$|E

BackgroundChronic renal failure {{is associated with}} accelerated atherosclerosis and {{a high incidence of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative modification of {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) is considered a key event in atherogenesis. MethodsWe studied the ex vivo <b>oxidizability</b> of LDL exposed to Cu 2 + ions (lag time, rate of propagation, maximum conjugated diene formation) and its relationship with LDL density, fatty acids, and antioxidants, along with plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and autoantibodies against Cu 2 +-, MDA-, and hypochlorous acid-modified LDL and plasma antioxidants in 17 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and 21 healthy control subjects. ResultsLDL α-and γ-tocopherol and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations were significantly higher in the CAPD patients. LDL density was shifted to small, dense LDL. LDL <b>oxidizability</b> was comparable to that of healthy subjects. Lag time correlated positively with LDL α-tocopherol and inversely with both total PUFA concentrations and density; the rate of oxidation and LDL density correlated positively with total PUFA and total fatty acid concentrations, respectively. Ratios of autoantibody titers against oxidized to native LDL did not differ between the two groups. While plasma α-and γ-tocopherol concentrations and tocopherol to cholesterol ratios were significantly higher, vitamin C concentrations were very low in the CAPD patients. MDA concentrations were 1. 7 times higher than in healthy subjects. Conclusions(I) Ex vivo LDL <b>oxidizability</b> is normal in CAPD patients as a result of officient protection by LDL-associated lipophilic antioxidants, although the LDL composition is altered toward high oxidizability; and (2) the plasma antioxidant screen is insufficient due to impaired vitamin C status...|$|E

The paper attempts theoretically to assess the potential of oils from six microalgae species available in north part of India {{for the production of}} biodiesel on the basis on oxidation stability index and <b>Oxidizability.</b> Based on the fatty acid compositions, APE and BAPE are find theoretically.

Feeding of rats on HC-diet supplemented with 10 % of currant oil (from Ribes nigrum L.) containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 61. 1 % of n– 6 and 15. 4 % of n– 3) and lower amounts of saturated (SFA, 7. 7 %) and monounsaturated (MUFA, 14. 3 %) fatty acids caused {{a significant decrease in}} plasma cholesterol associated with a mild decrease in VLDL-C and an increase in HDL-C, when compared to rats fed on HC-diet with 10 % of lard fat containing low amounts of PUFA (7. 7 % of n– 6 and 0. 7 % of n– 3) and higher amounts of SFA (42. 7 %) and MUFA (47. 5 %). However, currant oil feeding led to the increased <b>oxidizability</b> of LDL. Silymarin, but not SPC, was effective in prevention of development of dietary induced hypercholesterolemia in the both dietary fats with slightly better result in diet containing the currant oil. On the other hand, SPC supressed more effectively than silymarin LDL <b>oxidizability.</b> The results suggest that antihypercholesterolemic effect of SM in rats fed on HCdiet is improved by dietary currant oil, but the currant oil induces an increased <b>oxidizability</b> of LDL.

40|$|La matière organique présente dans une eau clarifiée et ozonée puis filtrée sur charbon a été caractérisée durant 8 mois par l'oxydabilité au KMnO 4 à chaud et en milieu acide; on a relevé les paramètres climatiques et noté les traitements de potabilisation appliqués. Une analyse en {{composantes}} principales suivie d'une analyse discriminante effectuée sur 129 prélèvements fait ressortir que deux paramètres - la température et le pH - suffisent à classer ces eaux en 3 groupes : chacun d'eux correspond à une saison, avec un pourcentage d'erreur de 6 %. En moyenne, l'oxydabitité de l'eau à l'entrée du filtre ne varie pas d'une saison à l'autre; mais la dispersion des valeurs est plus importante au printemps. La politique de traitement appliquée n'apparaît pas clairement. Des analyses de variance suivies de régressions linéaires multiples montrent que cette oxydabilité dépend à la fois de la séquence et du traitement d'ozonation : moins de 30 % de La variance se trouvent ainsi expliqués. La filtration sur charbon à 5 m. h- 1 abaisse l'oxydabilité de G à 0, 8 mg O 2 par litre et diminue sa variabilité. On note cependant des relargages en fin de printemps lors du rééquilibrage du filtre. L'oxydabilité de l'eau filtrée dépend à la fois de celle mesurée à l'entrée du filtre et de la température : les modèles retenus, déterminés par régression linéaire multiple, diffèrent d'une saison à l'autre, indiquant un fonctionnement différent du réacteur. Il est alors possible de définir des périodes où {{elle est}} minimale. La qualité d'une eau affinée varie ainsi avec les saisons, ceci malgré un lissage dû aux effets des traitements appliqués en amont. <b>Oxidizability</b> by KMnO 4 {{in a hot}} acidic medium was used for 8 months to estimate organic matter in clarified-ozonized then GAC-filtered waters, treated on a pilot plant (Figure 1). Flowrate of the River Seine (DEB), temperature (TEM), pH (PHE) and <b>oxidizability</b> of the waters before GAC-filtration (OXE) are shown to vary with time (Figures 2 to 5). The first two parameters are generally used to classify raw waters but here they are not enough (Figure 6). Then, multivariate statistical analyses - principal component analysis and discriminant analysis - are carried out on 129 samples : they show (Figure 7) that two parameters, one in connection with climate only - temperature - {{and the other in}} connection with both climate and treatments - pH - are able to classify these waters into three groups equivalent to three seasons; the error coefficient is of 6 % only. Seasonal characteristics of these waters are given in Table 1. Average values of <b>oxidizability</b> (OXE) do not vary with the seasons, but standard-deviation is the greatest in Spring. There is no apparent connection between the different treatments - preozonation level (PO 3), quantity of flocculant added (WAC), land-filtration velocity (VFS), ozonation level (O 3 F), residual ozone level (O 3 R), GAC-filtration flowrate (DAL) - except between the two ozonation treatments (Figure 3). Their seasonal variations are given in Table 2. Variance analyses show that the 3 factors, quantity of floccutant (WAC), sand-filtration velocity (VFS) and absence of preozonation (PO 3), have no effect upon the <b>oxidizability</b> of the water supptying the GAC-filter (OXE). This parameter is a function of preozonation (PO 3), interozonation (O 3 F) and residual ozone levels (O 3 R) and sequency (SEQ)  : the models achieved, determined by linear multiple regression, account for less than 30 % of the variance (Figure 9). The GAC-filtration at 5 m. h- 1 diminishes the <b>oxidizability</b> values of zero to 0. 8 mg O 2 l- 1 and their variability; however, some releases appear at the end of Spring, during the re-equilibration phase of the filter (Figure 10). By linear multiple regression, we can express the <b>oxidizability</b> of the filtered waters (OXS) as a function of (OXE) and temperature (TEM). The models achieved differ from one season to another (Figure 11) and account for 32 to 73 % of the variance; thus the working of the GAC-filter is dependent on the seasons. Many authors assume that the risk of bacterial regrowth in the distribution network is minimal when the <b>oxidizability</b> of the treated waters is minimal. Here, the <b>oxidizability</b> of the filtered waters (OXS) is at its lowest when temperature (TEM) and (OXE) are lowest (Figures 12 and 13). These conditions are often met {{in the middle of the}} seasons, when the quantity and the quality of the organic matter vary little; the fitter is then balanced. The quality of a treated water therefore varies with the seasons, despite polishing obtained through treatments applied upstream, which tend to improve it and diminish its variability...|$|E

Conversely, systemic arterial compliance improves through eating {{of fish and}} fish oil. We therefore tested the value of high intake of alpha-linolenic acid, the plant precursor of fish fatty acids. Fifteen obese people with markers for insulin resistance ate in turn four diets of 4 weeks each: saturated/high fat (SHF), alpha-linolenic acid/low fat (ALF), oleic/low fat (OLF), and SHF. Daily intake of alpha-linolenic acid was 20 g from margarine products based on flax oil. Systemic arterial compliance was calculated from aortic flow velocity and aortic root driving pressure. Plasma lipids, glucose tolerance, and in vitro LDL <b>oxidizability</b> were also measured. Systemic arterial compliance during {{the first and last}} SHF periods was 0. 42 +/- 0. 12 (mean +/- SD) and 0. 56 +/- 0. 21 units based on milliliters per millimeter of mercury. It rose significantly to 0. 78 +/- 0. 28 (P <. 0001) with ALF; systemic arterial compliance with OLF was 0. 62 +/- 0. 19, lower than with ALF (P <. 05). Mean arterial pressures and results of oral glucose tolerance tests were similar during ALF, OLF, and second SHF; total cholesterol levels were also not significantly different. However, insulin sensitivity and HDL cholesterol diminished and LDL <b>oxidizability</b> increased with ALF.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the effects of statins on the quality of {{circulating}} low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in relation to atherosclerosis progression. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized trial of 325 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), we assessed the effects of high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) and conventional-dose simvastatin (40 mg) on LDL subfraction profile (n = 289), LDL <b>oxidizability</b> (n = 121), and circulating autoantibodies to oxidized LDL (n = 220). Progression of atherosclerosis was measured by carotid intima media thickness (IMT) (n = 325). Results: At baseline, the patients showed an intermediate LDL subfraction profile composed of three LDL subfractions (LDL 1, LDL 2, LDL 3), with LDL 2 as the predominant subfraction. A strong negative correlation was found between plasma triglycerides and the LDL subfraction profile (r = -. 64, p =. 000). Both plasma levels of triglycerides and small dense LDL 3 correlated weakly with baseline IMT (r =. 11, p =. 04 and r =. 15, p =. 01, respectively; n = 289). No association was found between baseline IMT and oxidation parameters or circulating antibodies to oxidized LDL. Atorvastatin reduced triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and all LDL subfractions {{to a greater extent than}} did simvastatin and led to regression of carotid IMT. However, LDL subfraction pattern and plasma levels of autoantibodies to oxidized LDL remained unchanged in both treatment groups, and LDL <b>oxidizability</b> increased minimally to a similar extent in both groups. Significant treatment differences were found for the rate of in vitro oxidation of LDL and the amount of dienes formed during in vitro oxidation of LDL, which both decreased more following atorvastatin than after simvastatin.

40|$|Paraoxonase (PON- 1) is a {{high-density}} lipoprotein (HDL) associated enzyme that hydrolyzes lipid peroxides in vitro, which may therefore {{protect against the}} onset of atherosclerosis. Heavy smokers are more exposed to oxidative stress and hence at high-risk for oxidative modification of LDL. Our hypothesis is that the anti-oxidative properties of PON- 1 inhibit LDL oxidation, especially in populations exposed to high oxidative stress. We have studied the effects of PON- 1 genotype and smoking to variation in oxidative status parameters and intima-media thickness (IMT), {{a surrogate marker of}} atherosclerosis.

Smoking was associated with IMT in subgroups with the high levels of LDL, but not in the population at large.

In addition, we monitored production of superoxide by leukocytes ex vivo. It was found that compared to nonsmokers (n = 33) plasma levels of IgG but not IgM autoantibodies against oxLDL and concentrations of sICAM- 1 in smokers were significantly elevated (30 and 42 %, respectively). After supplementation with a-tocopherol concentration of TBARS in plasma and in vitro <b>oxidizability</b> of LDL had decreased, but autoantibodies and sICAM- 1 had not changed. Production of superoxide was not different between a-tocopherol- and placebo-treated smokers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{patients}} with chronic renal failure undergoing regular hemodialysis (HD), oxidative stress {{is involved in the}} development of dialysis-related pathologies. The aim {{of the study was to}} measure the effect of HD treatment on the general antioxidative status of serum with special consideration of the specific <b>oxidizability</b> of lipids and proteins. Indicators for the oxidative/antioxidative status of plasma were monitored at the beginning and at the end of a dialysis session on the arterial and venous side of the dialyzer. A decrease in the antioxidant status was accompanied by an increased <b>oxidizability</b> of proteins as well as lipids during HD treatment. During the first passage of the dialyzer, the lag time of lipid oxidation decreased from 114. 0 ± 19. 8 to 81. 5 ± 18. 9 min, the lag time of protein oxidation decreased from 105. 0 ± 24. 6 to 72. 9 ± 21. 3 min and the total antioxidative status decreased from 518 ± 24 to 252 ± 124 μM trolox equivalents. The carbonyl content of serum proteins was high in {{patients with}} end stage renal disease (ESRD) (3. 9 ± 1. 1 vs. 0. 9 ± 0. 1 nmol/mg in controls) but did not change significantly during dialysis procedure. Our data demonstrate that the susceptibility of serum lipids and proteins to oxidative modification is severely increased by HD treatment...|$|E
40|$|Free radical-mediated peroxidation of {{biological}} mole-cules, especially of lipids, is {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis {{of a number of}} diseases like multiple sclerosis. Low concentration of antioxidant vitamins: beta carotene, retinol, alpha tocopherol and ascorbic acid have been observed in serum or cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients. On the basis of these observations, we studied the potential lipoprotein oxidation and total antioxidant capacity in the patho-genesis of multiple sclerosis. Lipoprotein <b>oxidizability</b> for plasma in vitro, serum levels of autoantibodies against oxidized low-density lipoproteins, plasma total homocysteine levels with vitamin B 12 and folate, and plasma total antioxidant capacity were measured in twenty four patients with multiple sclerosis and twenty four healthy sex- and age-matched person as control. In multiple sclerosis patients during an attack, a significant increase in both in vitro lipid <b>oxidizability</b> for plasma and in the levels of autoantibodies against oxidized low-density lipoproteins, and a strong decrease in plasma total antioxidant capacity were detected. Plasma total homocysteine levels were significantly higher in multiple sclerosis patients whose plasma vitamin B 12 and folate levels were lower but not statistically significant, than controls. The present study indicates that lipoprotein oxidation may be important factor in the course of multiple sclerosis and in vitro measurements of plasma oxidation kinetics as an indication for lipoprotein oxidation might be useful as an additional tool for the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis...|$|E

Objective: To assess the acceptability of walnuts and their effects on serum lipid levels and low-density lipopro-tein (LDL) <b>oxidizability</b> in free-living hypercholesterolemic persons. Design: Randomized, crossover feeding trial. Setting: Lipid clinic at a university hospital. Patients: 55 men and women (mean age, 56 years) with polygenic hypercholesterolemia.

Patients followed each diet for 6 weeks...|$|E
40|$|Ribonuclease is spontaneously inactivated in the {{presence}} of atmospheric oxygen. This inactivation can be suppressed by reduced glutathione or cyteine. New forms of the protein appear during the oxidation process. These forms, which are separable by chromatography, have low enzymic activity; they can be activated by reducing agents. The <b>oxidizability</b> of the samples is very variable and apparently depends on their initial state. The presence of reduced glutathione or gelatin prevents oxidation, dilution of the solution favours it.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the age-related susceptibility of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) to oxidation. HDL {{were obtained from}} healthy, normolipidemic young, middle-aged and elderly subjects. Oxidation of HDL was induced in vitro by oxygen free radicals generated by water γ-radiolysis, and followed by the decrease of endogenous vitamin E {{and the formation of}} conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, as well as the alterations of apolipoproteins A-I/A-II. The resistance of HDL to oxidation, evaluated by the length of the lag phase, decreased with aging. This increased <b>oxidizability</b> of HDL with aging could have a dramatic impact on the development of atherosclerosis in the elderly population...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCholesteryl sulfate (CS) {{is a minor}} {{component}} of cell membranes, also present in lipoproteins, and its exact function is unknown. Since oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) {{is thought to be}} an important determinant of atherogenesis, we investigated the influence of CS enrichment on copper-mediated oxidation of LDL. CS was found to act as a pro-oxidant, as measured by lipid oxidation parameters. The results also suggest that these effects were dependent on the sulfate group since pure cholesterol or cholesteryl acetate did not promote Cu 2 +-mediated oxidation. Our findings imply that CS may affect the <b>oxidizability</b> and hence the potential atherogenicity of LDL...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the serum cholesterol, apolipoproteins and LDL <b>oxidizability</b> in young Japanese {{women and men}} during walnut consumption and to evaluate its active principle. Design: Experimental study with a randomized design. Subjects: Twenty healthy women and 20 healthy men. Interventions: Subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} consume each of two mixed natural diets for 4 weeks in a cross-over design. Reference and walnut diets were designed and the walnut diet had 12. 5 % of the energy derived from walnuts (44 – 58 g=day). Results: The total cholesterol and serum apolipoprotein B concentrations, and the ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol was significantly lowered in women and men when fed on the walnut diet, than when on the reference diet (P 0. 05). The LDL cholesterol concentration was significantly lowered in women on the walnut diet (0. 22 mmol=l, P 0. 0008), whereas this decrease was not significant in men (0. 18 mmol=l, P 0. 078). The most prominent change in the fatty acid composition of the cholesteryl esters from serum after the walnut diet was an elevation of a-linolenic acid in women (76 %, P< 0. 001) and men (107 %, P< 0. 001). This elevation was negatively correlated to the change in LDL cholesterol in women (r 0. 496, P 0. 019) and men (r 0. 326, P 0. 138). The LDL <b>oxidizability</b> in women was not influenced by the diets (P 0. 19). Conclusions: a-Linolenic acid in the walnut diet appears to be responsible for the lowering of LDL cholesterol in women...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of {{oily fish}} and fish oils is {{associated}} with protection against cardiovascular disease. Paradoxically, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids present in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are suggested to be susceptible to oxidation. It {{is not clear whether}} eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have similar effects on the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation or whether they affect the thrombogenicity of oxidized LDL. This study examined the influence of highly purified preparations of EPA and DHA on LDL <b>oxidizability</b> and LDL-supported thrombin generation in healthy human volunteers. Forty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive olive oil (placebo), an EPA-rich oil or a DHA-rich oil for 4 weeks at a dose of 9 g oil/day. EPA and DHA were incorporated into LDL phospholipids and cholesteryl esters during the supplementation period, but were progressively lost during ex vivo copper-mediated oxidation. Following supplementation, the EPA treatment significantly increased the formation of conjugated dienes during LDL oxidation compared with baseline, whereas the DHA treatment had no effect. Neither treatment significantly affected the lag time for oxidation, oxidation rate during the propagation phase or maximum diene production. Neither EPA nor DHA significantly affected the thrombotic tendency of oxidized LDL compared with the placebo, although DHA tended to decrease it. In conclusion, there are subtle differences in the effects of EPA and DHA on the <b>oxidizability</b> and thrombogenicity of LDL. DHA does not appear to increase the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation to the same degree as EPA and has a tendency to decrease LDL-supported thrombin generation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 45 well-defined patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia, {{the effect of}} gemfibrozil (1, 200 mg/day) or simvastatin (20 mg/day) on apolipoprotein-B (apo-B) -containing lipoproteins, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction profile, and LDL <b>oxidizability.</b> Although both drugs reduced plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, gemfibrozil reduced plasma triglycerides more effectively and simvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol more effectively. LDL cholesterol was reduced with simvastatin. With both drugs, total serum apo-B concentration decreased. With gemfibrozil, {{this was due to}} an exclusive reduction (- 46 %) of very low/intermediate-density lipoprotein (VLDL + IDL) apo-B, whereas simvastatin decreased apo-B in both VLDL + IDL and LDL (34 % and 15 %, respectively). Initially, a dense LDL subfraction profile was present in all patients. The decrease in LDL cholesterol with simvastatin was due to a decrease in all isolated LDL subfractions except LDL 2; gemfibrozil increased LDL 1 and LDL 2 cholesterol (p = 0. 001) and reduced LDL 4 cholesterol, resulting in a more buoyant LDL subfraction profile compared with simvastatin. In both groups, a predominance of small dense LDL remained despite therapy. LDL fatty acid composition showed a shift from oleic acid to linoleic acid after gemfibrozil; arachidonic acid increased after simvastatin. Vitamin E was lower after gemfibrozil. In the measurements of LDL oxidation, only the oxidation rate was significantly reduced with simvastatin. Thus, quantitative and qualitative changes of LDL cholesterol had only a small effect on total in vitro LDL <b>oxidizability</b> in this population with familial combined hyperlipidemi...|$|E
