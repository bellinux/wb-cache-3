5|$|Space is also crisscrossed with {{continuum}} fluxes, coordinate pairs {{that allow}} instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> costs and travel time, though it causes {{all but the}} most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings.|$|E
5|$|Air America {{helicopters}} {{continued to}} make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult. Helicopters overflew the designated LZs to check no Americans {{had been left behind}} and then the last helicopters (many low <b>on</b> <b>fuel)</b> headed out to TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E

5|$|As of 2015, 1,464MW of {{the total}} thermal {{installed}} capacity was from state-owned fossil fuel power stations: 900MW from Lakvijaya, 380MW from the state-owned portion of Kelanitissa, 160MW from Sapugaskanda, and 24MW from Uthuru Janani. The remaining 641MW of the installed thermal capacity are from six privately owned power stations. All thermal power stations run <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, except Lakvijaya, which run on coal.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 7:40pm, the 727 {{took off}} with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> and turning back near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; to save <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, {{she had the}} upper floors of the house closed off.

5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E
5|$|Replenishment ships, {{known as}} oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are ships {{that can provide}} oil {{products}} to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called underway replenishment, extends {{the length of time}} a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective range. Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take <b>on</b> <b>fuel.</b> In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies <b>on</b> <b>fuel,</b> increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E

5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to overshoot and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low <b>on</b> <b>fuel,</b> broke off and headed north.|$|E
5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. By late afternoon, with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low <b>on</b> <b>fuel)</b> and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slowed by}} {{industrial}} action after the war, and was suspended on 21October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase {{the ship and}} have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of Eagle on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20April 1920. Only two of her boilers, converted to run <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> oil only, could be used during the trials.|$|E

5|$|From Madras, Müller had {{originally}} intended to rendezvous with his colliers off Simalur Island in Indonesia, but instead {{decided to make a}} foray to the western side of Ceylon. On 25 September, Emden sank a pair of British merchantmen and two days later, captured the collier Buresk, which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German prize crew went aboard Buresk and she was thereafter used to support Emdens operations. Later that day, the German raider sank two more British vessels. Low <b>on</b> <b>fuel,</b> Emden proceeded to the Maldives to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while her crew replenished her coal stocks. The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and Mauritius for two days without success. Emden thereafter steamed to Diego Garcia for engine maintenance and to rest her crew.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Historian Samuel E. Morison {{noted in}} 1949 that Spruance was {{subjected}} to much criticism for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, thus allowing their surface fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance pressed on, {{he would have been}} unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruisers would have been overwhelmed by Yamamoto's powerful surface units, including Yamato. Furthermore, the American air groups had suffered considerable losses, including most of their torpedo bombers. This made it unlikely that they would be effective in an airstrike against the Japanese battleships, even if they had managed to catch them during daytime. Also, by this time Spruance's destroyers were critically low <b>on</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low <b>on</b> <b>fuel.</b> A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, whilst {{serving in}} the Afghanistan conflict, Flight Lieutenant Craig Wilson, Captain of ZA718/BN from 1310 Flt in Helmand Province, {{received}} the third Distinguished Flying Cross for 'exceptional courage and outstanding airmanship' while operating in Helmand Province. During the night of 11 June 2006, Flt Lt Craig Wilson was tasked with picking up a casualty. The mission was successful despite the difficult and dangerous conditions that led Wilson to fly the aircraft at the low altitude of 150ft. A few hours after this incident, the helicopter was called out again on operations, with Wilson landing the helicopter despite being low <b>on</b> <b>fuel.</b> After being on duty for over 22 hours, Wilson volunteered to take reinforcements to the front line, returning with two wounded soldiers. For his actions over the 24‑hour period Flt Lt Wilson was awarded the DFC.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{advance to}} the {{southeast}} of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet 294th Rifle Division was encircled at Weißenberg by the Brandenburg Division. In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, {{large parts of the}} 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was able to break into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody house-to-house combat. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days. Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> supplies. The recapture of Bautzen {{was one of the last}} successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.|$|E
