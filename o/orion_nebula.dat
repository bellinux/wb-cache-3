Along with the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula</b> and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years.

Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula.</b> Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the <b>Orion</b> <b>nebula.</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Our Sun is a {{very common}} and {{ordinary}} star. There is really nothing to distinguish it from a myriad of other similar stars in this region of the Galaxy. Yet, the Sun possesses a marvelous system of nine diverse planets. This has led {{us to believe that}} the formation of planetary systems should be a natural, common result of the process of star formation. We expect that a significant fraction of Solar-type stars should have some type of planetary system in orbit around them. The discovery by the HST of disks of dust around many stars in the <b>Orion</b> <b>nebulae</b> certainly reinforces that feeling. The quest to discover [1] 2 Marcy, Cochran, Mayor and explore these extrasolar planetary systems {{has proven to be a}} difficult and elusive task that has occupied astronomers for decades.

25|$|The {{fine point}} of what {{constitutes}} an asterism {{may be seen in}} two examples. Theta Orionis (θ Ori) is embedded in, and illuminates, the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula</b> (M42). Looked at telescopically, it resolved into four stars arranged in a trapezoid, and they were nicknamed the Trapezium. The asterism retained this name even when it was discovered that there were yet more stars in the group. However, it has since been determined that the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula</b> is a stellar nursery and that the Trapezium is actually an Open Cluster. Thus it is no longer an asterism. On the other hand, M73 in Aquarius, which was thought to be an Open Cluster, turns out to be composed of unrelated stars, and may now be considered to be an asterism.|$|E

25|$|The {{familiar}} red H-alpha {{spectral line}} of hydrogen gas, {{which is the}} transition from the shell n=3 to the Balmer series shell n=2, is one of the conspicuous colours of the universe. It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of emission or ionisation nebula, like the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebula,</b> which are often HII regions found in star forming regions. In true-colour pictures, these nebula have a distinctly pink colour from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question in the}} context of structure formation concerns the transition from massive primordial stars to Population I/II stars with typical masses of less than 1 M_Sol, and in particular the physical mechanisms inducing this transition. The purpose of this work is to study the physical mechanisms that shape the stellar IMF at {{the early stages of the}} Universe. With this aim, we perform a set of eight hydrodynamic simulations that include sink particles representing contracting protostars. Evidence for fragmentation was found in all cases, and hence we conclude that there is no critical metallicity below which fragmentation is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a clear change in the characteristic mass of the clouds at Z = 10 ^- 4 Z_Sol. Moreover, we develop a model for the stellar IMF, which accounts for the evolution of simulated clusters. With that, we can recover results from hydrodynamic simulations, and also observations of the <b>Orion</b> <b>Nebulae</b> Cluster. Finally, we find that the resultant stellar mass distribution is highly dependent on the characteristic mass of the cluster, and the mode of mass accretion...|$|R

40|$|Sulfur abundances {{are derived}} for {{a sample of}} ten B main-sequence star members of the Orion association. The {{analysis}} is based on LTE plane-parallel model atmospheres and non-LTE line formation theory {{by means of a}} self-consistent spectrum synthesis analysis of lines from two ionization states of sulfur, S ii and S iii. The observations are high-resolution spectra obtained with the ARCES spectrograph at the Apache Point Observatory. The abundance distribution obtained for the Orion targets is homogeneous within the expected errors in the analysis: A(S) = 7. 15 ± 0. 05. This average abundance result is in agreement with the recommended solar value (both from modelling of the photospheres in 1 -D and 3 -D, and meteorites) and indicates that little, if any, chemical evolution of sulfur has taken place in the last ∼ 4. 5 billion years. The sulfur abundances of the young stars in Orion are found to agree well with results for the <b>Orion</b> <b>nebulae,</b> and place strong constraints on the amount of sulfur depletion onto grains as being very modest or nonexistent. The sulfur abundances for Orion are consistent with other measurements at a similar galactocentric radius: combined with previous results for other OB-type stars produce a relatively shallow sulfur abundance gradient with a slope of − 0. 037 ± 0. 012 dex Kpc− 1.
