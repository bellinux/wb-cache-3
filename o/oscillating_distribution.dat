40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{degree of}} {{difficulty}} associated with inverting seismic traveltime data for wave speed distribution is largely determined by the contrasts present in the propagating medium. If velocity contrasts are small, seismic waves are only weakly refracted and straight ray tomographic algorithms will give adequate results (Dines and Lytle, 1979; Lytle and Dines, 1980). If the velocity contrasts are large, then seismic waves are strongly refracted, implying that nonlinear tomography algorithms are required to invert such data. On the other hand, if the measurement configuration of sources and receivers has a severely limited range of view angles (as {{is often the case}} in crosswell geotomography), then the reconstruction will not place enough natural constraints (i. e., those derived from data) on the velocity model. In this situation, it is commonly observed that raw reconstructions (prior to regularization) produce wildly <b>oscillating</b> velocity <b>distribution...</b>|$|R

The shorter core length jets tend to entrain ambient air more rapidly, inducing larger hover lift losses, and decay more rapidly, reducing adverse ground erosion. In transition flight, shorter core length jets show a larger {{decrease in the}} lift loss and a slight decrease in nose-up pitching moment. Supercritical pressure ratio jets tend to have longer, higher pressure core lengths with a greater hazard for ground erosion.

For subsonic jets the decay is inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} jet exit.

40|$|We {{update the}} method of the Holmberg & Flynn (2000) study, {{including}} an updated model of the Milky Way's interstellar gas, radial velocities, an updated reddening map, and a careful statistical analysis, to bound the allowed surface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to the self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the dark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer stars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the vertical direction {{as well as a}} displacement from the expected location at the Galactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the bound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In the first, traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement from the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a non-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk parameters for an <b>oscillating</b> tracer <b>distribution.</b> Despite updates in the mass model and reddening map, the traditional method results remain consistent with those of HF 2000. The second, non-equilibrium technique, however, allows a surface density as large as 14 M_ pc^- 2 (and as small as 0), demonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques, the bound on surface density is weaker for larger scale height. In future analyses of Gaia data, it will be important to verify whether the tracer populations are in equilibrium.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the two- and {{three-dimensional}} nonlinear water waves generated by a steady or <b>oscillating</b> pressure <b>distribution</b> acting at the free surface of a running stream on water of finite depth h. The solutions of the corresponding linearized problems become singular depending on the relative values of the water depth, frequency, and {{the speed of the}} applied pressure leading to a resonant phenomenon. When the applied oscillatory pressure distribution moves at a resonant speed, the finite amplitude response is governed by the forced nonlinear Schrödinger (fNLS) equation. Under certain circumstances, the generated wave disturbance may not reach a steady state; in particular, for deep water, a steady state is never attained. For the case of a two-dimensional wave generated by a localized steady pressure moving at a resonant speed, the generated waves are actually of bounded amplitude and are governed by a forced Korteweg–de Vries (fKdV) equation subject to appropriate asymptotic initial conditions. A computational study of the forced KdV equation reveals that a series of solitons is generated in front of the pressure distribution. On the other hand, for the case of the three-dimensional waves induced by a localized steady pressure traveling at a resonant speed, the nonlinear response is governed by a forced Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (fKP) equation. In order to extend the range of applicability of the Boussinesq-type equations in the theory of water waves, the modified Boussinesq equations are derived in terms of the velocity potential on an arbitrary elevation and the free surface displacement...|$|R

The dynamic process, involving centrifugal forces due to the curved path of the trailing edge, {{is similar to the}} whipping of an oscil-lating rope, and accounts for most of the drag-force observed at the flagpole attachment (luff). Conversely, the induced tension, combined with the curva-ture of the fabric, opposes the pressure forces from the flow field and extracts momentum from it. In order to estimate post-critical flag and panel flutter amplitudes, it is necessary to compute the structural stiffening due to dy-namically induced tension. Tension in typical flag flutter motion, consisting of a traveling wave grow-ing in amplitude as is progresses towards the trailing edge (leech), is ob-tained by approximate analysis, using a Computer Algebra System. The time-averaged tension depends on the square of the velocity amplitude of the <b>oscillating</b> fabric; the <b>distribution</b> of time-averaged tension is shown for a typical flag flutter motion. An estimate of the tension fluctuations is devel-oped: the fluctuations are small (relative to the average tension) at locations several wavelengths from the leech, but are important near the leech. The general P. D. E. of motion is obtained from Hamilton’s principle. The induced-tension term in the governing P. D. E. derives from the in-plane ki-netic energy of the flag motion.

Especially, validation of satellite HCHO measurements is very difficult because ground-based HCHO measurements are extremely sparse. We use a new scientific approach, statistical analyses with empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and singular value decomposition (SVD), to provide three-dimensional results of comparisons with a global picture over long measurement periods. The EOF and SVD analyses with GOME, SCIAMACHY and OMI HCHO, and MOPITT CO show dipole <b>distributions</b> <b>oscillating</b> between northern and southern equatorial Africa with an annual cycle.
