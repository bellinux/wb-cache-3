25|$|The {{university}} receives applications {{mainly through}} UCAS and the Common Application {{with the latest}} figures showing that there are generally 12 applications per undergraduate place available.

In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively. The standard offer of a place tends to require five best Highers equivalent to AAAAB, three best A-levels equivalent to AAA or a score of at least 38 points on the International Baccalaureate. Successful entrants have, on average, 525 UCAS points (the equivalent of just above A*A*AA at A Level) ranking it as the 5th highest amongst higher education institutions in the UK for the 2015 admissions cycle with The Telegraph naming it as the hardest university to gain admission into in Scotland.|$|E

These findings were disputed in a re-analysis carried out for HEFCE which found that only Pakistani candidates were significantly less likely to receive offers (from both ‘old’ and ‘new’ universities). In this paper we return to the question of ethnic differences in university <b>offer</b> <b>rates,</b> examining UCAS admissions data for 2008. We use a cross-classified multi-level modelling approach to predict the probability that applications from candidates from different ethnic groups will receive an offer. Controlling for variables seeking to capture the academic quality of applications we find significant differences between <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> for different ethnic groups. Significantly lower <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> remained for the main ethnic groups when social characteristics were also taken into account in the model (social class background, gender and school type). However, <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> for candidates from mixed ethnic groups were not significantly different from those for white British candidates.
