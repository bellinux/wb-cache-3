40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{document}} the scale of Indigenous housing need as recorded {{in the most recent}} (2006) Census at a regional level and how this level of need changed between 2001 and 2006. What the results show is that the issue of Indigenous housing presents two challenges for government: catch-up and keep-up. Regarding ‘catch-up’, using an internationally recognised <b>occupancy</b> <b>standard,</b> the Indigenous population is still experiencing substantial overcrowding with the percentage living in overcrowded households 4. 8 times that of the non-Indigenous population. While the level of need is greatest in remote regions, to reduce the disparity between the two populations it is in capital city regions where the greatest number of houses would be required. There have been some improvements in absolute terms using a related measure since 2001, but the gap with non-Indigenous Australians is widening. Population growth presents the other dilemma in meeting Indigenous housing need [...] that is, the challenge of keeping-up...|$|E
40|$|Strategies {{to manage}} {{crowding}} in Indigenous households {{can reduce the}} negative effects for people living in those households, according to this report. Key Points 	Crowding in Indigenous households has structural causes, including the shortage of appropriately designed and affordable rental housing, and cultural causes, including visiting and sharing practices. 	Housing design that caters for large families and visitors would offer the opportunity of fulfilling cultural obligations to house visitors, alleviating some issues of crowding. 	While the Canadian National <b>Occupancy</b> <b>Standard</b> (CNOS) is currently used to measure crowding, it does not distinguish between those situations where crowding causes little stress and those where it does have negative effects for residents. 	Case studies revealed {{that the number of}} people living in the house was not the most significant trigger of stress but the lack of control over who stays and their behaviour. 	Locational differences were identified; with those interviewed in the regional centre case study areas (Mt Isa and Carnarvon) less likely to indicate they considered crowding or stress to be a problem. 	The most critical mediating factors for coping in large households are: firm administration of house rules by the householder, rules in organising sleeping space in large households and sharing visitors among other family households...|$|E
40|$|The ageing of Australia’s {{population}} {{has implications for}} the economy, social policy, community services and housing. This project focused on the efficiency of older residents’ homes, in particular, home owners. It offers greater understanding of how older home owners regard and utilise their housing and land, and their views about more ‘efficient’ alternatives. It also examined the role of housing and neighbourhood design in enabling people to remain living in their own homes. It found that despite the apparent under utilisation of their dwellings according to the commonly used Canadian National <b>Occupancy</b> <b>Standard,</b> the majority of older people regard their house as suitable for their needs. Extra bedrooms are used to accommodate temporary visitors and to pursue recreational activities. Older home owners expressed an overwhelming preference for remaining in their own homes, though approximately half {{would be prepared to}} live in housing specifically for older people. Few were prepared to live with their children. Based on this finding, a cost benefit analysis of three approaches to housing design to facilitate ageing in place was undertaken. Visitable design was the easiest and most cost effective to implement, whereas adaptable and universal design were more costly. The study highlighted the significance of neighbourhood design and the provision of appropriate public facilities to enable older people to maintain social participation and age in place...|$|E
40|$|Both {{long term}} and more recent socioeconomic, demographic, and {{cultural}} shifts {{have led to}} changing household formation patterns. Alongside a rise in living alone and adult children remaining in their parental homes have been increases in doubled-up or more-than-one-family households and non-family households. However, U. S. zoning codes and housing markets have long favored single-family homes and living arrangements. Have cities adapted to changing household trends? If so, how? Whether they have or not, what influences their responses? This thesis addresses these questions through a qualitative analysis of the occupancy standards- specifically family or household definitions, limits on the numbers of unrelated people in a single-family dwelling, and spatial requirements [...] of twenty-four {{cities across the country}} and deeper analysis of selected case studies. The findings show a range in approaches to relationship-based <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> that indicate some acknowledgement of different household structures, but most codes still favor traditional families defined by blood, marriage, or adoption. Both relationship- and space-based <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> are often supported for health and safety reasons or to "maintain neighborhood character," but these reasons and the typically selective enforcement of these codes often favor wealthier homeowners or have exclusionary intents and impacts. The discrepancies between <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> and household trends have important implications for the form, availability, and affordability of the current and future housing stock, neighborhood dynamics, and the housing security of households in cities nationwide. I argue that planners {{need to be aware of}} and resist the normative biases and assumptions about families and homes ingrained in most zoning codes and offer recommendations for planning practice with regards to <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> for single-family dwellings that support more flexible, equitable, and inclusive communities. by Amarillys Rodriguez.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 61) This {{study was}} {{an inquiry into}} the history of housing codes in search of the health reasons which led to the establishment of minimum room size and <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards.</b> The relationship between ventilation and space; standards and the relevance of existing standards were also considered. It was found that the early housing standards were borne out of arising social concern about the increased disease and death associated with the living conditions of the poor. The early space, <b>occupancy</b> and ventilation <b>standards</b> preceded the development of the germ theory. The germ theory apparently validated the early beliefs that respired air contained some harmful substance. The impact of modern medicine and improved sanitary measures have caused some housing experts to question the continued use of the early health rationale as a basis for the enforcement of some <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards.</b> The behavior of occupants rather than the number of occupants might be a more significant factor in the transmission of disease. The functional use of space and the influence of a variety of subjective factors were found to be of more concern to some housing investigators. Housing officials might also be influenced by subjective factors such as their own cultural, social and economic backgrounds. This may account for the opinion, by some experts, that housing standards tend to reflect a middle class response to the low income families??? needs. The author accepted the use of space standards for construction but rejected the use of fixed <b>standards</b> for <b>occupancy.</b> He promoted the concept that the social health and welfare of occupants should be the prime factor in establishing occupancy limits...|$|R

50|$|According to Eurostat, in 2011, 17.1% of EU {{population}} {{lived in}} overcrowded households by the above definition, {{with the number}} varying strongly between countries: the overcrowding rate stood at 43.1% in 12 newest member states compared to only 10.1% in 15 oldest members. Within the EU post-communist states, {{the extent to which}} the commodification of housing has improved <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> appeared to be modest. For instance, during 2005-2010 the percentage of overcrowded population in Romania and Latvia remained the highest in the EU (55%). Conversely, the Czech Republic showed the best performance in 2010, with overcrowding falling from 33% to 22% over the period, becoming lower than in Italy and Greece. In the remaining EU post-communist states, overcrowding fell moderately over the period, accounting for 35-49% in 2010. Lifecycle has remained a powerful determinant of overcrowding. Eastern Europeans aged under 18 are on average 2.5 times more likely to experience overcrowding than those aged over 65. Affordability problems of young adults, who had to delay home leaving, contributed to unrelenting overcrowding, but so did the legacy of a housing stock composed of many small dwellings. In the EU post-communist states, between 51-87% of dwellings had no more than three rooms.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the factors {{responsible for the}} growth of transport sector carbon dioxide emissions in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries during 1980 - 2005 by decomposing the emissions growth into components associated with changes in fuel mix, modal shift, and economic growth, as well as changes in emission coefficients and transportation energy intensity. The key finding of the study is that economic growth and the changes in transportation energy intensity are the main factors driving transport sector carbon dioxide emissions growth in the countries considered. The results imply that fiscal policy instruments - such as subsidies to clean fuels and clean vehicles - would be more effective in reducing emissions in countries where the economic activity effect is the primary driver for transport sector carbon dioxide emissions growth. By contrast, regulatory policy instruments - such as vehicle efficiency <b>standards</b> and vehicle <b>occupancy</b> <b>standards</b> - would be more effective in countries where the transportation energy intensity effect is the main driver of carbon dioxide emissions growth.

40|$|The Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is the UK Government’s {{approved}} {{methodology for}} assessing the energy ratings of dwellings. SAP is a calculation method based upon empirical relations from measured data. A yearly calculation was used in SAP until the release of SAP 2009, which employs monthly calculations. SAP has moved from using a large time step with a coarse time resolution to a smaller time step with a medium time resolution. Rising CO 2 emissions from dwellings advocate that properties designed in a sustainable method will become commonplace in the future. In tandem with enhanced sustainability, dwellings will increasingly be designed with implementations of renewable energy generation. The modelling of renewables in SAP has been highlighted as an area where SAP could benefit from additional research. Modelling future complex dwellings and systems will require an advanced calculation method which is capable of more detailed modelling and simulation; with a smaller time step which is measured in minutes and not months, producing results allowing more detailed analysis of energy performance. Dynamic Simulation Methods (DSMs) already exist which can operate at a very small time step. However with DSMs {{it is very difficult}} to make a comparison with SAP as the temperatures used in SAP are not well understood. To calculate energy consumption the SAP methodology guarantees that a <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> temperature profile is met perfectly. A dynamic method which also guarantees the SAP <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> temperature profile is required. This is difficult in complex DSMs as their control algorithms are often inadequate to optimise the heating system to guarantee that a temperature is met perfectly. The contribution to knowledge detailed in this thesis is the development of a novel SAP compliant advanced dynamic calculation method (IDEAS) v which guarantees that the SAP <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> temperature profile is perfectly tracked and is also calibrated with SAP. The Inverse Dynamics based Energy Assessment and Simulation (IDEAS) method employs the perfect inverse control law RIDE to guarantee that the SAP <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> temperature profile is met. IDEAS produces SAP compliant results and allows confident (i. e. calibrated in SAP) predictions to be made regarding the impact of novel heating and renewable energy systems. Researched in depth are the temperatures used in SAP, leading to analysis of the implications of tracking air temperature and various comfort temperatures. A focused evaluation of the treatment of renewables in SAP and DSMs is also presented, leading to suggestions which were implemented into the SAP framework. The role of real life monitoring in the energy assessment process is highlighted with monitored studies conducted. Also in this thesis case studies applying IDEAS to buildings with renewable heating systems are described. The IDEAS method employs SAP as an exemplar steady state calculation to highlight the successful use and calibration of a new advanced Inverse Dynamics based symbolic method. The philosophy, research and equations derived in IDEAS are presented in this thesis demonstrating their use in Microsoft Excel and Matlab / Simulink environments. The IDEAS methodology is transparent and portable. IDEAS can be applied to other methodologies, such as those employed by PHPP and SBEM (by carrying out a calibration process), and also to different simulation environments such as ESP-r and ESL (by adopting the IDEAS equations in those methods). The contribution to knowledge of IDEAS is demonstrated in this thesis by the development of the method and the use of SAP as a comparator. The IDEAS method has many uses outwith SAP which are highlighted in the cases studies and future work sections of this body of work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The HMM parameters are estimated offline using the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our model is better suited for representing reconfigurable environments than <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> grids. Furthermore, the results show that the explicit representation of the environment dynamics can be used to improve localization accuracy in reconfigurable environments. I...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} 1 - Occupancy estimates can inform biodiversity managers {{about the}} distribution of elusive species, such as the Pyrenean desman Galemys pyrenaicus, a small semi-aquatic mammal that lives along streams. Occupancy models rely on replication within a sampling site and provide estimates of the probability of detection. However, {{we still do not}} know how occupancy and detection estimates obtained from spatial vs. temporal replications differ or the appropriateness of using one or the other when cost and logistics make one approach prohibitive. Recently, the Markovian occupancy model has been developed to analyse adjacent spatial replicates and to test for spatial dependence between them. This model has already been applied to large and highly mobile mammals using trails, but never tested for any species with linear home ranges. 2 - We compared detection and occupancy estimates obtained from both temporal and spatial sampling designs that were subsequently organized into four data configurations (sites with both spatial and temporal replicates, adjacent spatial replicates only, temporal replicates only at the segment and site scales). From that, five occupancy models with different assumptions (the <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> model, the <b>standard</b> multiscale model, the multiscale model with Markovian process for detection, the Markovian detection model and the Markovian occupancy model) were used. We also assessed which occupancy model was the most appropriate for each data configuration to determine whether it is necessary to incorporate correlation into models. 3 - We found that the estimated detection probabilities were relatively high (≥ 0 · 58) and similar when the same model was applied to each data configuration. 4 - Spatial replication weakly underestimated occupancy. But when using this design, the Markovian occupancy model was the most supported and minimized the underestimation of occupancy, highlighting a spatial dependence between adjacent replicates. 5 - Synthesis and applications. We show that a survey based on adjacent spatial replicates for a mammal living along linear features of the landscape is a good compromise between cost and occupancy estimates, while using the Markovian occupancy model to estimate detection and occupancy. Our finding may have wider applications for the monitoring of species especially when temporal replicates are difficult or unrealistic. Spatial design, for surveys based on sign detection, could thus be applied for species with linear home ranges or when surveys are constrained by linear habitats...|$|R

However, recent research has documented large differences between actual and predicted energy consumption.

40|$|Energy {{is used in}} {{dwellings}} {{to provide}} four services: space heating, hot water, lighting and to power appliances. This paper describes how the usage of energy in a UK home results from a complex interaction between built form, location, energy-using equipment, occupants and the affordability of fuel. Current models with <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> predict that energy use will be strongly related to size and built form, but surveys of real homes show only weak correlations, across all types of dwelling. Recent research has given us insights into occupancy factors including preferred comfort, 'take-back' from thermal efficiency improvements, and patterns of electricity use. Space heating is on a downward trend and is low in new dwellings. Energy use for lights and appliances, which is only weakly related to built form, is increasing. Strong legislation, combined with low-carbon technologies, {{will be needed to}} counteract this trend. Future challenges discussed include increases in real energy prices and climate change mitigation efforts, which are likely to improve the existing stock. Challenging targets are now in place for new housing to move towards low or zero energy and carbon standards. In the longer term, dwellings will demand less energy. Alternatives to gas for space heating will be increasingly common, including ground source heat and local combined heat and power (CHP) from biomass, while electricity could come from a more decarbonised electricity system. However, these improvements must be set alongside a demand for many new homes, demographic trends towards smaller households, and a more holistic approach to overall carbon use including personal transport.

The aims and requirements of the European Directive on the Energy performance of Buildings and its implementation for new and existing domestic buildings is also considered, together with the new home-buying process due in 2007. Design/methodology/approach ? The requirements of Part L 1 A of the Building Regulations are developed. These relate to the thermal properties of the building fabric including insulation, thermal bridging, air tightness and glazing, the efficiency and responsiveness of heating and hot water systems, ventilation and lighting. The procedures for demonstrating compliance of a design for a new dwelling are demonstrated using the new NHER &# 60;IT&# 62;Plan Assessor&# 60;/IT&# 62; software. The methodology for calculating thermal transmittance coefficients (U-values) is also demonstrated with the aid of an example. Findings ? The changes in the Building Regulations will make new dwellings 20 per cent more efficient than current practice. The approach is now performance-based where the carbon dioxide emissions are considered for the whole building and there is some design flexibility. The U-value calculation is more accurate and allows for thermal bridging. The example demonstrated that in some cases the difference in U-values calculated can be small but where the bridging effect is large this would not be the case. Pressure testing will be virtually mandatory and will have the effect of improving the air tightness of dwellings. Originality/value ? This paper identifies the main changes in Part L 1 A and the implications for designers and other professionals who will be involved with compliance issues. Guidance is also given on how compliance might be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A {{storm surge}} is the sudden rise of sea {{water over the}} astronomical tides, {{generated}} by an approaching storm. This event poses {{a major threat to}} the Philippine coastal areas, as manifested by Typhoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013. This hydro-meteorological hazard {{is one of the main}} reasons for the high number of casualties due to the typhoon, with 6300 deaths. It became evident that the need to develop a storm surge inundation map is of utmost importance. To develop these maps, the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-Project NOAH) simulated historical tropical cyclones that entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The Japan Meteorological Agency storm surge model was used to simulate storm surge heights. The frequency distribution of the maximum storm surge heights was calculated using simulation results of tropical cyclones under a specific public storm warning signal (PSWS) that passed through a particular coastal area. This determines the storm surge height corresponding to a given probability of occurrence. The storm surge heights from the model were added to the maximum astronomical tide data from WXTide software. The team then created maps of inundation for a specific PSWS using the probability of exceedance derived from the frequency distribution. Buildings and other structures were assigned a probability of exceedance depending on their occupancy category, i. e., 1 % probability of exceedance for critical facilities, 10 % probability of exceedance for special occupancy structures, and 25 % for <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> and miscellaneous structures. The maps produced show the storm-surge-vulnerable areas in Metro Manila, illustrated by the flood depth of up to 4 m and extent of up to 6. 5 km from the coastline. This information can help local government units in developing early warning systems, disaster preparedness and mitigation plans, vulnerability assessments, risk-sensitive land use plans, shoreline defense efforts, and coastal protection measures. These maps can also determine the best areas to build critical structures, or at least determine the level of protection of these structures should they be built in hazard areas. Moreover, these will support the local government units' mandate to raise public awareness, disseminate information about storm surge hazards, and implement appropriate countermeasures for a given PSWS...|$|R
40|$|Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models {{provide a}} {{flexible}} way to model species 2 ̆ 7 habitat <b>occupancy</b> status, but <b>standard</b> CART algorithms {{have plenty of}} room for extensions. One such extension explores the survey error of imperfect detection. When an individual is not detected, that is often taken as sign of non-presence. However, the principle of imperfect detection tells us that just because one cannot find what they are looking for, {{that does not mean that}} what they are looking for is not present. We outline four methods for including detection probability in the process of growing the tree, and illustrate these methods using data from a study of mountain plovers (Dinsmore et al. 2003). The results depend on the method used to estimate detection and occupancy. For the mountain plover data, the tree structures produced by three of the methods are identical to that produced by the naive tree in which detection is ignored. The fourth method yields different splitting choices. Estimates of occupancy probability are consistently lower when using the naive tree than those computed using detection-adjusted trees. Accounting for imperfect detection is crucial even when occupancy is modeled using a CART tree. In addition to imperfect detection, another extension to standard CART algorithms deals with spatial correlation. Many studies include a cluster-type sampling design where there is a clear spatial correlation between sampling locations. This correlation causes the variance of the node occupancy estimates in CART to be biased. We suggest a generalized estimating equation (GEE) -based approach in which the naive variance estimates (calculated as if all locations were independent) are 2 ̆ 2 corrected 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 based on the data available in each parent node of the tree. The corrected variance estimates are then used to revise the binary-split decision criterion of the tree. The variances of each node in the split are assumed to be unequal. We demonstrate this method using data from a study on rats and also from a study on bird occurrences in Oregon. When creating alternative methods of growing trees (i. e. how nodes are split) in CART, we expect to see [potentially] different trees. However, using those new methods also means that methodology involved in pruning the trees may need their own corresponding changes. For example, both of the types of methodology proposed above, incorporating imperfect detection and correlated data, led to an examination of current pruning criteria. Taking both of those new algorithms into account, we will discuss several pruning criteria that could be used in conjunction with our proposed CART methodology. We evaluated the performance of each criteria by using simulated examples for each criteria, which resulted in error rates that were used to assess the performance of the pruning criteria...|$|R
40|$|I used {{results from}} camera traps set for tigers (Panthera tigris) during 2001 - 2011 in the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary of {{northern}} Myanmar to assess overall biodiversity of large mammal and bird species, {{and to identify}} differences in photo rates {{inside and outside of}} the most protected core area of the Sanctuary. A total of 403 camera stations were deployed during October-July in the dry seasons of 2001 - 2011, 260 inside the Core area and 143 Outside. From 10, 750 trap-nights I obtained 2, 077 independent photos of wildlife species and 699 of domestic animals and humans, including 35 species of wild mammals (19 carnivores, 4 primates, 1 elephant, 6 even-toed ungulates, 1 pangolin, and 4 rodents) and 16 species of wild birds. Of these, 1 is considered critically endangered, 7 are endangered, 11 are vulnerable, and 5 are nearly threatened. Some species that probably occur in the Sanctuary (e. g., arboreal or semi-aquatic mammals) were not photographed, likely because of camera placement. In total, 48 wild species were photographed in the Core area vs. only 33 at locations Outside of the core area. Generally, few photos of any domestic animal species were obtained inside 9 the Core area, and no photos insurgents were obtained there, but many more photos of poachers and villagers, but also park rangers, were obtained there. Increased patrol efforts may have helped maintain species presence in the Core area, but differences in photo rates between areas were likely mostly influenced by differences in elevation, slope, density of streams, trails, and roads, and perhaps vegetative cover type. Tiger abundance is most influenced naturally by prey availability and anthropogenically by poaching. In the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Myanmar, a major conservation area established to protect tigers, tiger presence has declined. This study was conducted to assess habitat occupancy and distribution of principal tiger prey species in the Core part of the Sanctuary by surveying for sign on 1650. 9 km partitioned into 554 sampling units during November 2007 and May 2008. Using <b>standard</b> <b>occupancy</b> model in the program PRESENCE (6. 2), habitat occupancy and detection probabilities were predicted and the best candidate model for each species was selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). By incorporating 7 environmental and 4 social covariates, the predicted habitat occupancy rates were 0. 76 (SE= 0. 196, naïve estimate = 0. 5162) for gaur (Bos gaurus), 0. 91 (SE= 0. 03, naïve estimate = 0. 7762) for sambar (Rusa unicolor), 0. 57 (SE = 0. 003, naïve estimate = 0. 3195) for wild pigs (Sus scrofa) and 0. 89 (SE = 0. 001, naïve estimate = 0. 7996) for muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak). Overall, shorter Euclidean distances to ranger stations and trails, decreased stream density, and broadleaved evergreen/semi-deciduous forest and relatively rare rain-fed cropland habitat occurrence positively influenced prey habitat occupancy; conversely, shorter Euclidean distances to villages, roads, and streams, higher elevations, and occurrence of mixed broadleaved and needle-leaved forest habitat 10 negatively influenced occupancy. In addition, Euclidean distance to ranger stations, trails, and roads positively affections species detections, whereas shorter Euclidean distance to villages and streams, high elevations, and high precipitation negatively affected detections. Results indicate that all four prey species were relatively well-distributed through the Sanctuary Core area. However, comparisons with tiger and prey indices of abundance elsewhere suggest that prey density is low and would not likely support many tigers...|$|R
