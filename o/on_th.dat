Janine Schaults from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the track, {{claiming that the}} [...] "rousing duet [...] destined for hitsville", with her thanking Stefani for [...] "com in to save the day" [...] with her [...] "pouty vocals". Erlewine from AllMusic thought the song would qualify as [...] "an adult contemporary hit". Scott Stroud from The National favored it for being [...] "the least subtle" [...] of the [...] "hard-to-miss observations from his high-profile personal life". Mikael Wood, writing for Los Angeles Times, praised the collaboration, stating that Stefani provides [...] "the most striking lyrical moment on If I'm Honest", declaring it a [...] "handsome duet". Jessica Mule from Renowned for Sound selected the recording as [...] "an obvious track choice for the album", and complimented it for [...] "be quite captivating as they both play off each others own experiences".

[...] Cuse correctly guessed Ken Leung, who had guest starred as one-time character Carter Chong, a young and angry mental patient. [...] In mid-May, they contacted Leung's agent and were informed in July that he was available and interested in working on Lost. [...] To limit the leak of spoilers, Lindelof and Cuse auditioned Leung with a character and scene created specifically for the audition that would not be used in the show but was [...] "analogous to the role [...] really want." [...] Leung believed that he was auditioning for the role of Russell, a [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] in his late thirties with immense knowledge across various scientific fields, limited social skills and broken personal relationships. [...] Leung was the only actor who tried out for this part, as writers had written the role of Miles for him; had he not accepted the job, the character would have been completely rewritten. [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom' [...] ".|$|E

Materials and Methods. The complex clinical and paraclinical study of 77 patients (the average age 57, 9 ± 0, 9 years) was done in the early recovery period of the CIHS. The study of all patients was complex clinic and paraclinical: test according to National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was done <b>on</b> the 10 <b>th,</b> 30 th, 90 th and 180 th day of the disease; computer tomography of cerebrum was made {{on the first day of}} the disease; melatonin serum concentration and serotonin plasma level were determined <b>on</b> the 10 <b>th</b> and 30 th day from the onset of the CIHS. The melatonin/serotonin ratio (MSR = melatonin serum concentration / serotonin plasma level) was also calculated. Results and Discussion. Statistical reliable relations between the following indications have been identified: «serotonin plasma level <b>on</b> the 10 <b>th</b> day - dynamics mRS score on the 30 - 90 th day» (R=+ 0, 37, p˂ 0, 05), «melatonin serum concentration <b>on</b> the 10 <b>th</b> day - dynamics mRS score on the 30 - 90 th day» (R=- 0, 23, p˂ 0, 05),«MSR <b>on</b> the 10 <b>th</b> day - dynamics mRS score on the 30 - 90 th day» (R=- 0, 40, p˂ 0, 05),«serotonin plasma level <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - BI score <b>on</b> the 90 <b>th</b> day»(R=+ 0, 38, p˂ 0, 05),«serotonin plasma level <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> - BI score <b>on</b> the 180 <b>th</b> day»(R=+ 0, 40, p˂ 0, 05), «MSR <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - NIHSS score <b>on</b> the 180 <b>th</b> day» (R=+ 0, 29, p˂ 0, 05), «MSR <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - mRS score <b>on</b> the 90 <b>th</b> day» (R=+ 0, 29, p˂ 0, 05), «MSR <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - mRS score <b>on</b> the 180 <b>th</b> day» (R=+ 0, 32, p˂ 0, 05), «MSR <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - BI score <b>on</b> the 90 <b>th</b> day» (R=- 0, 42, p˂ 0, 05), «MSR <b>on</b> the 30 <b>th</b> day - BI score <b>on</b> the 180 <b>th</b> day» (R=- 0, 32, p˂ 0, 05).

40|$|Sertoli cell (SC) number determines testes {{size and}} their {{capacity}} to produce spermatozoa. In the rat SC proliferate until 15 th postnatal day (PND). Their proliferation is stimulated by FSH and inhibited by estradiol, but the role for androgens is uncertain. In this study we analyzed the effects of testosterone administration on testes growth and SC number in relation to timing of the treatment. Male rats were injected with 2. 5 mg of testosterone propionate (TP) from birth until 5 th PND and autopsied either <b>on</b> 6 <b>th</b> PND [TP 1 - 5 (6) ] or <b>on</b> 16 <b>th</b> PND [TP 1 - 5 (16) ] (transient administration). Other rats received TP from birth until 15 th PND [TP 1 - 15] or between 5 th and 15 th PND [TP 5 - 15] continuously and were autopsied <b>on</b> day 16 <b>th.</b> Control groups (C) received vehicle. In the Cs serum level of estradiol was 20 -fold higher (p< 0. 001) and FSH was 1, 7 -fold higher (p< 0. 05) <b>on</b> 6 <b>th</b> PND than <b>on</b> 16 <b>th</b> PND, while testosterone did not change. After TP blood level of testosterone increased 2200 -fold <b>on</b> 6 <b>th</b> PND (p< 0. 05), and 8 -fold <b>on</b> 16 <b>th</b> PND. In turn, continuous TP administrations resulted <b>on</b> 16 <b>th</b> PND in the increase in testosterone serum level by 2000 -times of C without influence on FSH. While the treatment from birth either during initial 5 days or continuously until 15 th day decreased testicular weight (p< 0. 001), tubule length (p< 0. 05) and SC number (p< 0. 001), the treatment initiated <b>on</b> 5 <b>th</b> PND had no effects. TP reduced serum estradiol level <b>on</b> 6 <b>th</b> PND by 13 -fold (p< 0. 01), but doubled it <b>on</b> 16 <b>th</b> PND. Conclusion: Neonatal rats secrete estradiol and FSH in the amounts greatly extending those presented during further development. Testosterone inhibits testicular growth and SC number acting during first 5 neonatal days by decreasing FSH secretion, but is not effective during further development. Direct inhibitory influence of testosterone or trough its increased aromatisation to estradiol beyond neonatal period {{may be responsible for}} sustained inhibition of testes growth and SC number during infancy...|$|R
