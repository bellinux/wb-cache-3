Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E

During a pope's visit, the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags, and white and blue Marian flags. It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions, such as birthdays or weddings.|$|E

5|$|Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a Criollo who was the alcalde of Bacalar (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E

Ranjitsinhji did not take it particularly seriously and preferred tennis at the time.

25|$|Meanwhile, Kendricks {{dominated}} the Nationals, taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> effective changeup, and Washington hitters proved unable {{to adjust to}} his mid-80s fastball. He gave up a single to Harper {{in the first and}} a single to center fielder Michael A. Taylor in the second and, like Strasburg, left the game after the seventh inning, having shut out Washington on two hits (only one of which left the infield), three walks, a hit batsman, and six strikeouts. Other than Harper′s single, he silenced the heart of the Nationals′ lineup; Anthony Rendon, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, second baseman Daniel Murphy, shortstop Trea Turner, and left fielder Jayson Werth went a combined 0-for-17 against him.|$|E
25|$|The modern all-male kabuki, {{known as}} yarō-kabuki (young man kabuki), was {{established}} during these decades. After women were banned from performing, cross-dressed male actors, known as onnagata ("female-role") or oyama, took over. Young (adolescent) men were preferred for women's roles {{due to their}} less masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices compared to adult men. In addition, wakashū (adolescent male) roles, played by young men often selected for attractiveness, became common, and were often presented in an erotic context. Along with {{the change in the}} performer's gender came a change in the emphasis of the performance: increased stress was placed on drama rather than dance. Performances were equally ribald, and the male actors too were available for prostitution (to both female and male customers). Audiences frequently became rowdy, and brawls occasionally broke out, sometimes over the favors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> handsome young actor, leading the shogunate to ban first onnagata and then wakashū roles. Both bans were rescinded by 1652.|$|E
25|$|Military history {{during this}} period paralleled the rise and {{eventual}} fall of the armored knight. Following Charlemagne, {{there was a great}} increase in the proportion of cavalry supplemented by improvement in armor: leather and steel, steel helmets, coats of mail, and even full armor added to the defensive capabilities of mounted forces. Cavalry eventually grew {{to be the most important}} component of armies from French territories, with the shock charge they provided becoming the standard tactic on the battlefield when it was invented in the 11th century. At the same time, the development of agricultural techniques allowed the nations of Western Europe to radically increase food production, facilitating the growth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>particularly</b> large aristocracy under Capetian France. The rise of castles, which began in France during the 10th century, was partly caused by the inability of centralized authorities to control these emerging dukes and aristocrats. After campaigns designed for plundering, attacking and defending castles became the dominant feature of medieval warfare.|$|E
