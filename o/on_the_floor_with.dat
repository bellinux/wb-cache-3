5|$|A Team D.A.D.D.Y. {{directed}} {{music video}} {{was made to}} accompany the track's release as a single. The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. Two different endings for the video were produced - in one Santa Claus is shown crucified on a cross while another sees Santa laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a spoilt child opening {{numerous}} Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens {{and a copy of}} Hey Venus! (which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E

5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E

He added 14.933 on rings, 15.633 on the vault, scored 15.833 on the {{parallel}} bars and finished off on the high bar with 15.100, an apparatus {{he had taken a}} fall on just a few days before in the team competition.|$|E
25|$|Tumbling, {{also known}} as power tumbling, is an acrobatic {{discipline}} which combines some of the skills of artistic gymnastics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> those of trampolining. It is practised on a 25-metre long spring track (also called a tumbling track or rod floor). It was developed from tumbling performances performed by entertainers from very early times but as a sport is now codified, regulated and judged and performed using standardised special equipment.|$|E

25|$|When {{dining in}} a {{traditional}} tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels.|$|E
25|$|The primary work {{is between}} mother and therapist. It {{is based on the}} notion of the infant as {{initiator}} in infant–parent psychotherapy. For half the session the mother gets down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> the infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{service is}} subject to {{overcrowding}} during rush hours. To help alleviate this, the operator introduced a new queuing system to help passengers line up when the trains are coming. The lines are painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> three colour codes representing each of the train set. The system was first implemented at KL Sentral station on 17 October 2008. The operator is also considering introducing express services between Sungai Buloh and Kajang stations and between Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam station during rush hours {{by the end of}} 2008.|$|E

25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of date-presses (madbassat) are found in houses {{throughout}} the town. They are small rooms with ridged plastered floors sloping to one corner where a jar would have been placed. Dates were packed in sacks and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> weights on top to squeeze out the date juice - a sweet sticky syrup (dibs). The jar would collect and preserve the syrup for later consumption or use in cooking. In 2014, a site was excavated which revealed the largest yet-discovered date-pressing site {{in the country and}} region. There were 27 date presses found overall, including 11 found in one lone complex.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of the country milk is offered along with {{crystallized}} sugar, rice pudding (kheer in local parlance). A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes {{to come out of the}} anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.|$|E

25|$|On January 23, 1991, Petrović {{became a}} member of the New Jersey Nets. He joined a team that had not reached the playoffs since 1986, but had rookie Derrick Coleman, the number one {{selection}} from the 1990 draft. He was immediately given a role <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> 20.5 minutes per game. His scoring over the remaining 43 games increased to 12.6 points per game, one of the league's best points-per-minute ratios. The following year, he and Coleman were joined by Kenny Anderson, giving the team a third talented new addition. Petrović was made a starter for the 1991–92 season, his first full season with the Nets. Petro, as the Americans had dubbed him, did not miss a single game. His determination, hard work and aggressive on court demeanor established him as a team leader. In 36.9 minutes on the floor he averaged 20.6 points. Petrovic led the Nets in field-goal shooting and free-throw shooting, and his field goal percentage of 51% placed him near the top of all NBA guards. More importantly, his success translated into success for the team. The Nets made the playoffs, recording 14 more wins than the previous year. The following season saw Petrović increase his scoring average to 22.3 ppg, 11th best in the league. On December 6, he was named MVP of the Week. For the second season in a row he shot 45% from the three-point arc. His field goal percentage of 52% was again near the top for all guards. American media honored him with a selection to the All-NBA Third Team. However, he did not receive an invitation to the 1993 All-Star game. Among the top 13 scorers in the NBA that season, he was the only one not invited.|$|E
500|$|In July 1960, the Sunday newspaper, The People, ran {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Beatnik Horror" [...] that featured a photograph {{taken in the}} flat below Sutcliffe's of a teenaged Lennon lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> Sutcliffe standing by a window. As they had often visited the Jacaranda club, its owner, Allan Williams, arranged for the photograph to be taken, subsequently taking over from Sutcliffe to book concerts for the group: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe. The Beatles' subsequent name change came during an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe, Lennon and his girlfriend, Cynthia Powell, thought up names similar to Holly's band, the Crickets, {{and came up with}} Beetles. Lennon later changed the name because he thought it sounded French, suggesting Le Beat or Beat-less.|$|E
500|$|When {{assessing}} Lady Rosebery's behaviour to {{her children}} {{it should be remembered}} that she lived in an era of plentiful nannies, wet nurses, nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention {{to her children}} was not unusual– she was following the upper class conventions and [...] "stiff upper lip" [...] philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences from their children, the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. Margot Asquith records how Rosebery loved to play and romp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> the children.|$|E
