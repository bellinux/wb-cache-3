40|$|<b>Oxmetidine,</b> at {{concentrations}} {{in excess of}} 1 X 10 (- 6) M, caused concentration-dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic responses in guinea-pig isolated heart preparations. <b>Oxmetidine,</b> at {{concentrations in}} excess of 1 X 10 (- 5) M, caused negative inotropic responses in guinea-pig papillary muscle preparations. The negative inotropic responses to <b>oxmetidine</b> were associated with shortening of the plateau phase of the action potential. Verapamil and nifedipine caused similar shortening of the plateau phase of the action potential at equivalent negative inotropic concentrations indicating that <b>oxmetidine</b> may also act as a calcium antagonist. In preparations partially depolarized by raising extracellular K+ concentration, <b>oxmetidine</b> also exhibited negative inotropic activity and reduced the calcium-dependent action potential. However, unlike verapamil and nifedipine, <b>oxmetidine</b> did not show voltage-dependent activity. <b>Oxmetidine,</b> at concentrations in excess of 1 X 10 (- 5) M, inhibited Ca 2 +-dependent contractions of dog saphenous vein preparations and inhibited 45 Ca 2 +-uptake into veins depolarized by high extracellular K+. In vivo, these calcium antagonist actions of <b>oxmetidine</b> were demonstrated by vasodilatation, reduction in blood pressure, bradycardia and reduced cardiac output in anaesthetized cats. <b>Oxmetidine,</b> at concentrations of 1 X 10 (- 5) M and above, shows properties consistent with inhibition of transmembrane Ca 2 + flux. This action can be distinguished from other calcium antagonists as the effects of <b>oxmetidine</b> are not voltage-dependent...|$|E
40|$|The gastric antisecretory {{effects of}} <b>oxmetidine,</b> a new H 2 -receptor antagonist, {{have been studied}} in 33 healthy subjects. The {{relative}} potency of <b>oxmetidine</b> {{compared with that of}} cimetidine depended on the route of administration and the experimental conditions. <b>Oxmetidine</b> intravenously infused was approximately four times as potent as cimetidine, weight for weight, in inhibiting impromidine stimulated gastric acid secretion but was twice as potent when food was used as a stimulus. After oral administration there were no differences in the weight-for-weight potency of <b>oxmetidine</b> and cimetidine, although <b>oxmetidine</b> was twice as potent on a molar basis. These apparent differences according to the route of drug administration are probably due to first pass metabolism of <b>oxmetidine.</b> There were no differences in the duration of action of <b>oxmetidine</b> and cimetidine. Twenty-four hour monitoring of intragastric pH showed that <b>oxmetidine</b> 400 mg twice daily reduced mean hourly 24 hour intragastric pH by 59 %, suggesting that a twice daily dosage regimen should be evaluated in the treatment of duodenal ulceration...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of a single bedtime dose of H 2 -receptor antagonist in the healing of duodenal ulcer, a 12 -week randomized double-blind controlled trial of <b>oxmetidine,</b> which is equipotent to cimetidine and has a similar duration of action, was performed in 80 patients. <b>Oxmetidine,</b> 600 mg bedtime, resulted in significantly more complete healing than placebo at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 as assessed endoscopically. At weeks 4 and 6, 72. 5 % and 85 %, respectively, of ulcers were completely healed by <b>oxmetidine,</b> and 36. 8 % and 41. 7 %, respectively, by placebo. Of 45 prospectively obtained patient characteristics, high pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output and large ulcer diameter significantly affected healing adversely. These results indicate that duodenal ulcer healing may be achieved by reducing the nocturnal acid secretion alone. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>oxmetidine</b> 800 mg/day, a new {{histamine}} H 2 -receptor antagonist, on duodenal ulcer healing was compared with cimetidine 1000 mg/day in a two-centre double-blind trial. Ninety-nine patients completed the study. After four weeks, ulcers were healed in 74 % of the cimetidine-treated patients and in 78 % of the oxmetidine-treated patients (p greater than 0. 05). Healing rates after eight weeks increased to 90 % in the cimetidine group and to 94 % in the <b>oxmetidine</b> group. Healing rates after four weeks were, however, {{different in the}} two centres (p less than 0. 01) : in centre 1 88 % of the cimetidine-treated, but 63 % of the oxmetidine-treated patients healed, in centre 2 rates were 60 % (cimetidine) and 92 % (<b>oxmetidine).</b> Analysis of patient data revealed that in the two centres treatment success was inversely correlated (p less than 0. 01) with the percentage of smokers in each treatment group. Smoking significantly influences duodenal ulcer healing with histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Agonist-antagonist {{interactions}} at histamine receptors {{have been}} re-examined using improved techniques, on the mouse isolated, lumen-perfused, stomach gastric acid assay. Using histamine as agonist, pKB values have been estimated for burimamide, metiamide, cimetidine, ranitidine, <b>oxmetidine</b> and famotidine {{on both the}} gastric and guinea-pig isolated right atrium assays. With the exception of <b>oxmetidine</b> on the atrial assay, these compounds behaved as competitive antagonists on both assays. <b>Oxmetidine</b> significantly depressed basal rate on the atrial assay and the Schild plot slope parameter (0. 81) was significantly less than one. The pKB values estimated on the gastric assay were lower than those on the atrial assay. However, {{the difference between the}} values on the gastric and atrial assays was not constant. The difference between the two assays for famotidine was not significant. We conclude that the apparent varying selectivity of the antagonists for gastric and atrial histamine H 2 -receptors may be explained by the differential loss of antagonists into the gastric secretion from the receptor compartment and that {{there is no need to}} postulate heterogeneity of histamine H 2 -receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{different}} H 2 -receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine and <b>oxmetidine)</b> were tested on isolated preparations of guinea-pig trachea and human bronchus against contractions induced by acetylcholine, histamine and potassium chloride (KCl). In addition, their influence on calcium concentration-response curves in guinea-pig tracheal spirals was examined in a potassium-rich solution (30 mM). Finally, their effects were studied in vivo against acetylcholine and histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. In guinea-pig isolated trachea, <b>oxmetidine</b> [...] in contrast to cimetidine and ranitidine, which were completely inactive [...] induced a concentration-dependent relaxation regardless of the excitatory stimulus: its [...] log EC 50 values (i. e. the negative log concentration that caused a 50 % relaxation) were 3. 46 +/- 0. 11, 4. 61 +/- 0. 09 and 4. 20 +/- 0. 12 against acetylcholine, histamine and KCl, respectively. In Ca 2 +-free, K+-enriched solution, the compound was able to inhibit Ca 2 +-induced contractions at concentrations close to those needed to counteract the spasmogenic effect of histamine in normal Krebs solution. Results obtained in the human bronchus preparation {{were similar to those}} observed in guinea-pig tracheal spirals. When tested against acetylcholine or histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo, <b>oxmetidine</b> (10 and 30 mg Kg- 1 intravenously) significantly reduced the increase in pulmonary airway resistance (Raw) induced by both agents. Once again, cimetidine and ranitidine were completely ineffective. In summary, <b>oxmetidine</b> displayed non-specific antispasmogenic activity on guinea-pig and human airways. This effect, which is independent of H 2 -receptor blockade, represents a side-effect of the drug which may be connected to its interference with Ca 2 + influx and the action or release of intracellular Ca 2 +...|$|E

40|$|The {{histamine}} H,-receptor antagonist SK&F 93479 induced gastric neuroendocrine (carcinoid) ECL-cell tumor {{formation in}} 6 / 34 male and 8 / 37 female rats treated for 22 - 24 months at 1, 000 mg/kg/day PO. Focal ECL-cell hyperplasia {{was present in}} 21 / 34 males and 15 / 37 females, with local infiltration through the muscularis mucosae in half these cases. No focal hyperplasias or carcinoids were present after 200 m@g/ day PO treatment. Investigative studies showed evidence for marked and sustained hypergastrinemia in-creasing on chronic dosing which was capable of restoring gastric acid secretion and pH to near control values. Using morphometric analysis of immunoperoxidase anti-chromogranin A stained sections, a dose-related and time-dependent neuroendocrine ECLcell hyperplasia was correlated with the sustained elevated hypergastrinemia. A 2 l-month mouse oncogenicity study showed no focal neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia or carcinoid tumor induction, but a diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia {{and an increase in}} multifocal glandular hyperplasia of the oxyntic mucosa was observed in mice treated with 1, 000 m a g SK&F 93479 PO. The morphological changes observed in both rat and mouse were considered to be secondary to the hypergastrinemia resulting from the pharmacological suppression of gastric acid secretion by SK&F 93479. These changes were also observed to a more marked degree following omeprazole treatment and were only slight following <b>oxmetidine</b> treatment in the rat...|$|E
