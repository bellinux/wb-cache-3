They attracted a particularly strong following among local {{chapters of the}} Hells Angels and got a recurring gig {{at one of the}} bikers' favorite venues, the Chateau Liberté in the Santa Cruz mountains, and they continued playing the Chateau through the summer of 1975 (although some of these concerts did not include all band members and they were unannounced and of an impromptu nature). An energetic set of demos (eight of which were briefly and illegally released on Pickwick Records in 1980 under the title Introducing the Doobie Brothers, and have since been bootlegged on CD under that title and <b>On</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Way</b> Up as well, both with expanded song selections), showcased fuzz-toned dual lead electric guitars, three-part harmonies and Hartman's frenetic drumming and earned the rock group a contract at Warner Bros.

25|$|In 1920, {{after the}} end of the First World War, Sassoon {{returned}} to Baghdad from Istanbul and was appointed Minister of Finance in the first Iraqi government, a new provisional government under the premiership of Abd Al-Rahman Al-Naqib. The importance of his role was what was to make or break the new constitution of Iraq. The details of this were highlighted by Gertrude Bell when she recounted the circumstances regarding the establishment of Iraq’s new government. Dated 1 November 1920, Bell wrote:“On Wednesday morning all seemed to be going well. In the afternoon Major Yetts and I went out sightseeing in Baghdad and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> home dropped in to tea with the Tods. Mr Tod sprung upon us that he had called on Sasun Eff to congratulate him on his becoming Minister of Finance and found him with Hamdi Pasha Baban (who had been offered a seat in the Cabinet without portfolio,) both in the act of refusing. Mr Tod had done his best to persuade them but had heard in the afternoon that they had refused, the real, though not the expressed reason, being that they would not join a Cabinet which contained Saiyid Talib.|$|E

[...] However, Lowell did participate in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. against the war {{and was one of the}} featured speakers at the event.

2500|$|Blake {{was given}} {{command of the}} gunboat [...] {{stationed}} in the James River, engaged in transporting troops and in occasional engagements with the enemy. The {{most important of these}} was on 24 January 1865, when a powerful Confederate squadron launched an attack on the Union blockade of the river at Trent's Reach. Sailing downriver the Confederate force drove away the Union pickets, and commenced removing the boom and obstructions. William A. Parker, the Union naval commander, instead protecting the defences, retired and allowed them to be removed, leaving a clear passage for the enemy. However, two rams went aground, and the Confederates had to wait until high water the following night before proceeding. On the morning of the 25th, Parker was relieved of his command and Blake was made temporary commander of the naval division. Blake ordered the monitor [...] to put herself into a position within the range of enemy batteries, such that, if sunk, she would take the place of the removed obstructions. Subsequent attacks by Union ships and shore batteries sank two and badly damaged six of the Confederate ships, who eventually withdrew. After dark a party from Eutaw, commanded by Acting-Ensign Thomas Morgan boarded the abandoned [...] and re-floated her, finding her not as damaged as believed. In a letter Admiral David Dixon Porter wrote to Blake, [...] "Had your predecessor done as well, we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy, and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to Richmond."
