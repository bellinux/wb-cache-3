The supersoldier Master Chief is stowed away aboard an ancient Forerunner ship. On a course set for Earth, he is overwhelmed by a Covenant strike force and rendered unconscious.

Watts and the police investigate Ingram's home, finding the eyeless body of the dead trial participant and sachets <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Smooth Time", which they ascertain to be the nightmarish enantiomer of Proloft. Watts and the Millennium Group receive news that workers at a city office building are rioting and panicking. Black realizes that Ingram had been distributing [...] "Smooth Time" [...] {{under the guise of}} a sweetener in order to drug a large number of people. Tracking Ingram to the office building's surveillance room, Black learns that the doctor believes that the country's dependence on antidepressants has created a nation of [...] "zombies", and he is attempting to [...] "wake them up" [...] with violent hallucinogens. The doctor is arrested and taken into custody.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Cohen responded via {{his regular}} Washington Post column {{published}} on February 6, 2007. Cohen {{noted that he}} has dedicated more than 90 columns to condemning antisemitism since he started as a columnist in 1976, [...] "most of them full-throated condemnations of the hatred that killed fully one-third of all Jews during my lifetime. So it comes as a surprise that has {{the force of a}} mugging to be accused of aiding the very people I so hate – of being an abettor <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> The New Anti-Semitism." [...] Cohen wrote that the report [...] "has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure or, from someone like Reinharz, the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations – anti-Semite – is diluted beyond recognition. The offense here is not just to a handful of relatively unimportant writers, but to memory itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term may be spelled with {{or without}} a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some {{scholars}} favor the unhyphenated form because, [...] "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" [...] whereas [...] "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that." [...] For example, Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to [...] " [...] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes." [...] Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at Merrimack College; Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and James Carroll, historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on [...] "the existence <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> 'Semitism'", [...] "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that {{is at the heart of}} the problem of antisemitism".|$|E
6000|$|It {{would be}} like {{counting}} the bacteria of an infection to trace how ideas of insubordination came drifting into Sir Isaac's Paradise. The epidemic is in the air. There is no Tempter nowadays, no definitive apple. The disturbing force has grown subtler, blows in now like a draught, creeps and gathers like the dust,--a disseminated serpent. Sir Isaac brought home his young, beautiful and rather crumpled and astonished Eve and by all his standards he was entitled to be happy ever afterwards. He knew of one danger, but against {{that he was very}} watchful. Never once for six long years did she have a private duologue with another male. But Mudie and Sir Jesse Boot sent parcels to the house unchecked, the newspaper drifted in not even censored: the nurses who guided Ellen through the essential incidents of a feminine career talked <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "movement." [...] And there was Georgina....|$|E

Each qashmal vanishes after carrying out its task or if it failed in the attempt, and they never try again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}}, my friends, between Israel and the Arab {{world is}} the difference between civilization and barbarism.

And in the name <b>of</b> <b>something</b> they <b>call</b> [...] "Allah" [...] which {{is very different from the}} God we believe... applause because our God is the God of love.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} case, one {{may have a}} {{representation}} of a Monday (or at least <b>of</b> <b>something</b> one <b>calls</b> a Monday), as well as <b>of</b> <b>something</b> black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, {{there can be a}} circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this is a}} wide {{step from}} the happy {{optimism}} of the Cambridge days. What becomes of the sanctity of marriage and {{the institution of the}} family when respectable gentlemen talk <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> [...] "True Marriage," [...] as non-existent in relation to a lady who is already the mother of four children? I record this lapsing of Mr. Brumley into romanticism without either sympathy or mitigation. The children, it presently became apparent, were not [...] "true" [...] children. [...] "Forced upon her," [...] said Mr. Brumley. [...] "It makes one ill to think of it!" [...] It certainly very nearly made him ill. And as if these exercises in distinction had inflamed his conscience Mr. Brumley wrote two articles in the Hebdomadal denouncing impure literature, decadence, immorality, various recent scandalous instances, and the suffragettes, declaring that woman's place was the home and that [...] "in a pure and exalted monogamy lies the sole unitary basis for a civilized state." [...] The most remarkable thing about this article is an omission. That Sir Isaac's monogamy with any other instances that might be akin to it was not pure and exalted, and that it needed--shall we call it readjustment? is a view that in this article Mr. Brumley conspicuously doesn't display. It's as if for a moment, pen in hand, he had eddied back to his old absolute positions....|$|E
60|$|But {{some will}} say that parochial civilization is only a {{peculiar}} form of civilization, because its centre is a church. Peculiar? That is the last word which any one would apply to such a civilization, if he knows history. Will any one mention any civilization, past or present, whose centre has not been (as long {{as it has been}} living and progressive) a church? All past civilizations--whether heathen or Mussulman, Jew or Christian--have {{each and every one of}} them, as a fact, held that the common and local worship of a God was a sign to them of their common and local unity; a sign to them of their religion, that is, the duties which bound them to each other, whether they liked or not. To all races and nations, as yet, their sacred grove, church, temple, or other place of worship, has been a sign to them that their unity and duties were not invented by themselves, but were the will and command of an unseen Being, who would reward or punish them according as they did those duties or left them undone. So it has been in the civilizations of the past. So it will be in the civilization of the future. If the Christian religion were swept away--as it never will be, for it is eternal--and a civilization founded on what is called Nature put in its place, then we should see a worship <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>called</b> Nature, and a temple thereof, set up as the symbol of that Natural civilization. So the Jacobins of France-- when they tried to civilize France on the mere ground of what they called Reason--had, whether they liked it or not, to instal a worship of Reason, and a goddess of Reason, for as long as they could contrive to last.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was within}} a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations, and, more {{important}} still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle edited. He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he discovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized. Stalky christened it the [...] "Swillingford Patriot," [...] in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took an interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave Beetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and scores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs--Peacock was that writer's name; there was Borrow's [...] "Lavengro"; an odd theme, purporting to be a translation <b>of</b> <b>something,</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "Ruba'iyat," [...] which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E. L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe's [...] "Faust [...] "; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for three days--Ossian; [...] "The Earthly Paradise"; [...] "Atalanta in Calydon"; and Rossetti--to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in under pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a verse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow breathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great men living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth; of years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young men know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and declaiming against the long-ridged seas.|$|E
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} current concert trends, in late 2009, the band {{expressed}} interest in performing Gretchen Goes to Nebraska in its entirety on tour. Pinnick elaborated, [...] "We {{like the idea of}} doing the whole of that record with a great light show, as part <b>of</b> <b>something</b> we’d <b>call</b> An Evening With King’s X. It wouldn’t be a full-blown tour, playing every hell-hole for three months. But we’d select specific, quality venues, make it special for the fans." ...|$|R

[...] These high-sounding naval names delighted Blunt, and he had no doubt there must be virtue in them.|$|R
