5|$|In 2003, Kon's third work, Tokyo Godfathers, was announced. The film {{centers on}} a trio <b>of</b> <b>homeless</b> persons in Tokyo who {{discover}} a baby on Christmas Eve {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost more to make than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes of homelessness and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|Recorded at Island Records' {{studio in}} London, {{it was their}} first album with John Evan as a {{full-time}} member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond, and last album featuring Clive Bunker on drums. Something of {{a departure from the}} band's previous work, the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs <b>of</b> <b>homeless</b> people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness {{appears to}} be largely {{concentrated}} within urban areas. Central cities hold 71% <b>of</b> the <b>homeless</b> population while the suburbs have 21% <b>of</b> the <b>homeless</b> population. Only 9% <b>of</b> the <b>homeless</b> class can be located within rural areas.|$|R

Although it was down to 25% in 2008, it still {{accounted for}} the largest portion <b>of</b> Vancouver's <b>homeless.</b> Welfare support, which is used by almost half <b>of</b> Vancouver's <b>homeless</b> population, still cannot provide enough for rental {{in many areas of}} the city. Despite this, income assistance from the government provides for much of the income <b>of</b> Vancouver's <b>homeless,</b> as well as supplementary income from work on the side such as searching garbage cans and dumpsters, and panhandling.|$|R
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health <b>of</b> <b>homeless</b> children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group <b>of</b> <b>homeless</b> people, one of whom she helps give birth, and a family of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population <b>of</b> <b>homeless</b> rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
