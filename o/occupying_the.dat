5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one <b>occupying</b> <b>the</b> western Atlantic {{and the other}} <b>occupying</b> <b>the</b> eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.

Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
