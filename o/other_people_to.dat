They persuade <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never to throw a party again.|$|E
5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield any players, coaches, equipment, or a home field. March helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary and handling the personnel decisions, and Gibson served as the team's president. Mara's friends were wary of investing in the team, but he convinced Matty Frank, a real estate investor, and a few <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> invest. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring stars such as running back Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early parts of the season, until he got into shape. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E

We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, {{he founded}} the Reform Party and won their presidential {{nomination}} for the 1996 election. His vice presidential running mate was Pat Choate. Because of the ballot access laws, he had to run as an Independent on many state ballots. Perot received 8% {{of the popular vote}} in 1996, much less than in the 1992 race, but still an unusually successful third-party showing by U.S. standards. He spent much less of his own money in this race than he had four years before, and also allowed <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> contribute to his campaign, unlike his prior race. One common explanation for the decline was Perot's exclusion from the presidential debates, based on the preferences of the Democratic and Republican party candidates. Jamin B. Raskin of Open Debates filed a lawsuit on Perot's behalf on this assumption.|$|E
25|$|After God and the archangels {{successfully}} battled the Darkness to submission at {{the beginning}} of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have the lust for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> <b>to</b> become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade {{to the bottom of the}} Marianas Trench, only to take it back and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to someone else would release the Darkness from her cage.|$|E
