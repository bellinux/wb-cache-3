5|$|It then <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that these}} causes or their {{equivalents}} are continually {{acting in the}} case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

[...] There were no objections, and the tale was finished in July.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 October 2009, he {{recorded}} {{the first episode}} of As It <b>Occurs</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> a weekly radio-style stand-up and sketch show made for the Internet. It stars himself, Emma Kennedy, Dan Tetsell and Christian Reilly and currently stands at 18 episodes and 5 bonus mini-episodes.

It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff.

500|$|... "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] is the series' last episode {{to feature}} Mimi Rogers as Agent Fowley. After reading {{a copy of}} the script, Rogers {{realized}} that her character was going to die before she reached the ending. The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as [...] "by far the most [...] had to do in an episode." [...] She later explained, [...] "It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> , uh oh, this is way too good. I have too much to do. They're going to kill me." ...|$|E
500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before how that would have an effect on his character [...] to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E

500|$|For {{the fact}} is as I soon came to realise myself, and then heard from others later, that the Colchians are {{obviously}} Egyptian. When the notion <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] I asked both the Colchians and the Egyptians about it, {{and found that the}} Colchians had better recall of the Egyptians than the Egyptians did of them. Some Egyptians said that they thought the Colchians originated with Sesostris’ army, but I myself guessed their Egyptian origin not only because the Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common in others too) but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only peoples in the world who practise circumcision and who have always done so.|$|E
500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked it all down you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that a group of}} ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2014 {{cover story}} for Out {{promoting}} The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch opened up about sexual experimentation {{during his time}} in boarding schools stating, [...] "While there was experimentation, it had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as, 'Oh, this is that!' It was just boys and their penises, {{the same way with}} girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E

500|$|Hepburn {{went on to}} {{make the}} sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second film written {{specifically}} as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: [...] "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that her audience was missing a treat." [...] Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not {{end up in the}} film. Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as I {{was in the room}} as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, {{like most of the}} movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{in a million years}} that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ... So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age, having played myself previously when 100-and-I-don't-know-what." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolf {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of mandated paid sick days for employees, with his company Cape Air offering paid leave for all employees. Wolf, along with Kay Khan in the House of Representatives, introduced the [...] "2013 Earned Paid Sick Time" [...] bill, which would allow employees to one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty worked. To generate support among other Senators, Wolf {{went so far as}} to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a Dunkin' Donuts frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted “it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,” and referred to the experience as “an eye-opener.” Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.|$|E
