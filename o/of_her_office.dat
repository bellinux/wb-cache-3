25|$|Clarkson {{arrived in}} Canada {{with her family}} in 1941, as a refugee from Japanese-occupied Hong Kong, and was raised in Ottawa. After {{receiving}} a number of university degrees, Clarkson worked as a producer and broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and a journalist for various magazines. Her first diplomatic posting came in the early 1980s, when she promoted Ontarian culture in France and other European countries. She was in 1999 appointed as governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, {{on the recommendation of}} Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien, to replace Roméo LeBlanc as viceroy and she occupied the post until succeeded by Michaëlle Jean in 2005. While Clarkson's appointment as the Canadian vicereine was generally welcomed at first, she caused some controversy during her time serving as the Queen's representative, mostly due to costs incurred in the operation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office,</b> as well as a somewhat anti-monarchist attitude toward the position.|$|E

Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office.</b> According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E

500|$|The Duke, [...] "much {{thinner and}} greatly altered", {{returned}} to England in November. His relationship with Anne had suffered further setbacks {{in recent months}} (she had refused to grant him his requested appointment of Captain-General for life, and had interfered in military appointments). The damage done to Marlborough's general standing was substantial {{because it was so}} visible. For now, though, the central issue was the Duchess whose growing resentment of Harley and Abigail had finally persuaded the Queen to be rid of her. Marlborough visited Anne on 17 January 1711 (O.S.) in a last attempt to save his wife, but she was not to be swayed, and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key (the symbol <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office)</b> within two days, warning, [...] "I will talk of no other business till I have the key".|$|E
500|$|Una Ellis-Fermor, who {{had been}} one of Rainbow's lecturers at Bedford, found her a {{position}} as a clerk at the Ministry of Pensions in Cambridge, where she also lectured part-time for adult education classes. At this point she received a telegram from the Ministry of Labour and National Service, who were tracking down graduates not working for the war effort, and was instructed to report for duty at the War Office. She served as part of Army Council secretariat, working for Lieutenant Colonel Alan Mocatta. There she took on increasing responsibilities, many related to supply and logistics for the war effort. As D-Day drew near, her workload became intense, and she took Benzedrine. During this time, she lived in London with her aunt Phyl on Kensington High Street. After her father joined the Army, her mother and siblings left the family farm and moved to the same street, about [...] away. Like many Londoners, they experienced the hazards of the German air raids on London. She served as a neighbourhood fire warden. The windows <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office</b> at the War Office were blown in twice, and were then replaced with scrim.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office</b> that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

[...] On several occasions, Crawford continued, Hughes had pressed his crotch against the window <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office.</b> On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes what she could do for him, he grabbed her head and pulled it towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.|$|E

2500|$|Clinton {{has also}} greatly {{expanded}} the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both {{to get its}} message out and to help empower people vis à via their rulers. Clinton said, [...] "We are {{in the age of}} participation, and the challenge ... is {{to figure out how to}} be responsive, to help catalyze, unleash, channel the kind of participatory eagerness that is there." [...] She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office</b> and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter Chelsea Clinton to refer to the secretary as [...] "TechnoMom".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} May 2014, Válková became {{involved}} in a dispute with her deputy minister Hana Marvanová, caused by disagreements over reductions in lawyers' fees and the appointment of some judicial officials. Marvanová subsequently resigned. Two weeks later she entered another dispute with another deputy, Pavel Štern, over the tendering process for electronic tags for domestic prisoners. Štern refused to provide her with detailed information about the tendering process, to which he claimed she was not entitled. He subsequently consulted the anti-corruption police. Válková cancelled the tender due to doubts about transparency and removed Štern from his post. The personnel changes at the Ministry of Justice provoked a wave of anger in political circles and Prime Minister Sobotka announced, that [...] "Should (Válková) show any further hesitation in the management <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office,</b> it will be ČSSD as a coalition party requiring {{a change in the}} whole Ministry of Justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{her years}} at court, Burney {{continued}} to produce her journals. To {{her friends and}} to Susanna, she recounted her life in court as well as significant political events, including the public trial of Warren Hastings for [...] "official misconduct in India". She also recorded the speeches of Edmund Burke at the trial. She was courted by {{an official of the}} royal household, Colonel Stephen Digby, but he eventually married another woman of greater wealth. The disappointment, combined with the other frustrations <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office,</b> contributed to her failing health at this time. In 1790 she prevailed on her father (whose own career had taken a new turn when he was appointed organist at Chelsea Hospital in 1783) to request that she be released from the post, which she was. She returned to her father's house in Chelsea, but continued to receive a yearly pension of £100. She maintained a friendship with the royal family and received letters from the princesses from 1818 until 1840.|$|E
5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>offices</b> – purely for the sake <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711.

That Mr Gilroy had then brought his car from home and put Ms Pilley's body in the boot and the next day transported her to a [...] "lonely grave" [...] somewhere in Argyll. He pointed to a [...] "sudden interruption" [...] in Ms Pilley's life since she had vanished. In particular, he highlighted that she had made no contact with anyone, there had been no activity on her credit cards and she had not made any arrangements for her pet fish and cat. It was also said that the lack of calls and texts from Mr Gilroy after Ms Pilley went missing suggested he knew she was already dead and that he had her phone. The advocate depute also reminded the jury that Mr Gilroy had gone on a journey of [...] "no importance" [...] the day after she had disappeared instead of [...] "assisting the police inquiry".|$|E

2500|$|The zōstē {{was raised}} to the rank in an {{elaborate}} investiture ceremony in the Theotokos of the Pharos palace chapel, which is recorded in the De Ceremoniis (I.50) of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959). The ceremony ended in the Chrysotriklinos audience hall, where she received from the emperor's hands the ivory tablets that were the particular insignium <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>office.</b> She then visited the Hagia Sophia, where the tablets were blessed by the Patriarch, before making {{her way to the}} Magnaura, where she received the congratulations of the women of the court and the spouses of the high dignitaries. Finally, she returned to the Pharos chapel, where she deposited an offering of 70 nomismata, before retiring to her apartments. Her distinctive dress, however, which probably gave the zōstē her name, was the broad belt or loros that she put on at the investiture ceremony. A descendant of the ancient Roman consular trabea, the golden lōros was the [...] "most prestigious imperial insignium", and was also worn by the Byzantine emperor and a select few of his highest dignitaries such as the Eparch of Constantinople or the magistroi. A less likely origin of the zōstē may derive from her position as chief lady-in-waiting to the empress, among whose duties was to supervise her dress, or, as the Patria of Constantinople puts it to [...] "gird" [...] the empress.|$|E
