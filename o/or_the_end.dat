5|$|The {{idea for}} The Beginning <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>End</b> {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was already working on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the middle}} <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 1700s, {{much of the}} Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} was on the frontier. During this time, there were many forts, such as Fort Titzell in the watershed. In 1769, the northern side of Buffalo Creek was surveyed. In the same year, {{the area in the}} vicinity of the creek was opened to settlers. John Sierer was among the first to arrive, settling on the creek in 1769. The prominent Revolutionary War veteran Colonel John Kelly built an estate on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek. In 1780, there was an Indian attack near the mouth of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E
