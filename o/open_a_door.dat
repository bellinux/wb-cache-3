Carter and British consul James Hay Wodehouse had already visited England in 1879 to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> for the process.

There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could not be changed without the approval of the governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.|$|E

25|$|In Batman vol. 3, #16, Bane has {{recruited}} his old henchmen Bird, Trogg, and Zombie in {{his quest}} to break Batman {{once and for all}} before recapturing Psycho Pirate from Arkham Asylum. Bane hangs Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Damian Wayne in the Batcave before setting off for the asylum, but the three survive. Bane's henchmen then capture Catwoman, Duke Thomas, Commissioner Gordon, and Bronze Tiger to cut Batman off from his allies. Bane beats Batman savagely in an alley and believes him dead, but finds out that Catwoman has escaped, freed the rest of the hostages, and tied up Bane's henchmen, giving Batman a chance to flee. Enraged, Bane storms to Arkham Asylum, where Alfred is forcing Psycho Pirate to undo the fear he inflicted upon Gotham Girl. Batman decides to release many of the inmates to fight Bane and thus give himself time to heal, but Bane easily beats the likes of Two-Face, Solomon Grundy, Amygdala, Scarecrow, Firefly, and the Mad Hatter, among others, before making the Riddler <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> to Batman for him. Bane and Batman then have another fight, with a bloodied Batman barely beating his nemesis.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{resulted in}} a robbery tour of the Swedish province of Östergötland in 1999, which ended on 28 May in Kisa where Arklöv, Axelsson and Olsson robbed Östgöta Enskilda Bank. Olsson waited outside the bank armed with an Uzi submachine gun while Arklöv and Axelsson went inside the bank, kicked <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> to the offices and cashregisters and threatened the employees to open the vaults. As the vault was time-locked, the robbers were forced to wait 12 minutes before leaving the bank with a large sum of cash. They got away with over two million SEK, but during their escape a lone policeman, Kennet Eklund, followed them in his car. The robbers spotted him and opened fire, two hand grenades were thrown in his direction and against his car. Both hand grenades exploded but Eklund got away without any injuries while the robbers continued their escape. About 10 minutes later two policemen, Olle Borén and Robert Karlström, spotted the robbers' vehicle and drove after them in their own police car. Gunfire occurred as both cars had stopped, and the two policemen were gunned down and executed with their own guns.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

2500|$|Breaking can {{be either}} actual, such as by forcing <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door,</b> or constructive, such as by fraud or threats.

2500|$|Among {{the simple}} solutions, the [...] "combined doors solution" [...] comes closest to a {{conditional}} solution, {{as we saw}} in the discussion of approaches using the concept of odds and Bayes theorem. It is based on the deeply rooted intuition that revealing information that is already known does not affect probabilities. But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though we know in advance that the host will <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> and reveal a goat, we do not know which door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> revealing a goat and (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is not because of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, if he has a choice (...) [...] The assertion therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given, the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the reasoning used to justify it is defective.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{earliest}} stages of level design, {{it was decided}} each level would begin with a free-fall minigame, before the level proper begins. Initially, the plan was for Kurt to travel through each level on a futuristic motorcycle, which would morph around him to protect him and would be integrated into his Coil Suit. However, this idea was ultimately scrapped {{in favor of a}} more straightforward 3D [...] "run-and-game" [...] style gameplay. Another early concept which was scrapped was that sniper mode would only be available to the player during the boss fight {{at the end of each}} level. This was changed so the player could use sniper mode whenever they wished. An early concept which did make it into the final game was the notion of ridiculous weaponry. One of the first such weapons conceived was the [...] "World's Smallest Nuclear Bomb," [...] as the team wanted to come up with the most over-the-top way imaginable to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Saving {{the game}} was made easier by {{allowing}} one to save a game in a House of Healing, rather than talking to a king. Also, the save ("Confession" [...] in the DS remake) and EXP point to the next level-up ("Divination" [...] in the DS remake) are now separate commands. Returning to {{the format of the}} original North American Dragon Warrior, programmers allowed users to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> using a command appearing in the top level of the menu (rather than requiring users to search through various characters' inventories for the key as in some previous games). The only requirement was that at least one character in the party needed to have an appropriate key in his or her inventory. Since this command was added, an unlocked door was added in this game, as well as large Castle Doors. However, this command was eliminated in later games and the remake, in which doors can be opened by attempting to walk through them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{directed}} by Bronwen Hughes from a script by Jeff Eastin. Hughes had previously directed an episode of Burn Notice, and would later go on to direct the pilot of Fairly Legal, another USA Network original series. For the pilot, the cast was joined by special guest star Diahann Carroll, who portrayed June, an elderly woman who allows Neal to stay in her home. Additional guest stars included Sharif Atkins as Clinton Jones, an agent working under Peter Burke. Denise Vasi guest starred as June's granddaughter Cindy, while Alexandra Daddario made a small appearance as Neal's disappearing girlfriend, Kate Moreau. Carroll, Atkins, Vasi, and Daddario would all become recurring guests. The final additions to the cast were Mark Sheppard as Curtis Hagen, Michael Gaston as Thompson, and Stephen Singer as Vincent. The episode was filmed on location in New York City. [...] "One {{of the best things}} about New York is [...] {{all we have to do}} is <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> or point a camera at a window, and we've got absolutely brilliant production value," [...] Eastin stated.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{we assume}} that the host {{believes}} that the success of the game is based on the tense moment in which the host has <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> with <b>a</b> goat after the first choice of the player and gives the player the possibility of changing his choice. So the host plays with a strategy which fixes the probability α of the player of winning the car and maximizes the proportion of shows in which the host <b>opens</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> with <b>a</b> goat.|$|R
2500|$|The {{version of}} the Monty Hall problem {{published}} in Parade in 1990 did not specifically state that the host would always open another door, or always offer a choice to switch, or even never open the door revealing the car. However, vos Savant made it clear in her second follow-up column that the intended host's behavior could only be {{what led to the}} [...] probability she gave as her original answer. [...] "Anything else is a different question". [...] "Virtually all of my critics understood the intended scenario. I personally read nearly three thousand letters (out of the many additional thousands that arrived) and found nearly every one insisting simply that because two options remained (or an equivalent error), the chances were even. Very few raised questions about ambiguity, and the letters actually published in the column were not among those few." [...] The answer follows if the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly (Mueser and Granberg, 1999). The table below shows a variety of other possible host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.|$|E
2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together – Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it for no good reason. Their aim was to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door.</b> [...] It is beyond me how the name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they have always done. They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Parade {{column and}} its {{response}} received considerable {{attention in the}} press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which Monty Hall himself was interviewed. [...] Hall understood the problem, giving the reporter a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on Let's Make a Deal differed from {{the rules of the}} puzzle. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show's actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts' insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. [...] "That's the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door," [...] he said. [...] "They'd think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. We called it the Henry James treatment. It was 'The Turn of the Screw.'“ Hall clarified that as a game show host {{he did not have to}} follow the rules of the puzzle in the vos Savant column and did not always have to allow a person the opportunity to switch (e.g., he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door). [...] "If the host is required to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> all the time and offer you a switch, then you should take the switch," [...] he said. [...] "But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware. Caveat emptor. It all depends on his mood.” ...|$|E
