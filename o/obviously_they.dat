25|$|Classes of {{schedules}} {{defined by}} relaxed global serializability properties either contain the global serializability class, or are incomparable with it. What differentiates techniques for relaxed global conflict serializability (RGCSR) properties {{from those of}} relaxed conflict serializability (RCSR) properties that are not RGCSR is typically the different way global cycles (span two or more databases) in the global conflict graph are handled. No distinction between global and local cycles exists for RCSR properties that are not RGCSR. RCSR contains RGCSR. Typically RGCSR techniques eliminate local cycles, i.e., provide local serializability (which can be achieved effectively by regular, known concurrency control methods), however, <b>obviously</b> <b>they</b> do not eliminate all global cycles (which would achieve global serializability).|$|E
25|$|Baldwin’s forces {{inside the}} castle began to {{reinforce}} the main gates around the castle. Shortly after, the Muslims relit {{the fire in the}} tunnel under the castle, and the walls collapsed. As a result, the Crusaders’ attempts to refortify the castle were in vain and, approximately six days after the siege began, Saladin and his troops entered Chastellet. By 30 August 1179, the Muslim invaders had pillaged the castle at Jacob’s Ford and killed most of its residents. On the same day, less than one week after reinforcements were called, Baldwin and his supporting army set out from Tiberias, only to discover smoke permeating the horizon directly above Chastellet. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>they</b> were too late to save the 700 knights, architects, and construction workers who were killed and the other 800 who were taken captive. Baldwin and his reinforcements turned back towards Tiberias and Saladin ordered the remains of the fortification to be torn down.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Kathryn Griffith, [...] "The {{importance}} of Learned Hand's philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in {{his view of the}} pragmatic origin of all law, but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights." [...] Hand proposed that the Bill of Rights was not law at all but a set of [...] "admonitory" [...] principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers. He therefore opposed the use of its [...] "due process of law" [...] clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation. He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution. In Hand's analysis, [...] "due process" [...] {{is no more than a}} stock phrase to cover a long tradition of common law procedure. He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights. The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect. For Hand, a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process. A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting undemocratically. Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti-liberal laws that he detested. His reasoning has never been widely accepted. Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit, Jerome Frank, who wrote: [...] "t seems to me that here, most uncharacteristically, Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping, one which rests on a too-sharp either-or, all or nothing, dichotomy. ...Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job. But just as <b>obviously,</b> <b>they</b> can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{away on a}} trip to England in March 2004, Christopher {{received}} an email from Joan Porco's account admonishing him for failing classes at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, NY. In the message, Joan and Peter complained to their son, [...] "You just left and (we) can't believe (our) eyes as I look at your interim grade report. You know what they say, 'Three strikes and you're out.' Explain yourself." [...] The email's subject header was [...] "Failing Grades-You did it again!" [...] Several days later, Christopher replied in a message to his father. Blaming the community college's office of registrar, he wrote, [...] "ut <b>obviously</b> <b>they</b> are incorrect...My lowest grade that I got on anything was a B on a physics test...Don't jump to conclusions, I'm fine." [...] Porco earned readmission to the University of Rochester with a forged transcript from HVCC.

What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.'

2500|$|The young missionaries {{arrived in}} Shanghai on June 28, 1856, and {{attended}} Morning Prayer in Chinese {{the next day}} (a Sunday) at the Church of Our Saviour, which Boone had established (together with a boarding school). Then they visited the city's other Episcopal Church, Christ Church in the city's Chinese section. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>they</b> needed to learn the local dialect, as well as Mandarin (the main dialect) and the literary language Wen-li--although dictionaries were poor, textbooks unavailable, and most Chinese teachers focused on Confucian classics and memorizing thousands of characters. Bishop Boothe, VTS graduate Cleveland Keith (who had arrived in 1851) and local teachers helped the young missionaries, who studied nine hours daily. Soon, Liggins substituted for the British chaplain, John Hobson, who ministered to foreign sailors and the British settlement at Trinity Church. More seasoned VTS graduates (class of 1845) Rev. Robert Nelson and Rev. Edward Syle allowed the young missionaries to accompany them as they were able. Before Rt. Rev. Boone returned to the United States for health and furlough, he ordained both to the priesthood (on January 11, 1857).|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. <b>Obviously</b> <b>they</b> didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV."
