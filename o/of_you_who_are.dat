2500|$|The next morning, Dwyer went to {{his press}} conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21 page {{prepared}} text later described as a [...] "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer spoke out {{against the death penalty}} and expressed regret for voting in favor of it {{while he was in the}} Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, [...] "Those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Gies, {{writing for}} Polygon, wrote that 343 Industries {{had much to}} prove with Halo 5 after Halo 4s online {{population}} [...] "evaporated", The Master Chief Collections woes, and Microsoft's need for a strong title to sell more Xbox Ones. [...] "343's response to that quagmire," [...] Gies wrote, [...] " [...] {{to return to the}} fundamentals of what made the series great in the first place. The studio has brought Halos mechanics kicking and screaming into the modern era, while providing the most bombastic, co-op-driven campaign in Halo history." [...] GameSpots Mike Mahardy agreed that 343 had produced some of the best iterations of the game series' facets with Halo 5. IGN's Brian Albert opined that 343 Industries had created an even bigger game than previous entries, with [...] "the strongest combat Halo has ever seen". Destructoids Chris Carter felt that Halo 5 failed to grab him {{in the same way as}} previous games had, [...] "but those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still content with Master Chief and his wacky adventures across the galaxy will likely walk away satisfied." [...] More critically, the reviewers of GamesTM felt that Halo 5 was [...] "sheepish and safe" [...] and represented a series low.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E
