5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad {{travelled}} to the Jama Masjid Delhi (main mosque) of Delhi {{accompanied by}} twelve of his followers, where some 5,000people were gathered. Before the debate started, {{there was a}} discussion on the conditions, {{which led to the}} conclusion that the debate should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.|$|E

As Ray tracks Billy to the ranch, he meets a group of Texas Rangers who tell him they are about to attack the ranch because Mr. Ferguson is a rustler. Ray helps them, chasing Billy into the fields, and {{shooting}} him. Billy falls from a mountain into a nearby river. However, at that moment, Ray hears screaming coming from the ranch. He returns to find the Rangers were in fact bandits, who have killed most of the occupants of the house and taken Molly captive. Ray races after them, but they reach the river before he can catch them. In despair, he breaks down, questioning if he has been right about anything, asking if God has abandoned him, and determining to try to redeem himself by saving Molly.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian, the Sugababes revealed that Austin wrote the song after reading [...] "the cuttings file he was sent about the band". Keisha Buchanan, one of the group's members, elaborated upon this: [...] "All the rubbish and nasty stuff that's been written about us, calling us the Sugalumps, that sort of thing." [...] The title of the song's parent album, Taller in More Ways, {{was inspired by a}} line in [...] "Ugly", which reads: [...] "I grew taller than them in more ways / But there'll always be <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> say / Something bad to make them feel great".|$|E

500|$|In 1924 J.

[...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|Woolf {{suggests}} that Constantine {{and his cousin}} Donald may have passed Giric's reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive High Kings of Ireland, Áed Findliath and Flann Sinna. Giric died in 889. If {{he had been in}} exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin DonaldII became king. Donald's reputation is suggested by the epithet dasachtach, a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the 11th-century writings of Flann Mainistrech, echoed by the his description in the Prophecy of Berchan as [...] "the rough <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> think relics and psalms of little worth". Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at Dunnottar in the Mearns in 900. Constantine succeeded him as king.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{he agrees}} with Bernhard in that the poem seems to create two themes, one which argues for devotion from a younger lover to <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> not be around much longer, and another which urges the young lover to enjoy his {{fleeting}} youth, James Schiffer asserts that the final couplet, instead of being unneeded and unimportant, brings the two interpretations together.

2500|$|Both stories {{also have}} a prophesied [...] "Chosen One" [...] who will destroy evil.

He does this after being redeemed by his son, Luke Skywalker. More recent theories contrast this and argue that Luke is indeed the chosen <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> bring balance to The Force.|$|E
2500|$|George McCready Price was {{important}} in developing flood geology, and while he had limited influence {{at a time when}} all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a Seventh-day Adventist, and followed {{one of the founders of}} the church, Ellen White, in seeing fossils as evidence of the Great Flood. In 1906, Price published Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory in which he offered $1000 [...] "to any <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will,</b> in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another." ...|$|E

50|$|Arminians {{hold that}} God does not predetermine, but instead infallibly knows <b>who</b> <b>will</b> believe and perseveringly be saved.

Although God knows {{from the beginning of}} the world <b>who</b> <b>will</b> go where, the choice is still with the individual. The Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus strongly opposed the views of Jacobus Arminius with his doctrine of supralapsarian predestination.|$|R

Sandow himself figures little in Dismal Light, the main character being his son, who is delaying his escape from an unstable star system in order to force his distant father to come in and ask him personally. While Isle of the Dead has Sandow living a life of irresponsible luxury as an escape from his personal demons, [...] "Dismal Light" [...] anchors his character as <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> face up to his responsibilities, however reluctantly.|$|E
