5|$|Several rebellions erupted {{during the}} regency. The first were the Rebellion of Santa Rita (1831), the Revolt of the Year of the Smoke (1833) and the Cabanada (or War of the Cabanos, 1832–34), which sought {{the return of}} Pedro I and which {{had the support of}} common people, former slaves, and slaves. The death of Pedro I on 24 September 1834 ended their hopes. The {{promulgation}} of the Additional Act in 1834, a constitutional amendment that gave higher administrative and political provincial decentralization, exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a way of giving the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. But even in this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.|$|E

25|$|A fourth legal {{argument}} is that comprehensive campaigns violate federal anti-trust law. As unions work with other organizations, it is claimed that they form, essentially, a commercial enterprise which seeks to economically dominate the market much {{in the same way}} that a monopoly does. In support of this claim, critics note that the Supreme Court has read the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts in such a way that unions are held exempt from federal antitrust laws but <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as a union acts in its own self-interest and does not lose its primary character as a labor union by combining with other, non-labor groups or organizations.

In the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area book, storyteller Old Coyote {{describes}} a legend related to the bighorn sheep. A man possessed by evil spirits attempts to kill his heir by pushing the young man over a cliff, but the victim is saved by getting caught in trees. Rescued by bighorn sheep, the man takes the name of their leader, Big Metal. The other sheep grant him power, wisdom, sharp eyes, sure-footedness, keen ears, great strength, and a strong heart. Big Metal returns to his people with the message that the Apsaalooka people will survive <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as the river winding out of the mountains is known as the Bighorn River.|$|E
25|$|In the X-Men film series, Magneto {{is portrayed}} by Ian McKellen (original iteration) and by Michael Fassbender (younger self). His {{character}} {{development in the}} films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader Malcolm X. The character's pre-teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in X-Men) and by Bill Milner (in X-Men: First Class). His real name is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, {{which at the time}} was his name in the comics, and was a holocaust survivor. Though he was good friends with Charles Xavier, his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as he remains in control of it. In the X-Men films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his helmet which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism to an almost unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto appears in seven of the nine X-Men films up to 2016.|$|E

50|$|The Augusti were legally {{distinct}} from the old Princeps (Roman Emperors under the Principate), because under the Principate, the Princeps took {{the place of the}} old republican magistrates. When a Princeps issued a decree, that decree was <b>only</b> valid <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as that Princeps was Emperor, whereas in contrast, under the Republic, any decree issued by a magistrate was <b>only</b> good <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as that magistrate was in office. Under the Republic and the Principate, only the Senate and legislative assemblies were continuous institutions, and thus only they could pass laws that remained in effect indefinitely. Under Diocletian's new Dominate, the Augusti took the place of the Senate and the assemblies, and thus any decree of an Augustus remained in force even after that particular emperor left office. Such an act could only be invalidated by a future Emperor. The logical extension of this concept meant that neither a magistrate, the assemblies, nor the senate, could legally restrain the Emperor.|$|R
500|$|In March 2014, Dinklage {{confirmed}} that Season 4 would [...] "stick fairly closely" [...] to Tyrion's plot line in A Storm of Swords, adding that [...] "those reversals of fortune really send [...] down the rabbit hole." [...] He {{notes that the}} character changes in Season 4, and [...] "really ends up {{in a different place}} than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long.</b> He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life , and that causes a tremendous amount of damage – because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms." [...] Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, [...] "If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other." [...] As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.|$|E
500|$|Asturias employs figurative {{language}} to describe dream imagery and the irrational. Literary critic Hughes Davies {{points out that}} Asturias frequently appeals to the reader's auditory senses. Asturias's often incantatory style employs [...] "unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound". This helps readers to understand the physical {{as well as the}} psychological aspects of the novel. According to Knightly, [...] "few of Asturias's characters have much psychological depth; their inner conflicts tend to be externalized and played out at the archetypal level". More significantly, Asturias was the first Latin American novelist to combine stream of consciousness writing and {{figurative language}}. Hughes Davies argues that from the outset of , the gap between words and reality is exemplified through onomatopoeia, simile and repetition of phrases. Knightly notes that [...] "animistic elements surface occasionally in the characters' stream of consciousness". For example, in the chapter [...] "Tohil's Dance", Tohil, the God of Rain in Maya mythology, is imagined by Angel Face as arriving [...] "riding on a river of pigeons' breasts which flowed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil demands a human sacrifice and is content <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> as he [...] "can prevail over men who are hunters of men". Tohil pronounces: [...] "Henceforth there will be neither true death nor true life. Now dance." [...] As Knightly explains, this scene follows the President's orders for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that ends in his death, and is [...] "a sign of the President's evil nature and purposes". Davies contends that these literary techniques, when [...] "combined together with a discontinuous structure, give the text its surrealistic and nightmarish atmosphere".|$|E
