5|$|The {{harmonium}} was out <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> with everything. It wasn't even in {{tune with}} itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
40|$|We propose {{using the}} {{statistical}} {{measurement of the}} sample skewness {{of the distribution of}} mean firing rates <b>of</b> a <b>tuning</b> curve to quantify sharpness <b>of</b> <b>tuning.</b> For some features, like binocular disparity, tuning curves are best described by relatively complex and sometimes diverse functions, making it difficult to quantify sharpness with a single func-tion and parameter. Skewness provides a robust nonparametric measure <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> curve sharpness that is invariant with respect to the mean and variance <b>of</b> the <b>tuning</b> curve and is straightforward to apply to a wide range <b>of</b> <b>tuning,</b> including simple orientation tuning curves and complex object tuning curves that often cannot even be described parametrically. Because skewness does not depend on a specific model or function <b>of</b> <b>tuning,</b> it is especially appealing to cases of sharpening where recurrent interactions amongneuronsproduce sharper tuning curves that deviate in a complexmanner from the feedforward function <b>of</b> <b>tuning.</b> Since tuning curves for all neurons are not typically well described by a single para-metric function, this model independence additionally allows skewness to be applied to all recorded neurons, maximizing the statistical power of a set of data. We also compare skewness with other nonparametric mea-sures <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> curve sharpness and selectivity. Compared to these other nonparametric measures tested, skewness is best used for capturing th...|$|R

5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> to him.|$|E

25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E

Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E

25|$|There have {{traditionally}} been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on engine size, and one class for sidecars. Classes for 50 cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, and 500cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s {{and most of the}} 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In part this was due to rules, which allowed a multiplicity of cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and a multiplicity of gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states <b>of</b> <b>tune).</b> In the 1960s, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} white {{characters}} {{on a black}} background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon {{on the right side}} was added with the month and year in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly out <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> with the alphanumeric sequence, and {{the reason for this is}} that these are imported used vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the same}} year, the GTV6, {{a version of the}} GTV with the SOHC V6 2.5L engine from the Alfa Romeo Alfa 6 luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood {{received}} a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six downdraught Dell'Orto carburettors in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> much better. The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV6 Gran Turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including a new gear ratios and an updated interior in 1984.|$|E
40|$|A {{large sample}} <b>of</b> {{threshold}} <b>tuning</b> curves <b>of</b> single units from {{various levels of}} the auditory pathway was used {{in order to examine}} the relationship between best frequency and a measure <b>of</b> sharpness <b>of</b> <b>tuning.</b> This measure is simply the tuning curve bandwidth at 20 dB above threshold on a square-root scale of frequency. The transformation was found to be largely independent of unit best frequency, suggesting that it is suitable for comparing sharpness <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> between samples. No difference in sharpness <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> was found between samples of units from nuclei in the lemniscal auditory pathway, although units from the anterior auditory field showed broader tuning than those in the lemniscal pathway...|$|R

25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E
