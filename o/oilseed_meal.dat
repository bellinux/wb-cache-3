To convert oilseed meals into protein-based plastic films compression moulding was used with varying processing temperature, chemical additives and protein extraction conditions. Twin screw extrusion was utilized to make films from blends of crambe meal and wheat gluten with urea as a combination denaturant and plasticizer. Tensile properties were examined and related to protein solubility and protein molecular weight (MW) distribution to reveal the underlying effects of different processing conditions. Varying the plasticizer content (glycerol) in crambe and carinata meal based plastics resulted {{in a variety of}} tensile responses with protein MW distributions (HPLC) indicating that the tensile changes were due to plasticization effects.

The {{aim of this}} work is to investigate the use of enzymes in assisting in the extraction of protein from different <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals,</b> namely rapeseed, soybean, and microalgae meals. In addition, microalgae without prior oil removal was also tested. The extraction was performed varying temperature, pH, and type of enzyme. More protein was extracted at alkaline conditions, compared to acidic conditions. At alkaline pH, 80 % protein of soybean meal and 15 – 30 % protein of rapeseed and microalgae meals was extracted without enzyme addition. The addition of enzyme under this condition increased protein extraction yield to 90 % for soybean meal and 50 – 80 % for rapeseed and microalgae meals. Here, Protex 40 XL, Protex P, and Protex 5 L that work at alkaline pH assisted protein extraction particularly for rapeseed and microalgae meals. Microalgae without prior oil removal had the lowest protein extraction yield, illustrating that oil removal prior to protein extraction is beneficial for protein recovery. In general, protein extraction was influenced by pH, the type of biomass, {{and the addition of}} enzyme, but not by the type of enzyme that was used...|$|R
40|$|Japan’s oilseed {{sector is}} divided into two main {{components:}} 1) a large oilseed-crushing industry that produces vegetable oil and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal,</b> and 2) industries using oilseeds for food, without crushing them for oil. In general, the oilseed-crushing industry is protected by tariffs on vegetable oil at the border, but receives no domestic subsidies. Oilseed production for food, in contrast, generally has no border protection but receives domestic subsidies. Japan’s policies support soybean producer incomes by paying the difference between market prices and higher target prices that reflect costs of production in Japan. Farmers who plant soybeans on fields diverted from rice production receive additional subsidies. In recent years, soybean production has grown in response to the large incentives offered by these policies. Tariffs on soy and canola oil favor crushing of oilseeds in Japan, at the expense of vegetable oil consumers.

40|$|The {{global market}} for oilseeds, grains, {{vegetable}} oil and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> {{is a complex}} market which is growing at a very fast pace, and which {{is characterized by the}} large volume of production which is traded between countries.

As a result, small importing countries, like Morocco, are in a vulnerable position, and take the full brunt of price volatility. In the 90 s, Moroccan oilseed production was relatively high, unfortunately production dropped over the years, and Morocco must now buy vegetable oil and proteins on the global market. Reviving oilseed production in Morocco would considerably help the country and provide numerous benefits, such as food security, improving the country’s trade balance, and enhancing the agronomic management of land thanks to the introduction of break crops.

40|$|Concerns about Vermont‘s {{dairy farm}} viability, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, and reliance {{on fossil fuels}} have prompted growing interest {{in the production of}} biodiesel and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> from Vermont-grown oilseed crops. The idea is that Vermont farmers could grow and harvest oilseed crops; the seed or beans could be pressed into vegetable oil and oilseed meal; and the oil could be processed into biodiesel, thereby producing both liquid biofuel and protein meal for livestock from Vermont crops. Results from this study indicate that oil, meal, and biodiesel production from sunflowers grown in Vermont is technically feasible, and may be economically feasible at both the farm and commercial scales, depending on scale and market conditions. Farmers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers are intrigued by the potential to decrease Vermont‘s dependency on imported fuels and feed, reduce farms‘ production costs, realize local economic benefits from import substitution, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the promise of ―Vermont-made‖ biodiesel and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal,</b> however, it remains largely an unproven concept. Production of oilseed crops is relatively rare in Vermont, especially in quantities sufficient for biodiesel or livestock meal production. The equipment, capital, acreage, and expertise needed to successfully grow, harvest, and process these crops have not been identified, and the economic feasibility, optimal scale, and environmental and macroeconomic impacts of these new enterprises in Vermont is unknown. This study investigates the technical and economic feasibility of producing biodiesel and livestock feed from Vermont oilseeds at a farm scale and a commercial scale. Technical feasibility at the farm scale is assessed using data from two Vermont farms. Enterprise budgets are used to assess the economic feasibility and profitability of the crop, oil and meal, and biodiesel enterprises individually and as a whole under two sets of market conditions. Economic feasibility and environmental and economic impacts of a commercial-scale biodiesel facility in Vermont are assessed using a simulation model. None of the farm-scale enterprises were profitable as budgeted in this analysis, although the commercial-scale plant was more profitable as crude oil prices rose. The most promising enterprise at the farm scale appears to be oil and meal production. This study prompts additional questions regarding the extent to which Vermont crop production should shift to include oilseeds for biodiesel production, the net energy return to the farm, and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from on-farm production...|$|E

40|$|<b>Oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> is an {{important}} source of essential amino acids (EAA) for livestock production. It is the second most important ingredient in pig feed after grains. Optimal use of these ingredients requires precise knowledge of amino acid standardized ileal digestibility (SID), which may vary depending on several factors including botanical variety or processing treatments. A meta-analysis was performed in order to derive models for predicting the SID of soybean, cotton and rapeseed meal EAA, based on chemical composition data such as CP, total concentration of each EAA and fibre (crude fibre, ADF and NDF) content. A database of 47 references (224 experimental treatments) was built. A model incorporating processing method of the meals (e. g. cold pressed, expeller pressed, solvent extracted), experimental surgical procedure (T-cannula, re-entrant cannula, post valve T-cannula and ileo-rectal anastomosis) and pig growth stage (BW⩽ or ⩾ 25 kg) was tested. Results indicated that neither processing nor BW affected EAA SID. NDF was the best predictor of SID (R 2 = 0. 944, 0. 836, 0. 779, 0. 899 and 0. 814, respectively, for Lys, Met, Thr, Trp and Val).

The mean ileal digestibility coefficients of amino acids in wheat and maize {{were higher than}} those in sorghum, triticale and barley. However, variations observed in individual amino acid digestibilities among samples within cereal type were greater than those determined between cereals. Threonine and lysine were the least digestible indispensable amino acids in the five cereals evaluated. The most digestible indispensable amino acid was phenylalanine in wheat and, leucine in maize and sorghum. In {{the case of the}} wheat middlings and rice polishings, threonine was the least digestible indispensable amino acid and arginine was the best digested. In the <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals</b> assayed, amino acid digestibility was highest for soya-bean and sunflower meals, intermediate for canola meal and lowest for cottonseed meal. Ileal digestibility coefficients of amino acids in lupins were found to be slightly lower than those in soya-bean meal. The amino acid digestibilities of field peas, faba beans and chickpeas were considerably lower than those of lupins. Digestibility of arginine was the highest and that of threonine was the lowest of the indispensable amino acids in <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals</b> and grain legumes, except in cottonseed meal. Lysine was the least digestible amino acid in cottonseed meal. In the animal protein sources assayed, digestibility coefficients of amino acids in blood meal were high, intermediate in fish meal, and low in meat meal, meat and bone meal and feather meal. Variation in amino acid digestibility coefficients determined for blood meal samples was small. However, wide variations in amino acid digestibilities were observed for other animal protein sources, highlighting significant batch-to-batch differences. In particular, marked variations were determined for meat meal and meat and bone meal samples.

During this same period, rapeseed crushing has risen strongly, Europe being the major player in this expansion (development of biodiesel) followed to a lesser extent by Canada and China. World exports of rapeseeds are dominated by Canada, by far the largest exporter. Japan is a traditional importer, while China and the EU (27) are less regular buyers. Although less spectacular than palm oil growth, rapeseed oil growth is also remarkable. Its consumption occurs mainly in the crushing countries, the EU being the principal consumer.

A 4 -year study was undertaken with a view to improve calving rates and weaner output by supplementing cows grazing either native or improved pastures with a high protein <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> (cottonseed meal; CSM) on four sites. These sites were subdivided into a total of 36 paddocks to allow for two replications in a 3 breeds X 3 supplementation rates X 2 pastures factorial design. Selected cows (no. = 216) from Hereford (H), Brahman (B) and Brahman X Hereford (BH) breed types were set to graze either native pastures (0. 45 to 0. 62 OMD, 8 to 15 g N per kg; low quality) or improved pastures (0. 47 to 0. 67 OA ID, 10 to 22 g N per kg; medium quality). Cows were given either 0, 750 or 1500 g/day of CSM for 130 days from calving until 4 weeks into a 12 - to 13 -week mating period. The CSM was given as two meals per week. Live weight at mating of cows on the low quality pasture was increased (P < 0. 01) over those not supplemented by feeding either 750 g CSM per day (H and B cows) or 1500 g CSM per day tall cows). There was no significant effect of supplementation on the mating weights of B cows grazing the medium quality sites. Calving rate of B cows was not increased by their supplementation on either low (4 -year mean 58. 3 %) or medium quality pastures (66. 8 %) but did tend to be higher in H cows when supplemented at 1500 g CSM per day on the low (66. 7 v. 78. 0 (s. e. 6. 09) %; P < 0. 1) and medium quality pastures (70. 5 v. 93. 5 (s. e. 4. 72) %).

Weaning weights of calves from and B and BH cows were increased (P < 0. 05) by supplementation of their darns at 750 g/day and for calves weaned from H cows supplemented at 1500 g/day of CSM. Supplementation at 1500 g/day on low quality pastures increased weaner output per cow mated by 120 % for H, by 65 % for BH cows and by 50 % for B cows.

In this lysimetric study we compared {{the effect of the}} application of three seed meals: partially defattedmeals of sunflower and of Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun), and completed defatted meal ofsunflower on the yield and N utilization of three vegetable crops (lettuce, chard and spinach), comparedto an unfertilized control and one fertilized with ammonium nitrate. Furthermore, we also investigatedthe residual effect of fertility of <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> application on winter barley and fallow. Both sunflowermeals revealed a fertilization effect comparable to that of the mineral fertilizer, whilst B. carinata mealreduced the yields of chard and spinach, due to low N availability as shown by the lower N use efficiencyindex. We argue that this lower efficacy of B. carinata meal was due to the technique of the application ofthe meal, that might have produced a high concentration of glucosinolates in the soil layer explored byroots, concurrently determining a significant impact on soil biota and direct phytotoxicity phenomena. A relevant part of the N applied with fertilizers was not absorbed by the three vegetables and henceaccumulated in the soil. Despite the high values of unabsorbed soil N in the plots fertilized with oilseedmeals, nitrate leaching was lower than with ammonium nitrate. The impact on global warming potentialof fertilization with defatted oilseed meals was assessed and shown to be lower than or comparable tothe impact of the synthetic fertilizer. In particular, defatted sunflower meals caused a lower impact perhectare and total biomass, and a similar impact per fresh marketable product. Overall, our findings confirmed the high value of oilseed meals as a sustainable alternative to mineralfertilizers. However, their efficacy strongly depends on the technique of application to the soil...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{fish meal}} (FM) and fish oil (FO) {{have been used}} {{extensively}} in aquafeeds, mainly due to their excellent nutritional properties. However, various reasons dictate the use of sustainable alternatives and {{the reduction of the}} dependence on these commodities in fish feeds. Hence, the aim of the present thesis was to investigate the effects of the replacement of FM and FO with two vegetable oils (VO) and an <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal</b> on the growth performance, feed utilization, nutrient and fatty acids (FA) digestibility and tissue FA composition and metabolism in three commercially important European fish species. Specifically, in Experiment I crude palm oil (PO) was used to replace FO in diets for rainbow trout. In Experiments II and III FO was replaced with rapeseed oil (RO) in diets for Atlantic salmon at various dietary protein/lipid levels aiming also at further reductions of FM by using low protein (high lipid) diet formulations. In Experiments II and III the fish were reared at low and high water temperatures, respectively, in order to elucidate, also, the potential effects of temperature. Lastly, the effects of the replacement of FM with full fat soya meal (FFS) in Atlantic cod were investigated in Experiment IV. The results of the present thesis showed no negative effects on growth performance and feed utilization in rainbow trout when FO was replaced with PO. The dietary inclusion of RO improved the growth of Atlantic salmon, possibly, due to changes in the nutrient and FA digestibilities and FA catabolism while, the growth and feed utilization were unaffected by the dietary protein/lipid level. However, the growth of Atlantic cod was affected negatively by the replacement of FM with FFS. The proximate composition of the fish whole body was in most cases unaffected by dietary treatments. The changes in dietary formulations affected the dietary FA compositions and resulted in significant changes in the fish tissue FA compositions. It was clearly shown that the fish tissue total lipid FA composition reflects the FA composition of the diet, although specific FA were selectively utilized or retained in the tissues by the fish. These may have serious implications not only for fish metabolism and growth but also for the quality of the final product, especially in terms of possible reductions of n- 3 HUFA.

40|$|Oilseeds may be {{processed}} {{to yield a}} number of potentially valuable compounds and fractions including oil, protein and small molecules. However, energy costs associated with industrial processing of oilseeds can be significant. For example, processes that use water to dissolve and separate materials are burdened with {{the costs associated with}} concentrating value-added products from dilute solutions. The ethanol industry produces large amounts of an aqueous solution called thin stillage that has little value and is used in animal feed. Thin stillage contains some of the necessary salts used in protein extraction but has a low pH. Protein extraction and protein isolate production is commonly conducted at higher pH. Waste alkali from biodiesel production has a high pH and can be used to adjust the pH of thin stillage to improve its ability to extract protein from <b>oilseed</b> <b>meal.</b> By combining the properties of the waste products of both the ethanol and the biodiesel industries, a complementary process is possible that may have greater economic potential than current practices in industry. In this study, processes for protein extraction from mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.) meal using thin stillage from ethanol production and glycerol from biodiesel production were studied. The osmotic potential of thin stillage used in this research was lower than that of water, whereas both the density and the viscosity were higher. The pH was typically 3. 7 - 3. 8, and the total Kjeldahl nitrogen was approximately 0. 08 – 0. 10 %, w/w. Organic compounds identified in thin stillage were isopropanol, ethanol, lactic acid, 1, 3 -propanediol, acetic acid, succinic acid, glycerophosphorylcholine, betaine, glycerol and phenethyl alcohol. In addition, yeasts, bacteria and fungi were also found. Moreover, the salt types and their concentrations in thin stillage were predictable. The salt types present in thin stillage were CaCl 2, NaCl, K 2 SO 4, NaNO 3, Mg(OH) 2, Na 2 SO 4 and KOH. A model thin stillage synthesized {{for the purposes of this}} research had components and chemical and physical properties comparable to those of thin stillage from ethanol production. Protein was extracted from ground, defatted meal using thin stillage at different pHs and salt concentrations. The results showed that pH and salt content affected protein extraction efficiency. However, no differences were found in the efficiency of extraction, SDS-PAGE profile, digestibility, lysine availability or amino acid composition of protein extracted with thin stillage, model thin stillage or sodium chloride solution. Moreover, extracted protein did not display significant hydrolysis. The results from peptide sequencing showed that napin and cruciferin were the most prevalent proteins in the extracted fractions. When increasing the scale of the extraction, the efficiency of protein extraction and the percentage of protein in the extracted protein were decreased. Protein recovery achieved with the complementary protocol was higher than that reported for a published protocol. Allyl isothiocyanate was found in protein extracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} of fruits results in high amounts of waste {{materials such as}} peels, seeds, stones, and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals.</b> A disposal of these materials usually represents a problem that is further aggravated by legal restrictions. Thus new aspects concerning {{the use of these}} wastes as by-products for further exploitation on the production of food additives or supplements with high nutritional value have gained increasing interest because these are high-value products and their recovery may be economically attractive. It is well known that by-products represent an important source of sugars, minerals, organic acid, dietary fibre and phenolics which have a wide range of action which includes antitumoral, antiviral, antibacterial, cardioprotective and antimutagenic activities. This review discusses the potential of the most important by-products of apple, grape and citrus fruits processing as a source of valuable compounds.

40|$|Cruciferous {{plants are}} known to produce over a hundred {{different}} mustard oil glycosides, which are derived from methionine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan. In oil-producing crops like Brassica napus (canola), the presence of indole glucosinolates in seed protein meals has decreased meal palatability and has limited their value as animal feed. We have transformed canola plants with a gene that encodes tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) {{in an attempt to}} redirect tryptophan into tryptamine rather than into indole glucosinolates. Transgenic plants that expressed this decarboxylase activity accumulated tryptamine while correspondingly lower levels of tryptophan-derived indole glucosinolates were produced in all plant parts compared with nontransformed controls. Of particular significance, the indole glucosinolate content of mature seeds from transgenic plants was only 3 % of that found in nontransformed seeds. These results demonstrate how the creation of artificial metabolic sinks could divert metabolite flow and be used to remove these undesirable indole glucosinolates, thereby increasing the value of the <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals,</b> which are produced after extraction of oil from the seed...|$|R
40|$|From {{the last}} few years, the {{inclusion}} of microbial phytase in poultry diets has increased significantly, mainly in response to heightened concerns over phosphorus pollution {{of the environment and}} as cheaper means to make phosphorus available to birds from phytate. Phytate is the major form of phosphorus, abundantly found in cereal grains, beans and <b>oilseed</b> <b>meals</b> used in poultry diet but the monogastric animals like poultry birds are unable to utilize this source of phosphorus due to lack of endogenous phytase enzyme. To meet the phosphorus requirements of poultry birds, inorganic phosphates are added to the poultry rations, which lead to the problem of environmental pollution as a large amount of phosphorus is excreted in the manure. Microbial phytase is used as an alternative of this, which has beneficial effects on the growth performance, feed efficiency, protein/amino acid digestibility, energy utilization, mineral retention, and bone growth of broilers due to the direct hydrolytic effects on phytate...|$|R
