On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} {{featured}} the 147's dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate {{could also be}} controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much like that on offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose stereo system were available, the stereo system could now also be operated via buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. Also the Selespeed gearbox control system was updated, buttons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault and service monitor.|$|E

25|$|These {{operate in}} an {{identical}} manner as the floor mounted shift lever {{when it is}} placed across the gate in manual mode. The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep both hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E

50|$|Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver, <b>steering</b> {{force and}} {{transmission}} of road forces back to <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel and <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> ratio of turns of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel to turns {{of the road}} wheels affect control and awareness. Play—free rotation of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel before <b>the</b> wheels rotate—is a common problem, especially in older model and worn cars. Another is friction. Rack and pinion steering is generally considered the best type of mechanism for control effectiveness. The linkage also contributes play and friction. Caster—offset of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> axis from <b>the</b> contact patch—provides some of the self-centering tendency.|$|R

25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power assisted steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{research objective}} {{which could not}} be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column cut the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.|$|E

25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material.

25|$|The 2010 Shelby GT500 was {{revealed}} by Ford through {{a press release}} on January 1, 2009, prior to a public unveiling at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. Many of the basic design characteristics of the new GT500 are shared {{with that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT. The GT500 gains the same exterior and interior updates as the 2010 Mustang and Mustang GT. The front fascia is new with larger upper and lower grilles, a unique hood, large fog lights mounted in the lower front fascia (similar to the previous GT500), Shelby's signature cobra badges on the grille, front fenders, and trunk lid medallion (with Shelby lettering over the medallion), 19-inch wheels (18-inch on the convertible model), and a Gurney Flap rear spoiler. Inside the GT500 gains a cobra disc <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, shift ball, and seats with embroidered cobras.|$|E
25|$|The Model T's {{transmission}} {{was controlled}} with three foot pedals and a lever mounted {{to the road}} side of the driver's seat. The throttle was controlled with a lever <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. The left pedal was used to engage the transmission. With the floor lever in either the mid position or fully forward and the pedal pressed and held forward, the car entered low gear. When held in an intermediate position, the car was in neutral. If the left pedal was released, the Model T entered high gear, but only when the lever was fully forward – in any other position, the pedal would only move up {{as far as the}} central neutral position. This allowed the car to be held in neutral while the driver cranked the engine by hand. The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals.|$|E
