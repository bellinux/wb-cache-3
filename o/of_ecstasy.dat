5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{and three}} {{associates}} were extradited to the United States.

The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E
