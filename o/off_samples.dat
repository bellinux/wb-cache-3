Taraxacum officinale is a very ubiquitous species of degraded soil found in urban environment and. It can grow in very shallow spaces between {{the cracks in the}} pavements. This study represents a preliminary approach to verify the presence of metals in the soil-like material collected by urban runoff, the metal uptake by dandelion, and therefore check the possible alteration of some of its physiological parameters {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of its adaptation. The run off was collected in three sites in the town of Pisa and analyzed for Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn after nitric-perchloric microwave digestion by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The total values of Pb and Zn exceeded the limits for residential areas respectively in two and three sites. Trials were set up growing dandelion seedlings on the soil runoff material in floating cultivation. Poyphenols, antioxidants, sulphydryl groups and chlorophyll were measured in dandelion leaves grown on the contaminated material and on the control. The phenolic compound content was extracted with methanol, and was assayed quantitatively at A 765 with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, whereas 'antioxidant power' was determined using the FRAP method. Chlorophylls a (Chla) and b (Chlb) were extracted from young leaf discs (10 mm) with N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) and determined spectrophotometrically. The first two parameters (polyphenols and antioxidants) were higher in the run <b>off</b> <b>samples</b> compared to the control in one case, sulphydryl groups showed no difference, and chlorophyll was lower in the run <b>off</b> <b>samples.</b> These results indicate thatdandelion can survive in case of plant stress by simply altering its physiological parameters...|$|E

This data record {{was used to determine}} the thermal diffusivity of each produce sample by the empirical approach of the first author and his co-workers. Thermal diffusivity was found to be higher than the literature value. This is due to additional cooling effect resulting from desiccation of the exposed samples. The value decreased with the amount of cooling of the produce. The rate of reduction was fast in the beginning and later it had slowed down. The rate of decrease of thermal diffusivity was slow in case of produce samples with natural skin. In case of peeled <b>off</b> <b>samples,</b> this rate in the decrease was more pronounced. This must be due to the removal of natural moisture barrier; the skin. The variations of thermal diffusivity have been plotted and correlations developed.

The laboratory studies were conducted to test the system and evaluate the performance of the prototypes. Two ionization systems were designed and tested in an air quality laboratory chamber. In the first system a high voltage negative ionization electrode and a neutral collector were used to charge and collect the dust from the air. Samples were obtained with the systems on and <b>off.</b> <b>Samples</b> were also obtained to compare the effectiveness of the second ionization system and an ionization system manufactured by Alpine. Two methods were used to analyze the dust concentration to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems in reducing the dust concentration. A graphical method (slope) and a mathematical method were used to evaluate the effectiveness in dust removal;The second system resulted in a significantly higher reduction of airborne dust concentration than the first. Also the study showed that the removal rate of dust particles by the ionization systems increased as the particle size increased. Also the study showed that the Alpine ionization system was much less effective in removing dust from the air than the second prototype ionization system;The study also evaluated the effect of wire sizes on electron generation of the ionization systems. The study showed that the static voltage increases as (1) the applied voltage increased, (2) the distance between the collector and discharge electrode decrease, and (3) the wire radius decreased.

For parameter learning, we analyze several methods and produce PAC learnability results for certain classes of CRFs. Structured composite likelihood estimation proves particularly successful in both theory and practice, and our results offer guidance for optimizing estimator structure. For structure learning, we develop a maximum-weight spanning tree-based method which outperforms other methods for recovering tree CRFs. In the secon...|$|R
