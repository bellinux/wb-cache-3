However, {{in the design of}} the reinforced concrete structures, the extreme loads generated by terrorist attacks or accidental explosions were usually ignored that made the structures particularly vulnerable when they are subjected to these loading conditions. When a specific blast load is applied, RC columns usually suffer localized failure (spalling) and exhibit global deformation due to shear and flexural bending that depend <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>characteristics</b> and structural parameters (Crawford and Magallanes 2011). In addition, certain residual axial load carrying capacity may still remain, which provides the main basis for assessing of damage level and collapse risk for structures under blast loading (Brunesi et al. 2015; Parisi 2015; Petrone et al. 2016; Russo and Parisi 2016). Therefore, it is quite essential to develop a more precise numerical model for post-blast response of RC columns.|$|R

Differences in characteristics have primarily been studied from a footwear perspective with limited research describing the effects of ethnicity <b>on</b> dynamic foot <b>loading.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of ethnicity <b>on</b> <b>loading</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the paediatric foot. Methods: Dynamic plantar pressures were measured in 93 children aged 7 - 11 years (mean age 9. 4 + 1. 6 years) using the MatScan® 3150 pressure platform. Participants were recruited from local schools in East London and stratified into four ethnic groups (white, mixed, black and asian). Mean peak plantar pressure at six different segments across the plantar foot was calculated from three walking trials using the midgait protocol. Multiple linear regression was used to test for ethnic effects, whilst controlling for gender and body mass. Results: Significant differences for mean pressure at the lateral heel (p = ˂ 0. 05) and the medial heel (p = ˂ 0. 05) were identified. These were principally driven by differences between the mixed ethnic group for loading at the medial heel (p = ˂ 0. 05), which showed significantly lower mean peak pressure than the white ethnic group. Significantly lower peak pressures were also identified at the lateral heel for both the mixed (p = ˂ 0. 05) and black (p = ˂ 0. 05) ethnic groups. Conclusion: Significant differences in peak plantar pressure across the heel were identified in an ethnically diverse sample of children aged 7 - 11 years from East London. These findings suggest that differences in foot <b>loading</b> <b>characteristics</b> exist between the groups and may be explained by variances in foot position during gait.

30|$|As the {{renewable}} penetration keeps increasing, {{the voltage}} rise problem becomes greater and causes voltage regulation problems. New voltage regulation devices {{are essential to}} improve the feeder voltage profile and meet the power quality requirements of critical customers. The electric spring (ES) was introduced in [16] to implement Hooke’s law for electrical systems. The device can facilitate non-critical loads to provide grid services in respect of voltage and frequency. The general performance of the ES has been demonstrated in [17, 18]. The results verified the capability and flexibility of the ES in supporting the voltage of a bus where critical “load” is allocated. According to [7, 16], the term “critical” load refers to an electric load that requires a well-regulated mains voltage. However, the original version of the ES has two limitations: ① it is better at a supporting function to prevent under-voltage than a suppressing function to prevent over-voltage; ② its voltage regulation performance depends strongly <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A {{new version of the}} ES with a back-to-back converter (ESBC) configuration has been designed to overcome these limitations and extend the operational flexibility [19]. The operating principle and extended operation range of this back-to-back electric spring has been explained in [20]. The key issue to facilitate it to provide an effective voltage regulation service is to decide the best operating points within the full range of its operating region.|$|R
