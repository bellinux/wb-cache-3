Although we cannot prove Saito’s conjecture, we can show in this paper that if 3 ≤ k ≤ 7, G has a heterochromatic path <b>of</b> length <b>at</b> <b>least</b> k − 1, and if k ≥ 8, G has a heterochromatic path <b>of</b> length <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ⌈ 3 k 5 ⌉ + 1.

40|$|Grotzsch {{proved that}} every triangle-free planar graph is 3 -colorable. Thomassen proved that every planar graph <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five is 3 -choosable. As for other surfaces, Thomassen proved {{that there are}} only finitely many 4 -critical graphs <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five {{embeddable}} in any fixed surface. This implies a linear-time algorithm for deciding 3 -colorablity for graphs <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five on any fixed surface. Dvorak, Kral and Thomas strengthened Thomassen's result by proving that the number of vertices in a 4 -critical graph <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five is linear in its genus. They used this result to prove Havel's conjecture that a planar graph whose triangles are pairwise far enough apart is 3 -colorable. As for list-coloring, Dvorak proved that a planar graph whose cycles <b>of</b> size <b>at</b> most four are pairwise far enough part is 3 -choosable. In this article, we generalize these results. First we prove a linear isoperimetric bound for 3 -list-coloring graphs <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five. Many new results then follow from the theory of hyperbolic families of graphs developed by Postle and Thomas. In particular, it follows {{that there are only}} finitely many 4 -list-critical graphs <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five on any fixed surface, and that in fact the number of vertices of a 4 -list-critical graph is linear in its genus. This provides independent proofs of the above results while generalizing Dvorak's result to graphs on surfaces that have large edge-width and yields a similar result showing that a graph <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five with crossings pairwise far apart is 3 -choosable. Finally, we generalize to surfaces Thomassen's result that every planar graph <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five has exponentially many distinct 3 -list-colorings. Specifically, we show that every graph <b>of</b> girth <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five that has a 3 -list-coloring has 2 ^Ω(n) -O(g) distinct 3 -list-colorings. Comment: 33 page...|$|R
