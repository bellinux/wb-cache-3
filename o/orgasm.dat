5|$|Common {{problems}} {{women experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving <b>orgasm.</b> Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach <b>orgasm,</b> usually when their genitals are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of <b>orgasm</b> {{to be the same}} as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve <b>orgasm.</b> In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at <b>orgasm</b> and SCI, the term phantom <b>orgasm</b> was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at <b>orgasm,</b> such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience <b>orgasm</b> with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve <b>orgasm.</b> The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve <b>orgasm.</b> In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach <b>orgasm</b> using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral <b>orgasms</b> are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal <b>orgasms</b> had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral <b>orgasms,</b> while a minority achieved vaginal <b>orgasms.</b> On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of <b>orgasms,</b> reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|R
2500|$|Wallen K and Lloyd EA stated, [...] "In men, <b>orgasms</b> {{are under}} strong {{selective}} pressure as <b>orgasms</b> are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's <b>orgasms</b> in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure {{as they are}} not a reproductive necessity." ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>orgasms</b> {{that result}} from {{stimulation}} of the AFE zone {{are thought to be}} distinct from the <b>orgasms</b> {{that result from}} stimulation of the clitoris, but some women who have experienced them say that they are similar in sensation to <b>orgasms</b> achieved by G-spot stimulation, while others say that they are more [...] "intense".|$|R
5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing <b>orgasm.</b> The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an <b>orgasm.</b> They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving <b>orgasm.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an <b>orgasm.</b> A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if <b>orgasm</b> has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If <b>orgasm</b> is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after <b>orgasm,</b> making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human <b>orgasm.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{individuals}} have reported that they have experienced sexual excitement during sexual activity, including masturbation. The ability to obtain <b>orgasms</b> is positively associated with sexual satisfaction. Frequency and intensity of <b>orgasms</b> are substantially different among transsexual men and transsexual women. Almost all female-to-male individuals have revealed an increase in sexual excitement and are capable of achieving <b>orgasms</b> through sexual activity with a partner or via masturbation, whereas only 85% of the male-to-female individuals are able to achieve <b>orgasms</b> after SRS. A study found that both transmen and transwomen {{reported that they had}} experienced transformation in their <b>orgasms</b> sensuality. The female-to-male transgender individuals reported that they had been experiencing intensified and stronger excitements while male-to-female individuals have been encountering longer and more gentle feelings.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his <b>orgasm</b> theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the <b>orgasm</b> as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach <b>orgasm,</b> though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female <b>orgasm.</b> The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including <b>orgasm,</b> solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone oxytocin. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple <b>orgasms</b> in an adult man was conducted at Rutgers University in 1995. During the study, six fully ejaculatory <b>orgasms</b> were experienced in 36 minutes, with no apparent refractory period. Later, P.

5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving <b>orgasm.</b> She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach <b>orgasm.</b> McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve <b>orgasm</b> with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to <b>orgasm</b> than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of <b>orgasm</b> in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving <b>orgasm</b> were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach <b>orgasm</b> using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E

50|$|According to some studies, 18-year-old {{males have}} a {{refractory}} {{period of about}} 15 minutes, while those in their 70s take about 20 hours, with the average for all men being about a half-hour. Although rarer, some males exhibit no refractory period or a refractory period lasting less than 10 seconds.

5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, <b>orgasm,</b> and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to <b>orgasm</b> is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by <b>orgasm.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for <b>orgasm</b> in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and <b>orgasm</b> through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E

5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects <b>orgasm,</b> erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and <b>orgasm.</b> People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
