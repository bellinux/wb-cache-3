Usually {{vegetable}} oil is used, but butter, <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the tava, so it softens but does not break.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, food {{preparation}} was overseen by a qualified chef, who also trained prisoners. The diet consisted of quality food, but [...] "without trimmings". Breakfast was porridge, {{with a third}} of a pint of milk, a hot drink (tea, unless the prisoner bought coffee or cocoa), and either Vegemite, honey, <b>or</b> <b>margarine,</b> depending on the week. Lunch and dinner had more variation. Both meals consisted of a meat dish – corned beef, sausages, or mince pie – as well as mashed potato and cabbage, although there was occasionally a roast dinner. Meat, vegetables and bread were still a prominent part of the diet in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} English words of non-Romance origin where [...] is hard though {{followed}} by [...] or [...] (e.g. get, gift), {{and a few}} in which [...] is soft though followed by [...] such as gaol <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One {{particularly}} notorious {{example of}} this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about [...] "Movie Popcorn", which {{became the subject of}} a widespread publicity campaign. The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with butter <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> [...] "A medium-size buttered popcorn", the report said, [...] "contains more fat than a breakfast of bacon and eggs, a Big Mac and fries, and a steak dinner combined." [...] The practice continues today. For example, according to DietFacts.com, a small popcorn from Regal Cinema Group (the largest theater chain in the United States) still contains 29 g of saturated fat. the equivalent of a full day-and-a-half's reference daily intake.|$|E

50|$|Interesterified fat {{is a type}} of oil {{where the}} fatty acids have been moved from one {{triglyceride}} molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the melting point, slow rancidification and create an oil more suitable for deep frying <b>or</b> making <b>margarine</b> with good taste and low saturated fat content. It {{is not the same as}} partial hydrogenation which produces trans fatty acids, but interesterified fats used in the food industry can come from hydrogenated fat, for simplicity and frugality.|$|R
5000|$|A popular filling snack with British troops {{since at}} least World War I, the [...] "egg banjo" [...] is a {{sandwich}} of a runny fried egg between two thick slices of bread (if possible, buttered <b>or</b> with <b>margarine),</b> often accompanied by a mug of [...] "gunfire".

2500|$|Another item {{prepared}} like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake {{seems to}} be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes {{from other parts of the}} West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs ("western" [...] style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies including Trinidad, Barbados and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a [...] "bake and shark" [...] is a popular street food sandwich in which fried shark is sandwiched between two halves of a sliced bake with a plethora of local condiments.

5000|$|It {{is based}} on a [...] "half-fat-to-flour" [...] ratio (twice as much flour as fat by weight). Fat (lard, shortening, butter <b>or</b> full-fat <b>margarine)</b> is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water, rolled out, then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or pie. Ideally, equal amounts of butter and lard are used to make the pastry, {{ensuring}} that the ratio of the two fat products is half that of the flour. The butter is employed to give the pastry a rich flavor, whilst the lard ensures optimum texture.|$|R

Disks are cut from the end, shaped to form pockets, and filled. The pastry is baked until the layers separate, forming the sfogliatella's characteristic ridges.|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} catalytic {{vacuum distillation}} process is used under high temperature conditions to isomerize linoleic acid in triacylglyceride vegetable oils to CLA to produce CLA-rich oils. After processing, the catalyst may be removed by filtration or centrifugation to obtain high quality, CLA-rich oils. The CLA-rich oils may then {{serve as a}} potent and bioactive nutraceutical and {{can be incorporated into}} various food products, such as a CLA-rich dressing, <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> chips...|$|R

Studies {{have indicated that}} consumption of about 2-3 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10-15%.
