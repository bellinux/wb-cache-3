Valerian questions Nova when she returned to the Dominion after being missing for some time. Valerian believes her claim, that she didn't betray the Dominion and grants her her own covert ops team to discover what the Defenders of Man are up to. After Nova learns, that the Defenders are using psi emitters to lure zerg to Dominion Worlds to discredit him, and learning the identity of their leader, General Davis, Valerian contacts her and announces his wish to step down as the Emperor of the Dominion.|$|E

500|$|Extreme {{isolation}} from society and community is also apparent in Crane's work. [...] During {{the most intense}} battle scenes in The Red Badge of Courage, for example, the story's focus is mainly [...] "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others". In [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "An Experiment in Misery" [...] and other stories, Crane uses light, motion and color to express degrees of epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. [...] "The Open Boat", for example, distances itself from Romantic optimism and affirmation of man's {{place in the world}} by concentrating on the characters' isolation.|$|E

The hearing was conducted by Frederick Solly Flood, Attorney General of Gibraltar who was also Advocate-General and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty. Flood was described by a historian of the Mary Celeste affair as a man [...] "whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ", and as [...] "...the sort <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> once he had {{made up his mind}} about something, couldn't be shifted." [...] The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed, a belief picked up by the New York Shipping and Commercial List on December 21: [...] "The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere, and that alcohol is at the bottom of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E

He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment".

500|$|Similar {{to other}} Naturalist works, [...] "The Open Boat" [...] scrutinizes the {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> has been isolated {{not only from}} society, but also from God and nature. The struggle between man and the natural world is the most apparent theme in the work, and while the characters at first believe the turbulent sea to be a hostile force set against them, they {{come to believe that}} nature is instead ambivalent. At the beginning of the last section, the correspondent rethinks his view of nature's hostility: [...] "the serenity of nature amid the struggles of the individual—nature in the wind, and nature in the vision of men. She did not seem cruel to him, nor beneficent, nor treacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent." [...] The correspondent regularly refers to the sea with feminine pronouns, pitting the four men in the boat against an intangible, yet effeminate, threat; critic Leedice Kissane further pointed to the story's seeming denigration of women, noting the castaways' personification of Fate as [...] "an old ninny-woman" [...] and [...] "an old hen". That nature is ultimately disinterested is an idea that appears in other works by Crane; a poem from Crane's 1899 collection War is Kind and Other Lines also echoes Crane's common theme of universal indifference: ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{his injury}} in 1924, Gilligan {{could no longer}} bowl fast and, as a player, had little {{influence}} on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan [...] "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, {{for the first time}} since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan [...] "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan [...] "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as [...] "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the [...] "type <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> in the most unostentatious way, can do more than all the politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an [...] "Empire builder".|$|E
