The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) {{repeated}} {{its highly}} controversial decision which it initially {{took in the}} local elections to print {{a substantial amount of}} ballot papers more than necessary, totalling 75,708,180. It was reported that the YSK had printed 18 million more ballot papers more than the total number of registered voters. The YSK responded to questions regarding its decision by stating that it was required by law to print extra ballot papers. The YSK president Sadi Güven also stated that the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would vote at customs gates was also a factor behind the decision to send a disproportionately large number of ballot papers to national borders. However, the OSCE stated that there was no legal basis for printing such a large amount of ballot papers.|$|E
25|$|Many events {{illustrate}} {{violence and}} resistance as Aborigines sought {{to protect their}} lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town. The British established a new outpost in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1803. Although Tasmanian history is amongst the most contested by modern historians, conflict between colonists and Aborigines was referred to in some contemporary accounts as the Black War. The combined effects of disease, dispossession, intermarriage and conflict saw a collapse of the Aboriginal population of Tasmania from a few thousand people when the British arrived, to a few hundred by the 1830s. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were killed during the period begin at around 300, though verification of the true figure is now impossible. In 1830 Governor Sir George Arthur sent an armed party (the Black Line) to push the Big River and Oyster Bay tribes out of the British settled districts. The effort failed and George Augustus Robinson proposed to set out unarmed to mediate with the remaining tribespeople in 1833. With the assistance of Truganini as guide and translator, Robinson convinced remaining tribesmen to surrender to an isolated new settlement at Flinders Island, where most later died of disease.|$|E

The board consisted of Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Secretary of the Navy Robeson, Commodore Reynolds, Captain Henry W. Howgate of the Army, and Spencer F. Baird of the Academy of Sciences. Tyson was the first to appear for questioning, and related the friction between Hall, Budington, and Bessels, and Hall's deathbed accusations of poisoning. The board also inquired about the whereabouts of Hall's journals and records. Tyson responded that while Hall was delirious, he instructed Budington to burn some of the papers, and the rest had disappeared. Later, journals of other crew members were discovered {{at the site of the}} Polaris wreck, but these had the sections regarding Hall's death cut out. Meyer testified to Budington's drinking, saying that the sailing master was [...] "drunk most always while we were going southward".

500|$|Chuck Kleinhans {{states that}} the {{difference}} between a guilty pleasure and a cult film {{can be as simple as}} the number of fans; David Church raises the question <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> it takes to form a cult following, especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count. [...] As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. [...] Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. [...] Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. [...] Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. [...] This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. [...] Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. [...] Smith {{states that the}} early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. [...] Films such as [...] Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. [...] Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Redhead murders" [...] are {{a series}} of unsolved homicides {{believed}} to have been committed by an unidentified serial killer {{in various parts of the}} United States, including Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi and Pennsylvania.

2500|$|Lee {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Dracula in Hammer's [...] (1965). Lee's role has no lines, he merely hisses his way through the film. Stories vary as to the reason for this: Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given, but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character. This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film's running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula's resurrection and the character's appearances were brief. Lee went on record to state that he was virtually [...] "blackmailed" [...] by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films; unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate, they would resort to reminding him <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> he would put out of work, if he did not take part.|$|E

According to Iranian PressTV, Carlo Rosati, an FBI firearms expert witness, doubted whether the M-4 rifle was ever fired at the crime scene; an FBI agent testified that Siddiqui's fingerprints were not found on the rifle. The prosecution argued that it was not unusual to fail to get fingerprints off a gun. [...] "This is a crime that was committed in a war zone, a chaotic and uncontrolled environment 6,000 miles away from here." [...] Gul's testimony appeared, according to the defence, to differ from that given by Snyder with regard to whether Siddiqui was standing or on her knees as she fired the rifle.

2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{computerised}} racing game {{is known}} as Trackside, where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours. Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses, but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, {{along with the other}} SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext, but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also [...] "mystery" [...] bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.|$|E
