5|$|Wulfstan {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} and effective Old English prose writers. His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres, including homilies (or sermons), secular laws, religious canons, and political theory. With Ælfric of Eynsham, he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh-century England, a period which, ecclesiastically, was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform. The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy, a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Reform promoted a regular (i.e. based on a regula, or rule) life for priests and clerics, a strict church hierarchy, the primacy of the Roman see, the authority of codified or canonical church law, and stressed the importance of catholic, that is universal, church practices throughout all Christendom. These ideas could only thrive in a social and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy's and the laity's obedience to the authority of the church <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> spiritual, and also on many things secular and juridical. This {{was one of the}} main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan's legal and quasi-legal writings. But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that, in order for this Reform model to thrive in England, the English clergy and laity (especially the laity) needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith. Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen's steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices, like, for example, knowledge of Christ's life and passion, memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles' Creed, proper baptism, and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass. It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices, that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity.|$|E

500|$|Leng credits {{all three}} {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison, although other sources suggest that Peter Frampton may have participated at the session. Harrison also overdubbed all the backing vocals (credited {{on the album}} to [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers"), a feat much admired by Spector, who has noted Harrison's willingness to [...] "experiment upon experiment" [...] with his harmony singing <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|Simon Leng {{describes}} Harrison's various musical activities {{outside the}} Beatles during 1968–70 as a [...] "three-year busman's holiday", {{which came to}} an end once McCartney announced his departure from the band on 10 April 1970. Before beginning work <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass with co-producer Phil Spector, Harrison attended a session for Dylan's New Morning album in New York City, on 1 May. With backing from Charlie Daniels and Russ Kunkel, Dylan and Harrison recorded a version of [...] "If Not for You", a new song of Dylan's that Harrison subsequently covered <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, and two tracks that appear on New Morning: [...] "Went to See the Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Day of the Locusts". Although it was not a song they played at Columbia's Studio B that day, Harrison and Dylan recorded a demo of [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] during a jam session held at Dylan's Greenwich Village townhouse on 30 April, with Kunkel accompanying them on bongos. The song was one of many tracks that Harrison had already shortlisted for his own album, recording for which began at London's Abbey Road Studios in late May.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{also features}} prominent percussion such as tambourine and maracas. While the precise line-up {{on many of}} the songs <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass continues to invite conjecture, Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins has said that Spector nicknamed him [...] "Mr Tambourine Man" [...] due to his role on that instrument throughout the sessions, and that he and future Yes drummer Alan White played most of the percussion parts on the album, [...] "switch on tambourine, sticks, bells, maracas... whatever was needed".|$|E
500|$|Although Harrison had {{estimated}} in a New York radio {{interview that the}} solo album would take no more than eight weeks to complete, recording, overdubbing and mixing <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass lasted for five months, until late October. Part {{of the reason for}} this was Harrison's need to make regular visits to Liverpool to tend to his mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer. Participants at the recording sessions identify Spector's erratic behaviour as another factor affecting progress on the album. Harrison later referred to Spector needing [...] "eighteen cherry brandies" [...] before he could start work, a situation that forced much of the production duties onto Harrison alone. In July 1970, by which time sessions had resumed at Trident Studios, Spector fell over in the studio and broke his arm. Early that month, work <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass was temporarily brought to a halt as Harrison headed north to see his dying mother for the last time. EMI's growing concerns regarding studio costs added to the pressure on Harrison, and a further complication, John Harris notes, was that Clapton had become infatuated with Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, and adopted a heroin habit as a means of coping with his guilt.|$|E
500|$|Basic {{tracks for}} this and the other songs were taped at Abbey Road Studios {{with some of the}} musicians who had played <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass – {{including}} Jim Gordon, Klaus Voormann and Gary Wright – along with Leon Russell on piano. The recording was not completed, however, since Phil Spector's erratic behaviour led to the project being abandoned. Issued on Apple Records in April 1971, the single [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] was the only official Ronnie Spector release from these sessions.|$|E

500|$|Defying pop {{convention}} – as the Band's Music from Big Pink had in July 1968, {{by opening}} with the funereal [...] "Tears of Rage" [...] – Harrison selected the slow, gentle [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] as track 1 <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, which {{was released on}} Apple Records in late November 1970. He later attributed the message behind its opening line, [...] "Let me in here", as his motivation for placing the song first in the running order, along with the confidence engendered by Dylan and Clapton's involvement.|$|E
500|$|Harrison and Dylan wrote {{at least}} one other song {{together}} during Thanksgiving 1968: [...] "When Everybody Comes to Town", subsequently renamed [...] "Nowhere to Go". Dylan also showed Harrison [...] "I Don't Want to Do It", which, like [...] "Nowhere to Go", Harrison would later consider for inclusion <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass but discard. As for Dylan's future output, songs such as [...] "I Threw It All Away" [...] on Nashville Skyline (1969) showed a more complex musical structure than before, a departure from his usual three-chord compositions.|$|E
500|$|Madinger and Easter view [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} [...] "heavily Spectorized" [...] {{productions}} <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, due to Spector's liberal use of echo and other Wall of Sound techniques. Among the extensive overdubs on the basic track, Harrison added what Leng terms a [...] "virtual guitar orchestra" [...] of harmonised slide guitar parts, and former Delaney & Bonnie musicians Jim Price and Bobby Keys supplied horns. Whitlock and Clapton sang backing vocals with Harrison, credited on the album as [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers".|$|E

500|$|The {{musicians who}} {{performed}} <b>on</b> Harrison's <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass {{version of the}} song {{are believed to be}} as follows: ...|$|R
500|$|Since {{its initial}} release <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] has {{appeared}} on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison and 2009's career-spanning [...] The original UK single (with [...] "What Is Life" [...] as the B-side) was reissued on Christmas Eve 1976 in Britain – a [...] "provocative" [...] move by EMI, given the publicity the lawsuit had attracted that year for the song. The song appears in the 2017 Marvel Studios sequel film, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it is included on the movie's soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|As {{a gentle}} ballad, [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] went against pop-music {{convention}} of the time for an album opener. The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector in London and features a much-admired lead guitar part by Eric Clapton. With the strong public association that existed between Harrison and Dylan by 1970, some music critics remarked on the American singer's presence <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass, {{even though he did}} not contribute to the album. Harrison and Dylan went on to enjoy further collaborations after writing the song, culminating in their recording together as members of the Traveling Wilburys in 1988–90.|$|E
500|$|Spector {{first heard}} Harrison's {{stockpile}} of unreleased compositions early in 1970, when visiting his recently purchased home, Friar Park. [...] "It was endless!" [...] Spector later recalled of the recital, noting {{the quantity and}} quality of Harrison's material. Harrison had accumulated songs from as far back as 1966; both [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and [...] "Art of Dying" [...] date from that year. He co-wrote at least two songs with Dylan while in Woodstock, one of which, [...] "I'd Have You Anytime", appeared <b>on</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> Must Pass. Harrison wrote [...] "Let It Down" [...] in late 1968 also.|$|E
