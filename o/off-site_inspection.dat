40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) results and analysis from the inspection of composite specimens representing typical helicopter parts. The specimens include monolithic laminates produced from carbon {{fiber reinforced plastic}} (CFRP), Nomex honeycomb core sandwich panels with CFRP skins, and CFRP frame-skin joint panels. External protection layers comprising copper mesh and fiberglass were {{also included in the}} specimens. These panels were fabricated {{with a wide range of}} defects to simulate helicopter in-service damage including delamination and skin-core disbond along with barely visible impact damage. The study aims to assess a number of conventional and emerging NDT techniques suitable for rapid in situ and <b>off-site</b> <b>inspection</b> of helicopter composite structures. The techniques considered are flash and sonic thermography, radiography, and different ultrasonic inspection modes including pulse-echo, through-transmission, and phased array. These techniques are compared on their ability to detect and characterize the fabricated defects...|$|E

As a regulator and supervisor of the Indian banking system it ensures financial stability & {{public confidence in the}} banking system. RBI uses methods like On-site <b>inspections,</b> <b>off-site</b> surveillance, scrutiny & periodic meetings to supervise new bank licenses, setting capital requirements and regulating interest rates in specific areas. RBI is currently focused on implementing Basel III norms.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{is crucial}} to {{maintain}} wind turbine blades regularly, due to the high stress leading to defects or even damage. Conventional methods require shipping the blades to a workshop for <b>inspection</b> <b>off-site,</b> which is extremely time-consuming and very costly. This work investigates using pulse-echo ultrasound to detect internal damages in wind turbine blades without the necessity to ship the blades off-site. A prototype of 2 D ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) system has been developed and optimised for in-situ wind turbine blade inspection. The system {{is designed to be}} light weight so it can be easily carried by an inspector climbing onto the wind turbine blade for in-situ inspection. It can be operated in 1 D A-Scan, 2 D C-Scan or 3 D Volume Scan. A software system has been developed to control the automated scanning and show the damage areas in a 2 D/ 3 D map with different colours so that the inspector can easily identify the damage areas. Experiments on Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastics (GFRP) and wind turbine blades (made of GFRP) samples showed that internal defects can be detected. The main advantages of this system are fully automated 2 D spatial scanning and flaw displaying. It is potentially to be used for in-situ inspection to save maintenance time and hence considered to be economically beneficial for the wind energy industry...|$|R
