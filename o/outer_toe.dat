5|$|Rollers {{resemble}} crows in {{size and}} build, but are {{more closely related to}} the kingfishers and bee-eaters. They share the colourful appearance of those groups with blues and browns predominating. The two inner front toes are connected, but the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> is not.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's small bill is {{used for}} {{plucking}} feathers and pulling prey apart, rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> is [...] "fairly long and slender"; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick. The middle toe is very long {{and can be used}} to grasp objects, while a protuberance {{on the underside of the}} toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.|$|E
2500|$|Their skin {{varies in}} colour {{depending}} on the subspecies, with some having light or dark gray skin and others having pinkish or even reddish skin. The strong legs of the common ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the tarsus (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The tarsus of the common ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring [...] in length. The bird has just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with {{the nail on the}} larger, inner toe resembling a hoof. The <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over [...] and can cover [...] in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (6ft 7 in), and the wing chord measurement of [...] is around the same size as for the largest flying birds.|$|E
50|$|Pamprodactyly is an {{arrangement}} {{in which all}} four <b>toes</b> point forward, <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> (toe 1 and sometimes 4) often if not regularly reversible. It is a characteristic of swifts (Apodidae) and mousebirds (Coliiformes).|$|R

50|$|Hipparion {{resembled the}} modern horse, but still had two vestigal <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> (in {{addition}} to its hoof) which did not touch the ground. Hipparion was about 1.4 m tall at the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|We note, first, {{that the}} {{variations}} of {{none of the}} parts follow the variations of the body, but are sometimes almost in an opposite direction. Thus the longest wing corresponds to a rather small body, the longest tail to a medium body, while the longest leg and toes belong to only a moderately large body. Again, even related parts do not constantly vary together but present many instances of independent variation, {{as shown by the}} want of parallelism in their respective variation-lines. In No. 5 (see Fig. 4) the wing is very long, the tail moderately so; while in No. 6 the wing is much shorter while the tail is considerably longer. The tarsus presents comparatively little variation; and although the three toes may be said to vary in general together, there are many divergencies; thus, in passing from No. 9 to No. 10, the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> becomes longer, while the hind toe becomes considerably shorter; while in Nos. 3 and 4 the middle toe varies in an opposite way to the outer and the hind toes.|$|E
60|$|The first bird taken is {{the common}} Bob-o-link or Rice-bird (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and the Diagram, Fig. 4, {{exhibits}} the variations of seven important characters in twenty male adult specimens.[21] These characters are--the lengths of the body, wing, tail, tarsus, middle toe, <b>outer</b> <b>toe,</b> and hind toe, being as many as can be conveniently exhibited in one diagram. The length {{of the body is}} not given by Mr. Allen, but as it forms a convenient standard of comparison, it has been obtained by deducting the length of the tail from the total length of the birds as given by him. The diagram has been constructed as follows:--The twenty specimens are first arranged in a series according to the body-lengths (which may be considered to give the size of the bird), from the shortest to the longest, and the same number of vertical lines are drawn, numbered from one to twenty. In this case (and wherever practicable) the body-length is measured from the lower line of the diagram, so that the actual length of the bird is exhibited as well as the actual variations of length. These can be well estimated by means of the horizontal line drawn at the mean between the two extremes, and it will be seen that one-fifth {{of the total number of}} specimens taken on either side exhibits a very large amount of variation, which would of course be very much greater if a hundred or more specimens were compared. The lengths of the wing, tail, and other parts are then laid down, and the diagram thus exhibits at a glance the comparative variation of these parts in every specimen as well as the actual amount of variation in the twenty specimens; and we are thus enabled to arrive at some important conclusions.|$|E

50|$|The 5.2 ft, {{creature}} closely {{resembled a}} deer, having two hooved toes and reaching a weight over 60 kg. Like early horses, such as Merychippus, it had two vestigal <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> on each foot, {{which did not}} touch the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet pedatifida means [...] "pedately-cleft" [...] in botanical Latin, {{in reference}} to the leaves, which look like a bird's foot with the <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> again parted.

Usually given in Shoulder/Slope Arms or Present Arms position.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Langshan {{is a small}} black, blue {{or white}} bird, with an upright carriage, long legs and {{medium-sized}} straight comb, which should be red. Ideally, the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> of each foot should be feathered. The black variety is a glossy black with green sheen, while the blue colour should be an even grey-blue, although males often have dark blue on the tail or hackles. White Australian Langshans are pure white.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{the genus}} have earlier been placed under other genus names {{including}} Macrotarsius (Blyth), Chalcopterus (Reich.) and Hemerodromus (Heuglin). Some characteristics of this largely African genus include {{a bill that}} is shorter and stouter than in Cursorius, the orbits are feathered and the 2nd and 3rd primaries nearly equal and the longest. The tarsus is long and scutellate, the feet are short and the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> is joined by partial webbing.|$|E
50|$|Evidence against sauropod ancestry within Prosauropoda {{comes from}} the fact that prosauropods had a smaller <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> on their hind feet than the sauropods. Many {{maintain}} that it is easier for digits to be reduced or lost during evolution than the reverse; however, there is no evidence for this. The lengthening, or gaining of extra digits is common in marine reptiles, and within the theropods digit lengthening occurred at least once. Therefore, using this as evidence against ancestral prosauropods is questionable.|$|E
50|$|Head {{and body}} length is 7-9cm. Tail is 10-12cm. Reddish brown upperparts grading {{on the sides}} to light {{yellowish}} brown. Underparts are light brownish white. Long tail is dark, and slender with no tuft at tip. Largish hind feet with nails instead of claws on the <b>outer</b> <b>toes,</b> which are opposable.|$|R
6000|$|In Equus, finally, the crowns of the grinding-teeth become longer, {{and their}} {{patterns}} are slightly modified; {{the middle of}} the shaft of the ulna usually vanishes, and its proximal and distal ends ankylose with the radius. The phalanges of the two <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> in each foot disappear, their metacarpal and metatarsal bones being left as the [...] "splints." ...|$|R
5000|$|Diadiaphorus closely {{resembled a}} horse, but was only around 1.2 m in body length with a weight 70 kg, {{similar to a}} modern sheep. It had three toes, only one of which touched the ground. This toe had a large hoof; the two <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> were rudimentary, much like those of early horses such as Merychippus. Unlike horses, however, Diadiaphorus lacked fused limb bones. Its skull was short and had a {{relatively}} large brain cavity. Judging from its low molars, Diadiaphorus ate soft vegetation, such as leaves.|$|R
5000|$|The turacos make up {{the bird}} family Musophagidae (literally [...] "banana-eaters"), which {{includes}} plantain-eaters and go-away-birds. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds {{are commonly known as}} loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous - the fourth (<b>outer)</b> <b>toe</b> can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{systematic}} {{assignment of}} the genus (apart from the problems posed by [...] "N." [...] kistneri) is not well resolved. Initially, the genus (at that time only comprising the type species) {{was considered to be}} a passeriform. [...] "N." [...] kistneri was described 60 years later as a species {{of the genus}} Primobucco, which then thought to be related to woodpeckers because it had a zygodactyl foot or at least could turn the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> backwards; some years later, several genera (including Primobucco and Neanis) were put into a new family, the Primobucconidae, which were thought to be a primitive kind of puffbird.|$|E
50|$|They are slender greyish {{or brown}} birds with soft, hairlike body feathers. They are {{typically}} about 10 cm in body length, with a long, thin tail a further 20-24 cm in length, and weigh 45-55 grams. They are arboreal and scurry {{through the leaves}} like rodents, in search of berries, fruit and buds. This habit, and their legs, {{gives rise to the}} group's English name. They are acrobatic, and can feed upside down. All species have strong claws and reversible <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> (pamprodactyl feet). They also have crests and stubby bills.|$|R
2500|$|Approximately 50 {{million years}} ago, in the early-to-middle Eocene, Eohippus {{smoothly}} transitioned into Orohippus through a gradual series of changes. Although its name means [...] "mountain horse", Orohippus {{was not a}} true horse and did not live in the mountains. It resembled Eohippus in size, but had a slimmer body, an elongated head, slimmer forelimbs, and longer hind legs, {{all of which are}} characteristics of a good jumper. Although Orohippus was still pad-footed, the vestigial <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> of Eohippus were not present in Orohippus; there were four toes on each fore leg, and three on each hind leg.|$|R
50|$|The Croad Langshan {{is large}} in body, {{has a deep}} and long breast which is carried well forward; the back is rather long and sloping with the tail rising sharply from the back, giving the {{characteristic}} 'U' shape. The head is small compared to the body size, the beak is light to dark horn in colour; the comb is medium-sized, single and carried upright in both sexes. The shanks and <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> are slightly feathered. In the original birds the males topped 10 lb/4.5 kg; today cocks weigh 9.5 lbs/3.75-4.25 kg and hens 7.5 lbs/3-3.5 kg. Hatching eggs should weigh at least 58g.|$|R
50|$|In 1929 {{a type of}} {{dwarfism}} {{was described}} in different breeds of Rhode Island Red chickens. This type of dwarfism produced individuals which showed a general growth delay, which was recognizable since {{two or three weeks}} of age. The <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> was curved backwards. The skull was high and wide in relation to its length and the upper beak was curved downwards. Tongue was shortened and tumescent. Legs shortened, more in the matatarsal than in the femur. The condition was semi-lethal. None of the affected birds reached sexual maturity. It was considered {{as the result of a}} dysfunction of the thyroid gland, similar to the human pathological condition known as myxoedema infantilis. Dwarfs of this type were homozygotes for an autosomal recessive gene td (thyrogenous dwarfism).|$|E
50|$|The western osprey differs {{in several}} respects from other diurnal birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its tarsi are reticulate, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The western osprey and owls {{are the only}} raptors whose <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> is reversible, {{allowing}} them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. Some schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae—which itself {{can be regarded as}} making up the bulk of the order Accipitriformes or else be lumped with the Falconidae into Falconiformes. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this results in an unnatural paraphyletic classification.|$|E
50|$|While it was {{originally}} described as having a hooked, raptorial beak, the specimen is badly preserved, and further research suggested that it instead had a normal, toothed, and probably elongated snout like other longipterygids. Though the only known specimen is very poorly preserved, in nearly all features that can be compared between the two, Boluochia is indistinguishable from a juvenile specimen of Longipteryx. Jingmai O'Connor and colleagues, in a 2010 re-study of the specimen, could find only one concrete feature to distinguish them: in Boluochia, the fourth metatarsal diverges significantly from the others, causing the <b>outer</b> <b>toe</b> {{to be separated from}} the rest when perched. The researchers who noted this characteristic argued that it was not likely to be a deformity because it was present on both feet, and {{that it was not a}} juvenile characteristic, as it is not seen in known juvenile specimens of Longipteryx.|$|E
60|$|I have {{observed}} {{another case of}} correlation which at first sight appears quite inexplicable, but on which, {{as we shall see}} in a future chapter, some light can be thrown by the law of homologous parts varying in the same manner. The case is, that, when the feet are much feathered, the roots of the feathers are connected by a web of skin, and apparently in correlation with this the two <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> become connected for a considerable space by skin. I {{have observed}} this in very many specimens of Pouters, Trumpeters, Swallows, Roller-tumblers (likewise observed in this breed by Mr. Brent), and in a lesser degree in other feather-footed pigeons.|$|R
5000|$|Plectrohyla cyanomma is a large, robust frog. Adult males measure 52 - 56 mm {{and females}} 52 - 65 mm in snout-vent length. The {{tympanum}} is partly or completely concealed. The fingers have vestigial webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum is uniform olive-green with few tiny, bright yellow spots; the olive-green fades to pale blue around vent and along {{outer edge of}} forearm and tarsus. The venter and chin are greenish-yellow, as are the <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> and fingers. The ventral surfaces of limbs to the inner toes and fingers bright are yellow-orange.

50|$|This is an {{autosomal}} {{trait that}} gives a very extreme diplopod phenotype, with up to eight toes on a foot. In some embryos, the two <b>outer</b> front <b>toes</b> on each foot are joined together. The trait is now extinct and was never fully characterized.|$|R
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|R
500|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{are generally}} medium to large parrots of stocky build, {{which range from}} [...] in length and [...] in weight; however, one species, the cockatiel, is considerably smaller and slimmer than the other species, being [...] long (including its long pointed tail feathers) and [...] in weight. The movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, is spectacular in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused. Cockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two middle toes forward and the two <b>outer</b> <b>toes</b> backward. They differ {{in the presence of}} an erectile crest and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.|$|R
