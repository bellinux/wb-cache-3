5|$|Heins {{discusses}} the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> action for minority students in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld {{affirmative action in}} the admission of minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he {{was rejected by the}} school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process.|$|E

However, the emphasis on improving the lot of the Malays greatly worried the non-Malays, and when the Third Malaysia Plan was launched, the government toned down its rhetoric <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> action and emphasised greater economic growth, which would benefit all.|$|E

By August 1972, only 534 minority workers had received training and only 34 had received union cards under the New York Plan. In 1973, John Lindsay, who had become a Democrat, withdrew from the New York Plan, setting a new objective to increase minority representation in the building trades to twenty five per cent.|$|E

500|$|Richardson and {{the school}} had differing views <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> action; she {{supported}} the concept, opposing the administration's hiring strategy for minority candidates. Heins provides background, including management's failure to hire several key candidates. One was Beverly Harrison, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York who {{was supported by the}} majority of the school's professors. Boston University President John Silber and nine other faculty members interviewed Harrison for two hours, criticizing her support for feminism. School of Theology dean Richard Nesmith told the school's professors that Harrison's replies to questions from the ten faculty members in her interview were inadequate and she did not [...] "cut the mustard".|$|E

500|$|Although current PRC {{minority}} policy, {{which is}} based <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> actions, has reinforced a Uyghur ethnic identity that is distinct from the Han population, some scholars argue that Beijing unofficially favours a monolingual, monocultural model {{that is based on}} the majority. The authorities also crack down on any activity that appears to constitute separatism. These policies, in addition to long-standing cultural differences, have sometimes resulted in [...] "resentments" [...] between Uyghur and Han citizens. On one hand, as a result of Han immigration and government policies, Uyghurs' freedoms of religion and of movement are curtailed, while most Uyghurs argue that the government downplays their history and traditional culture. On the other hand, some Han citizens view Uyghurs as benefiting from special treatment, such as preferential admission to universities and exemption from the one-child policy, and as [...] "harbouring separatist aspirations".|$|E
500|$|Perot campaigned in California in mid-June, {{and held}} a rally {{attended}} by 7,000 in Sacramento where he was heckled by some who chanted [...] "Talk about the issues!" [...] He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the L.A. race riots; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not take a stand <b>on</b> <b>affirmative</b> action. Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At {{the end of the}} month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of [...] "well dressed, middle aged" [...] individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America [...] "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.|$|E
