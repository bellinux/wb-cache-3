25|$|The U.S. Marine Corps {{was very}} {{interested}} in the AH-1G Cobra, but it preferred a twin-engine version for improved safety in over-water operations, and also wanted a more potent turret-mounted weapon. At first, the Department of Defense had balked at providing the Marines with a twin-engine version of the Cobra, in the belief that commonality with Army AH-1Gs outweighed the advantages of a different engine fit. However, the Marines won out and awarded Bell a contract for 49 twin-engine AH-1J SeaCobras in May 1968. As an interim measure, the U.S. Army passed on 38 AH-1Gs to the Marines in 1969. The AH-1J also received a more powerful gun turret. It featured a three barrel 20mm XM197 cannon that was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> barrel M61 Vulcan cannon.|$|E

25|$|Ken Barrington made 20 Test centuries, three {{short of}} the England record held by Alastair Cook. He made {{hundreds}} against all the Test teams of his era, but {{less than a third}} in England, which partially accounts for his greater reputation abroad than at home. Barrington's granite-like hundreds ensured that England only lost one Test in which he made three figures, but also won eight, belying his reputation as a match-saver rather than a match-winner, and most of them by huge margins; four by an innings, one by 256 runs and three by 10, 9, and 8 wickets. Barrington twice made centuries in four successive Tests, against Pakistan and Indian in 1961–62 and Pakistan and the West Indies in 1967–68 and he was the first England batsmen to make a hundred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> Test cricket grounds with one each at Old Trafford, Edgbaston, Headingley, Lord's, Trent Bridge and the Oval.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009 it was {{reported}} that the Palestinian Authority had been urging Saudi Arabia through back channels to pressure Alstom and Veolia to abandon the project in return for the multi-billion dollar Haramain High Speed Rail Project and the $25 billion Gulf Railway project. The contract for the Haramain project was eventually awarded to a rival bidder. In November 2009, under the banner of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), Palestinian organizations launched a campaign <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> Gulf Cooperation Council states to withhold lucrative contracts for the Gulf railway project from the two companies unless they comply with demands to withdraw from the Jerusalem project. Veolia decided to sell its interests in the light railway, first to Dan Bus Company in 2009, and later to Egged, as part of a strategy to exit the transportation market. Veolia's interest in the Jerusalem Light Rail, together with its other transport business, was injected in 2011 in new subsidiary Veolia Transdev, jointly owned by Veolia and French financial institution Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations. After poor financial results, Veolia announced in December 2011 that it intended to exit the transport sector altogether and sell its stake in Veolia Transdev.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Murphy {{returned}} to Yale {{where he served}} as coach and trainer of the track team and trainer of the football team. Over the next 11 years, Murphy moved back-and-forth between Yale (1892–1896, 1901–1905) and the University of Pennsylvania (1896–1901, 1905–1913). After turning Yale into the dominant power in track and field, Murphy brought immediate success to Penn when he moved there in 1896. In his first season at Penn, the school captured the intercollegiate track championship, scoring 34 points to defeat Yale, and finished with 24.5 points. Of the 21 indoor and outdoor track teams coached by Murphy during this time, 15 of them won the intercollegiate championships—eight at Penn and seven at Yale. And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> occasions when his teams did not finish first, they finished second on four occasions and third and fourth once each. Wherever Murphy went as a coach he {{put in place a}} solid back-up team of assistant coaches and rubbers. Over the years these included George Orton, Mike Dee and Jimmy Curran. Many went on to achieve great success coaching college and high school athletics.|$|E
