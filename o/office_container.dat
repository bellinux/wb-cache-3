As a result, {{a wide range of}} solar thermal collectors and systems are produced by numerous manufacturers all over the world. In order to assess thermal performance, manufacturing quality, safety of operation and to identify potential for further improvement, accurate testing of solar thermal collectors and thermal solar systems is required. Standardized testing procedures for solar thermal collectors are e. g. specified in the European Standard EN 12975 or the international standard ISO 9806 and for solar thermal systems in the South African Standards SANS 1370 (Mechanical tests) and SANS 6211 - 1 (Thermal tests) {{as well as in the}} international standards ISO 9459 - 2 (CSTG-method) and ISO 9495 - 5 (DST-method). In order to secure a growing market for solar thermal products in South Africa and its neighbouring countries, it is essential to establish a solar thermal test institute as a service provider for manufactures and suppliers in the Southern African area. For this purpose, a turn-key test facility for solar thermal collectors and systems was purchased from the German company Solarund Wärmetechnik Stuttgart (SWT). SWT is a spin-off company from the Institute for Thermodynamics and Thermal Engineering (ITW) of the University of Stuttgart. ITW has been working in the solar thermal field for more than 30 years and is operating the “Research and Test Centre for Thermal Solar Systems” (TSZ). The TZS is the largest solar test centre in Europe. Hence, very substantial experience related to testing and the construction of test facilities has been gained at ITW and SWT. The test facility for the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) is part of a project financed by the Central Energy Fund (CEF) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The facility was manufactured and instrumented by SWT based on a standard <b>office</b> <b>container</b> as a turn-key product. Before the test facility arrived from Germany, two staff members of SABS were trained for one week at SWT in Stuttgart, Germany. An additional training program took place onsite, after the test facility had been set-up and commissioned in Pretoria. The initial operation was performed together with an expert from SWT. After shipment to South Africa the test facility could be taken into operation within a few days at the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS), located in Pretoria. The South African Bureau of Standards has been working with the mobile, standalone test facility since the beginning of 2007 and has already tested several systems according to SANS 6211 - 1. To-date, the experiences gained with the mobile, stand-alone test facility are very good. It operates without notable problems and delivers reliable and accurate results. The paper describes the principle set-up of the test facility as well as the experience gained by SABS. vk 201...|$|E

The Regulus cruise missile was launched {{with a pair of}} Aerojet-General 3KS-33,000 sec duration, 33000 lbf kN solid-propellant boosters. A turbojet engine sustained the long-range cruise flight after the boosters were dropped. Twenty-two minutes after launch, the missile struck its target.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2012, port {{activity}} at Malé consisted of portage of goods from anchored ships and manual unloading and warehousing. The Maldivian National Trading Corporation (MNTC), which {{was formed in}} the 1950s, and Orchid Company, which was formed a few years later, began using mechanized equipment at the port, including barges, tugboats and cranes. Port operations were assumed by the government after the two companies were dissolved, and in 1983, Maldives Transport and Contracting Company was formed as a state corporation owned {{by the state and}} the public. 1985 saw the Male' Commercial Harbour Project, which rebuilt and modernized the port, dredging and reshaping the harbor and constructing new jetties, <b>office</b> buildings and <b>container</b> terminals. The current port operator and authority, Maldives Ports Limited, was formed shortly after in 1986.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International <b>Container</b> <b>Office</b> BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of its}} {{response}} to the Report of the Public Inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary the Department of Health established the National Knowledge Service in 2003, tasking it with closer integration of digital and physical library services. A programme to establish a National Library for Health was established, which included a review from TFPL, a cost analysis by Robert Huggins Associates, and steps towards several NHS wide shared services, including: a business case for a unified NHS document delivery service developed by Bertha Man Low and colleagues; a question answering service; an NHS resolver and underlying enterprise architecture. With {{the demise of the}} NHSIA in 2005 the NeLH transferred its staff and operations to Connecting for Health, the body responsible for implementing the NHS National Programme for IT. The operational base remained in Birmingham but increasingly staff worked in the CFH main office in Leeds and also in London, first in Victoria and later at the CFH office in BMA House and a Department of Health <b>office</b> in Sea <b>Containers</b> House overlooking the River Thames. In 2008, with the National Programme for IT in decline, arrangements began to transfer the NeLH to NICE, where it continues to operate, as NHS Evidence.|$|R
40|$|The project {{reported}} here provides microbial characterization {{support to the}} Waste Management Systems (WMS) element of NASA's Life Support and Habitation Systems (LSHS) program. Conventional microbiological methods were used to detect and enumerate microorganisms in STS Volume F Compartment trash for three shuttle missions: STS 133, 134, and 135. This trash was usually made available within 2 days of landing at KSC. The Volume F bag was weighed, opened and the contents were cataloged and placed into categories: personal hygiene items - inclUding EVA maximum absorbent garments (MAGs) and Elbow packs (daily toilet wipes, etc), drink containers, food waste (and <b>containers),</b> <b>office</b> waste (paper), and packaging materials - plastic film and duct tape. The average wet trash generation rate for the three STS missions was 0. 362 % 0. 157 kgwet crew 1 d- 1. This was considerably lower and more variable than the average rate for 4 STS missions reported for FY 10. Trash subtotals by category: personal hygiene wastes, 56 %; drink items, 11 %; food wastes, 18 %; office waste, 3 %; and plastic film, 12 %. These wastes have an abundance of easily biodegraded compounds that can support the growth of microorganisms. Microbial characterization of trash showed {{that large numbers of}} bacteria and fungi have taken advantage of this readily available nutrient source to proliferate. Exterior and interior surfaces of plastic film bags containing trash were sampled and counts of cultivatable microbes were generally low and mostly occurred on trash bundles within the exterior trash bags. Personal hygiene wastes, drink containers, and food wastes and packaging all contained high levels of, mostly, aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and lower levels of yeasts and molds. Isolates from plate count media were obtained and identified. and were mostly aerobic heterotrophs with some facultative anaerobes. These are usually considered common environmental isolates on Earth. However, several pathogens were also isolated: Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli...|$|R
