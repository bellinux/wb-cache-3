5|$|Apart {{from one}} guest {{appearance}} for Barbados {{in a friendly}} match early in 1939, Constantine did not play first-class cricket after 1935 until the West Indies toured England in 1939. Constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939, to be available for the tour. However, he was unhappy with the playing strength of the touring team and the £600 he was offered in wages. He believed that the captain, Rolph Grant (younger brother <b>of</b> <b>Jackie),</b> was unqualified for the job and had been appointed only because he was white. Constantine captained the side in one match, but was reprimanded by the West Indies board for not pursuing a win. The West Indies lost the three-match Test series 1–0 against a very strong England side, although critics judged the overall playing record of the team to be good. In the three Tests, Constantine scored 110 runs at 27.50 and took 11 wickets at 29.81, including five for 75 in the final Test.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Robinson's {{major league}} debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{returned}} to York as a commercial, academy {{and community development}} consultant in April 2014, having previously intended {{to pursue a career}} in coaching. He took on the position of Head of Football Operations, before being appointed as first-team coach to manager Russ Wilcox in March 2015. In May 2015, Cresswell resumed his role as Head of Football Operations, while continuing to coach the first team. He took over as caretaker manager on 26 October 2015 after Wilcox's sacking, and was assisted by youth team coach Jonathan Greening and goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning. He was in charge for the 1–0 away defeat to Crawley Town on 31 October 2015, before ceasing his caretaker duties upon the appointment <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> McNamara as manager on 4 November. Cresswell left York by mutual consent on 16 December 2015.|$|E

5|$|He scored 22 {{goals in}} his 23 England {{appearances}} over a ten-year international career from 1938 to 1948, including four against Portugal in May 1947. He helped England to win two British Home Championship titles outright (1946–47 and 1947–48), {{and to share}} the Championship in 1938–39. He fell out of international contention {{at the age of}} 28 due to his contempt for manager Walter Winterbottom, his decision {{to drop out of the}} First Division, and the emergence <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Milburn and Nat Lofthouse. As well as his England caps, he also represented The Football League XI and played in a special Great Britain game against Europe in 1947. He married twice, and had two children and one step-child. His ashes are held in the National Football Museum, and he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Rivera is {{regarded}} within baseball {{as one of}} the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25games in 15consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21ERA and 1.00WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth pitching motion, and for his composure and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Robinson. Rivera has been involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered to be a strong candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, Eat Your Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing in}} two trial matches, Headley was {{selected}} to tour England in 1933 under the continuing captaincy <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Grant. The English press speculated on Headley's {{ability to cope with}} English conditions, while expecting him to perform to a high standard. In the event, Wisden believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation. In the first match of the tour he scored 52 {{out of a total of}} 129 against Northamptonshire, in difficult batting conditions on a wet pitch. He scored fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at Lord's Cricket Ground. In the second innings of this match, a short ball from Bill Bowes struck Headley on the chest, and as a result of this injury he missed three games, but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against Glamorgan and 224 not out against Somerset. A quieter match followed against Middlesex, but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against Derbyshire, which took him past 1,000 runs for the season. Despite Headley's contributions, the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings. Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings, and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies followed-on. Critics were impressed by Headley's second innings performance, in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting. Between the first and second Tests, in matches where conditions were difficult for batting and ideal for spin bowlers, Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side's highest score in each of four innings.|$|E
5|$|Headley was {{selected}} for the West Indian tour of Australia in the 1930–31 season, under the captaincy <b>of</b> <b>Jackie</b> Grant. After a brief visit to New Zealand where they played a non-first-class match against Wellington, the tourists arrived in Sydney. Headley made a good start to the tour and attracted praise from the press in Australia and West Indies. The first match of the Australian leg was against New South Wales, where the West Indians were bowled out for 188 and Headley was stumped for 25. However, his runs came {{in less than two}} overs and Learie Constantine later rated this as one of Headley's best innings. In the second innings, Headley made 82, the top score, but could not prevent the tourists losing. The next match was also lost, as Bert Ironmonger took thirteen wickets in the match for Victoria. In the first innings, Headley scored 131 out of 212, regarded by one critic {{as one of the best}} centuries scored on the ground, and top-scored again with 34 in the second innings. By this stage the Australian bowlers had realised that Headley excelled when hitting the ball through the off side, and they began to alter their tactics accordingly. In the final match before the Test series began, against South Australia, Headley had problems playing the Australian bowlers, particularly the leg spin of Clarrie Grimmett. The Australians bowled at Headley's leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side, making it difficult for him to score runs. Headley scored 27 and 16 as his team were heavily defeated. These bowling tactics were used in subsequent matches, and Headley found difficulty in countering them.|$|E
