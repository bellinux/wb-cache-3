25|$|In general, professionals, {{civil rights}} leaders, and humanitarians saw {{the shift from}} {{institutional}} confinement to local care as the appropriate approach. The deinstitutionalization movement started off slowly but gained momentum as it adopted philosophies from the Civil Rights Movement. During the 1960s, deinstitutionalization increased dramatically, and {{the average length of}} stay within mental institutions decreased by more than half. Many patients began to be placed in community care facilities instead <b>of</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> institutions.|$|E
25|$|The International Council Of Nursing (ICN), {{the largest}} {{international}} health professional {{organization in the}} world, recognizes the shortage of nurses as a growing crisis in the world. This shortage impacts the healthcare of everyone worldwide. One of the many reasons is that nurses who pursue to become nurses do so very late in their lives. This leads to a non-lengthy employment time. A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes {{is expected to grow}} rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind <b>of</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> available at a nursing home. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.|$|E
500|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{over the future}} of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it, particularly around Bounds Green. Around 1972, approximately 400 homes on the road were compulsory purchased by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled. The properties have suffered from a lack <b>of</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>care.</b> [...] Since TfL took responsibility for the road, land for future schemes has been left dormant, resulting in urban decay with derelict properties. Compulsory purchased properties were let out to various short-term tenants, which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor. Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road, particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital. Areas close to the road, such as the alleys behind properties on the Telford Road section, have suffered from fly tipping and anti-social behaviour.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{question}} about the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> and it's definition within the health and social care systems as well as it analyzes factors which cause a rise of the demand and spendings on the long- term care. Based on the recommendations which should help to maintain the increase of the public spendings on the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> in the limits, it is found out that the principles of the Czech organizing <b>of</b> the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> do not meet these recommendations. Moreover, because of an unclear setting of the rules <b>of</b> providing the <b>long-term</b> <b>care,</b> higher costs for the public budget are already generated in the Czech Republic. It is found out, that the higher costs are generated mainly because the rational clients <b>of</b> the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> have space for shifting their costs to the public sector. Regarding the unsystematic definition <b>of</b> the <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> as a clearly defined individual system, the thesis deals with the empirical findings of the total undistored costs <b>of</b> the formal <b>long-term</b> <b>care</b> in the Czech republic as well as tries to compute ‚the costs of inefficiency'.
