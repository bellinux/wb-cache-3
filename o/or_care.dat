5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the summer. The High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes.

5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy <b>or</b> <b>care.</b> Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical <b>or</b> <b>care</b> establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E

25|$|The {{high level}} of {{employees}} in teaching is possibly due to the town's proximity to Canterbury, which has three higher education establishments. The elderly population of the town has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes and at the Whitstable and Tankerton Hospital. At the 2001 census, 1.3% of the town's population resided in a medical <b>or</b> <b>care</b> establishment, compared to {{the national average of}} only 0.8%.|$|E

25|$|MG Walt formalized {{the program}} in February 1967, {{appointing}} LtCol William R. Corson as the III MAF deputy director for Combined Action. Corson believed CAP should have a separate chain of command, as it was his opinion that the average battalion commander in Vietnam often didn’t know <b>or</b> <b>care</b> how to succeed in combined action, since they were trained and oriented toward offensive large-unit warfare. Corson saw CAP as being mobile and offensive in nature, a concept which later took shape in the mobile CAP units. However, Corson eventually became disenchanted with {{the conduct of the}} war.|$|E

On the night of 13–14 September, the company was surrounded by the NVA in their position. Rose dug trenches for the wounded and treated their injuries, as the enemy spent the night bombarding the company with rockets, grenades, and mortars. Moving from position to position, he exposed himself to NVA fire, encouraging the soldiers and treating the wounded.|$|E

Kyo initially believes that his father murdered his mother after they engaged in a heated argument, but this turns out to be false, and Yoh actually feels guilty for his wife's death because he feels it was his fault. Despite this, neither Kyo or Sho have any sympathy for their father. He is determined to have one of his sons marry Misao and father an heir for the clan. He is very fond of Misao, whom he remembers from her childhood.|$|E
25|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are hotels and guest houses on and near the seafront to {{accommodate}} the influx of all-year-round visitors. Although the number of hotels {{in recent years has}} declined because of the high land redevelopment values, this has resulted in an improvement in quality of the existing premises. The High Street has a wide variety of independent shops and services and there are several factories, mainly situated on the small industrial estates on the town's borders. The above-average population age has led to many health- and social-care jobs at local care homes. At the 2001 UK census, 1.8% of the population resided in a medical <b>or</b> <b>care</b> establishment, which is more than double the national average of only 0.8%. Many jobs in education are provided by the town's relatively high number of schools and colleges.|$|E
25|$|The second care structure, {{termed the}} Anglo-American model, {{utilizes}} pre-hospital allied health staff, such as emergency medical technicians and paramedics, to staff ambulances, {{which may be}} classified according to the varying skill levels of the crews. In this model it is rare to find a physician actually working routinely in the pre-hospital setting, although they may be utilised on complex or major injuries or illnesses. In this system, a physicians involvement {{is most likely to}} be the provision of medical oversight for the work of the ambulance crews, which may be accomplished in terms of off-line medical control, with protocols or 'standing orders' for certain types of medical procedures <b>or</b> <b>care,</b> or on-line medical control, in which the technician must establish contact with the physician, usually at the hospital, and receive direct orders for various types of medical interventions. In some cases, such as in the UK, South Africa and Australia, a paramedic may be an autonomous health care professional, and does not require the permission of a physician to administer interventions or medications from an agreed list, and can perform roles such as suturing or prescribing medication to the patient.|$|E
