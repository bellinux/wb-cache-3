2500|$|TUESDAY.—"Letter from {{solicitor}} informing me that I {{have come}} into £1,000,000 through the will of an Australian gold-digger named Tomkins. On referring to my diary I find that I saved his life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine. This is very gratifying. Was late at the office as I had to look in at the Palace on the way, {{in order to get}} knighted, but managed to get a good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with a razor, who demanded £100. Shot him after a desperate struggle. Tea at an ABC, where I met the Duke of —-. Fell into the Thames <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home,</b> but swam ashore without difficulty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Declarations {{of present}} state of mind: Much like a present-sense {{impression}} describes the outside world, declarant's statement {{to the effect of}} [...] "I am angry!" [...] or [...] "I am Napoleon!" [...] will be admissible to prove that the declarant was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant's mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements are also used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the declarant, like his saying, [...] "I'm gonna go buy some groceries and get the oil changed in my car <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> from work." [...] Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. Any statements contained therein that attribute fault or causation to an individual will generally not be admissible under this exception.|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

2500|$|In France, Bunin found himself, for {{the first}} time, {{at the center of}} public attention. On 10 November 1933, the Paris {{newspapers}} came out with huge headlines: [...] "Bunin— the Nobel Prize laureate" [...] giving the whole of the Russian community in France cause for celebration. [...] "You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like we were at the bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize! And not for some political scribblings, but for real prose! After having been asked to write a first page column for the Paris Revival newspaper, I stepped {{out in the middle of}} the night onto the Place d'Italie and toured the local bistros <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home,</b> drinking in each and every one of them to the health of Ivan Bunin!" [...] fellow Russian writer Boris Zaitsev wrote. Back in the USSR the reaction was negative: Bunin's triumph was explained there as [...] "an imperialist intrigue." ...|$|E

60|$|This meeting {{came about}} in a {{literary}} way. Some months earlier, in May, to be exact, Hurd of the Transcript had placed in my hands a novel called Zury and my review of it had drawn from its author, a western man, a letter of thanks and a cordial invitation to visit him as I passed through Chicago, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to <b>my</b> old <b>home.</b> This I had gladly accepted, and now with keen interest, I was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to his <b>home.</b>|$|R

By the end of the decade, she had mostly retired to her home on Grimes Creek outside of Boise, maintaining an interest and presence in regional cultural events. Sorrels died on June 11, 2017 at a daughter's home in Reno, Nevada. The Idaho Statesman closes its announcement of Sorrel's passing with her own lyrics from My Last Go Round, a 2004 album.When my wandering soul shall rest, and my last song gets sung, I’ll find the brightest and the best; <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>home,</b> all <b>my</b> long lost friends and lovers, once again they will be found; And I’ll kiss all their shining faces <b>on</b> <b>my</b> last go round.|$|R

40|$|At the International Association for Court Administration (IACA) Conference in 2008 in Dublin Barry Mahoney, President Emeritus, Justice Management Institute did an {{excellent}} job at presenting some of the major sources of delay in case processing. He identified both case-specific and systemic factors. He also identified the goals of case flow management. I was impressed by the thoroughness and succinctness of what he was presenting. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>home</b> I thought about how I might present the same information to my judges and court staff and how the information might be used to make positive changes in one of my courts. The following is a description of what took place at our one-day workshop on felony case management, and the positive results we obtained in working with judges, court staff and our justice partners. The process described below identified specific barriers to case processing and resulted in the development of workable solutions to case delay. </span...|$|R
50|$|Oceanlane are a Japanese {{rock band}} from Tokyo. The band formed in 2001 by two {{longtime}} friends, Hajime Takei and Kay Naoe, who began playing shows with hired drums and bass {{players in the}} Tokyo area in 2002. They self-released a 2003 demo EP, and signed to Howling Bull Entertainment/Handicraft Recordings, who released their debut LP, <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>home.</b> This album reached #1 on Japan's independent music charts. A follow-up LP, Kiss&Kill, which was produced by Pelle Gunnerfeldt, followed in 2005. In the interim, the band toured nationally in Japan and supported many Western acts on the Japan legs of their tours, including Jimmy Eat World, All-American Rejects, The Stills, and Copeland. They also appeared on the winter leg of the Vans Warped Tour 2004. Since 2004, bassist Takeshi Horikoshi (henrytennis, former bungee jump festival) and drummer Masashi “Marcy” Shimada (buddhistson, kamomekamome) have recorded and toured with OCEANLANE and have become more or less {{permanent members of the}} band.|$|R
