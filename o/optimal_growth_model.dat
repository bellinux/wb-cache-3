[...] The celebrated Cass criterion for optimal time paths in the one good growth model quickly followed. [...] The essence of this work is the search for price characterizations of efficiency for dynamic time paths, an effort that directly pointed {{the way to the}} subsequent full dynamic decentralization of the neoclassical <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>model,</b> a fact that permits its use for modeling a wide range of business cycle and other macroeconomic phenomena.

40|$|PublisherTokyoAs Prof. Okishio {{proved the}} {{existence}} of exploitation mathematically, the birth, growth, and death of capitalism should also be proved mathematically,and for this purpose we formulated the so-called Marxian <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>model.</b> This is not a model in value-term because peoples' direct interest is not value itself but utility and firms' interest is not value but profit. However, a very important finding {{of this paper is}} that such a non-value-term model can be translated into a value-term model, and we introduce a value-term reproduction scheme from the Marxian <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>model.</b> In this form, we confirm that our model fulfills the conditions of simple reproduction and extended reproduction. However, a more important fact we found is that this optimal path shows (1) rising organic composition of capital, (2) falling rate of profit, and (3) falling ratio of the output of the first sector. The second fact contradicts the Okishio Theorem, and the third contradicts the Lenin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{address in}} this paper the {{question}} of the existence of a Social Welfare Function that would be sustainable and would allow us to obtain solutions to <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>models.</b> We define sustainability by two new axioms called Never-decisiveness of the present and Never-decisiveness of the future. We first show that a SWF which has Never-decisiveness properties cannot be defined on a ball of l+∞. We must (i) restrict to the set of utility streams for which the value of the SWF is finite and (ii) introduce additional assumptions in order to obtain the Never-decisiveness properties. Our main result {{in this paper}} is therefore to show that the undiscounted utilitarian criterion is an anonymous and never-decisive criterion for <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>models.</b> We consider the set of utilities of consumptions which are generated by a specific technology, namely a technology with decreasing returns for high levels of capital, and restrict ourselves to good programs, i. e., any program for which intertemporal utility is well defined...|$|R

40|$|In an <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>model</b> with a time-to-build delay, the {{feasibility}} condition is a delayed-differential equation, and the Euler-type condition is an advanced-differential equation.

40|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} for defining social welfare relations for an economy with infinite horizon. The first one is to consider the set of intertemporal utility streams generated by a general set of bounded consumptions and define a preference relation between them. This relation is ideally required to satisfy two main axioms, the Pareto axiom, which guarantees efficiency and the Anonymity axiom, which guarantees equity. Basu and Mitra (2003) show {{that it is impossible}} to represent by a function a preference relation embodying both requirements, and Basu and Mitra (2007) propose and characterize a new welfare criterion called utilitarian social welfare relation. In the same framework, Chichilnisky (1996) proposes two axioms that capture the idea of sustainable growth : non-dictatorship of the present and non-dictatorship of the future, and exhibits a mixed criterion, adding a discounted utilitarian part, which gives a dictatorial role to the present, and a long term part, which gives a dictatorial role to the future. The drawback of Chichilnisky's approach is that it often does not allow to explicity characterize <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> paths with <b>optimal</b> control techniques. Our aim is less general than Chichilnisky's and Basu and Mitra's : we want to have a non-dictatorial criterion for <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>models.</b> We restrict ourselves to the set of utilities of consumptions which are generated by a specific technology. We show that the undiscounted utilitarian criterion pioneered by Ramsey (1928) is not only convenient if one wants to solve an <b>optimal</b> <b>growth</b> problem but also sustainable, efficient and equitable.
