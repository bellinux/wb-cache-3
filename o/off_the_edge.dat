5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. It was believed that she had sunk <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy {{did not have the}} capability to search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong 64 {{features}} a separate multiplayer mode with six minigames {{for two to}} four players. Monkey Smash is an open arena, deathmatch-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all of their own lives. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a platform. Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.|$|E
5|$|In August 1988, {{production}} {{moved to}} the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key {{was used for the}} sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez, following his arrest, is driven <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> Other locations there included Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour. As production moved back to Mexico, Broccoli became ill, leading to Michael G. Wilson becoming co-producer, a position he subsequently retained.|$|E

The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel {{is one of the}} Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E

5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|John Glen {{returned}} {{once again}} to direct, teaming up once more with production designer Peter Lamont. Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988. Shooting began in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus. Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún. In August 1988 production moved to the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key {{was used for the}} sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez following his arrest is driven <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge.</b> Other locations there included the Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio.

5|$|The final boss fight {{takes place}} at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the temple. Peace is {{restored}} to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.|$|E

5|$|The semi-final {{round of}} the tournament took place {{immediately}} after the first round, and Mr. Perfect gained the early advantage over Bret Hart. Hart reversed {{the momentum of the}} match by applying a series of headlocks on Perfect. Perfect then performed a dropkick on Hart and followed it up by pushing him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the ring into the steel barricade on the arena floor. Perfect then performed another dropkick, but Hart recovered and executed a superplex on Perfect. Hart wore down Perfect's leg with a figure four leglock and attempted to perform the Sharpshooter, his finishing maneuver. Perfect blocked the move and attempted to perform the Perfectplex, his finishing move, on Hart. Hart reversed this move, however, and both men were thrown out of the ring. When they returned to the ring, Perfect tried to pin Hart with a small package. Hart reversed the move to get the pinfall victory and advance to the tournament final.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with one corner <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of the}} cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E

5|$|The team is {{inserted}} into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will {{play a critical role}} in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban soldiers, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.|$|E
