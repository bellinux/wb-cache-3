500|$|It premiered on BET on February 17, 1986. In the video, Jackson {{goes to a}} diner {{with her}} friends {{to talk about her}} {{relationship}} problems. Her boyfriend (played by Rudy Huston) shows up with his friends, and Jackson decides to share her feelings about their relationship. In the video, Jackson's reality is a dark world with faded colors. In a more dreamscape world, the colors are vibrant and everything is 2D. The video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R/Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987. While reviewing the video, Vanity Fair magazine said in 1986 that Jackson [...] "might be Michael's androgynous twin in the sweep <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> the accusatory glare in her eyes, the collapsing diagonals of her dancing".|$|E
500|$|By 1925, Tschaikovsky had {{developed}} a tuberculous infection <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> and she {{was placed in a}} succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight. She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia's tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as [...] "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.|$|E

Living beyond the mostly white, middle class scope of these groups was an active community of cross-dressers, hustlers, and [...] "street queens" [...] who worked primarily in the Tenderloin district of the city. After being denied service at Gene Compton's Cafeteria, a few activists picketed the restaurant in 1966. A few days later, early in the morning, the police arrived to arrest patrons in drag. [...] A riot ensued when a drag queen threw {{the contents of a}} cup of coffee in the face of a police officer in response to the officer's grabbing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> The cafe's plate glass windows were shattered in the mel√©e, and then again a few days later after they had been replaced. Although three years later the Stonewall Riots would have a more significant impact, the Compton's Cafeteria riots were among the first in American history where homosexuals and the newly forming transgender community fought against the authorities.|$|E
