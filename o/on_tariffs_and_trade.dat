5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade,</b> believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. When the General Agreement <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade's</b> (GATT) Uruguay Round trade {{negotiations}} were indefinitely suspended on December 7, 1990, most analysts {{agreed that the}} proximate cause of the collapse was the European Community's intransigence in the agricultural negotiations. The EC's uncompromising stance {{in the area of}} farm trade puzzled many observers, especially those inclined to see things in terms of a straightforward rational costbenefit analysis. For these critics, explanation of such behavior must rest with national governments who lacked the political will to confront powerful domestic farm lobbies. The resulting paralysis led to the irrational result that farming, a sector which provides only 3 % of Community GNP, had been preserved by sacrificing potential agreements in other sectors, including trade in services, which contribute more than 70 % of Community GNP...|$|R

40|$|The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) {{a system}} of {{differential}} <b>and</b> favorable <b>trade</b> arrangements toward less developed countries, adopted by the General Agreement <b>on</b> <b>Tariff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Trade</b> (GATT) {{has been around since}} the early 1970 s. A primary objective of these schemes has been to promote industrialization and economic growth in less developed countries through trade rather than aid. The outcome of such programs has, however, been mixed. This paper identifies some of the underlying political and economic dynamics which led to the dismal performance of the GSP schemes of the United States in respect to the industrialization and economic growth of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The paper suggests that the effectiveness of GSP schemes could be significantly improved if they were brought under the binding WTO rules, if greater resources were directed to removing supply constraints in the LDCs, and if developed countries granted unwavering market access to LDC exports. ...|$|R
