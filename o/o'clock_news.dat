5|$|Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis {{developed}} {{the idea for}} the sitcom while working on Not the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News.</b> Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed Fawlty Towers, they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom. An unaired pilot episode was made in 1982, and a six-episode series was commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the second}} series was delayed several times. While Adams {{was meant to be}} working on scripts for a stage {{adaptation}} of Hitchhiker's in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for Doctor Who and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for Not the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News.</b> The recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.|$|E
5|$|For Season 17, John Lloyd, a {{frequent}} collaborator with script editor Douglas Adams, adapted material from his unpublished science fiction story GiGax and in October 1978 submitted Shylock, a four-part serial written in Adams' light-hearted style. After providing a second {{draft of the}} storyline to modify parts of the script to avoid {{issues such as the}} rules involving child actors, Lloyd was forced to focus on his commitments as producer of Not the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News.</b> Williams was still interested enough in the storyline that he made plans to involved writer Allan Prior to work on the scripts. The storyline was commissioned on 7 February 1979 and a script list dated 29 June 1979 links Lloyd and Prior to the project. Lloyd officially agreed to another writer taking on his story on 25 August 1979. In the story, the Doctor is subpoenaed to appear in court when a corporation tries to buy Earth in order to obtain a matter-transmutation device.|$|E

She was scheduled to present the Six <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> {{on the evening of}} the following day. She was featured on the cover of that week's Radio Times magazine (for 24 to 30 April).|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{positions of}} {{editor of the}} One and Six <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the Ten <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News.</b> The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, {{as a way of}} pooling resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{retirement}} of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> led {{to changes in}} the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. At the time of the changes, a new set design featuring a projected background image of a fictional newsroom was introduced. New programme titles were introduced on 16 February 2004 to match those of BBC News 24.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "bear" [...] in this episode, the monstrously-altered Allen Leighton, {{was judged}} {{by some of}} ABC's local {{affiliate}} stations to be so frightening that they broadcast a black screen during the Thetan's appearances, effectively censoring most of the show's last act. In {{other parts of the}} United States, the Thetan footage was tape delayed until after the 11 <b>o'clock</b> evening <b>news.</b> In others, it was not shown at all. It should be noted that unlike today where film series are transferred to video tape for transmission, even until the mid-1980s film series were broadcast live from the film print via telecine.|$|R

50|$|The {{first episode}} was {{broadcast}} on 29 November 1970. Episodes are broadcast on ARD's main channel Das Erste on Sunday {{evening at the}} prime viewing time of 8.15 pm (just after the 8 <b>o'clock</b> Tagesschau <b>news)</b> around three times a month. Reruns are often shown by various regional ARD stations and on foreign broadcasters. Next to the member stations of the ARD, the National Austrian broadcasting corporation Österreichischer Rundfunk joined the production pool in 1971 and airs the program on its ORF 2 channel. Switzerland's Schweizer Fernsehen joined the pool from 1990 to 2001 and again in 2011 and distributes its episodes through its channel SRF 1.|$|R

25|$|Angela Rippon {{became the}} first female news {{presenter}} of the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976 singing and dancing.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of BBC News {{the previous}} year, regional headlines were included {{at the start}} of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular News at Ten programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned News at Ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's Ten <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News,</b> the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.|$|E

He was a broadcaster {{in the early days}} of 2LO at Savoy Hill, and in 1935 joined the BBC as a casting director and later became a news reader and announcer.In a famous incident on 15 October 1940, the BBC's Broadcasting House took a direct hit from a delayed-action German bomb, which eventually exploded during the nine <b>o'clock</b> radio <b>news</b> read by Belfrage. Seven people were killed, and Belfrage, covered with plaster and soot, carried on reading the news as if nothing had happened. Listeners at home heard just a dull thud.

25|$|Some {{newspapers}} were criticised for sensationalism and invasion of privacy, but the BBC was criticised by journalists for the opposite: the BBC's evening news programme on the day, the Nine <b>O'Clock</b> <b>News</b> carried {{the story about}} the crash as its third item.|$|E

5000|$|Stevenson {{began his}} {{broadcasting}} career in 1964 with the regional Dunedin station DNTV2, and in 1969 {{was chosen to}} read the first nationwide news bulletin for the new countrywide television network (on 5 November). He remained as the country's main newsreader on NZBC and its successor (TVNZ)'s early-evening news {{through much of the}} 1970s, also presenting the nine <b>o'clock</b> evening <b>news</b> digest Tonight at Nine. Since leaving a regular anchor role, he has appeared as presenter and narrator of many series, his distinctive voice making him a popular choice for documentary work. As Jane Bowron of The Dominion Post once opined [...] "His voice is authoritative. If there is an end-of-the-world broadcast kept in readiness for the final moments on Earth, I hope TVNZ has chosen Dougal to announce it." [...] His reputation within New Zealand broadcasting is also such that he has appeared as himself in cameos in two New Zealand films, Sleeping Dogs (1977) and In My Father's Den (2004). In 2012 he finally made his debut in a true acting role, starring as [...] "Grandad Jack" [...] in a six-minute short film by Gem Waterhouse, Forget Me Not.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of 2006, Johnson began {{anchoring}} the news for the first time. He took over the reins of KOMO 4 News at 5 <b>o'clock</b> from longtime <b>news</b> anchor Dan Lewis, when KOMO underwent a broadcast schedule change involving their evening newscast lineup. Lewis anchored the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news with Kathi Goertzen (2007-2008), and with Mary Nam (2008-2014). Johnson anchored the 5 p.m. news with Kathi Goertzen (2007-2008), and Mary Nam or Dan Lewis (2008-2012). Johnson currently anchors the 5 p.m. newscast with Molly Shen, and the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts with Mary Nam after his colleague Dan Lewis stepped away from the anchor desk after 27 years in May 2014.

50|$|Shortly after that, at 4:45 <b>o'clock,</b> Wyss {{received}} <b>news</b> {{that some}} troops were advancing from the southeast, but {{he explained that}} they were the imperial battalions from the 29th infantry regiment, for which he was waiting. He sent a patrol to meet them, who only then sent him the messages that these were Hungarian soldiers. Hearing this, Wyss took a platoon of the Uhlans and went towards the part of Csorna in the direction of Szilsárkány. The advance of the Hungarians was so quick that they started to fire on Csorna from three directions, long before the imperials installed their cannons. The surprised imperials responded well, installing their cannons and troops in a hurry, in the heavy attack and fire of the Hungarians. The attack occurred at 5 o'clock, according to Kmety and 5:30 or 6 o'clock, according to the Austrians, and although they were expecting this to happen, its extraordinary quickness took them by surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{a letter}} written by King James to the Prince of Orange, June 15, 1685, it appears, that though the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, on Thursday evening, June 11th, an account of his landing did not reach the King at Whitehall till Saturday morning the 13th. The House of Commons, having met on that day at the usual hour, between nine and ten <b>o'clock,</b> the <b>news</b> was soon {{afterwards}} communicated to them by a Message from the King, delivered by the Earl of Middleton (to whom Etheredge afterwards wrote two poetical Epistles from Ratisbon). Having voted and drawn up an Address to his Majesty, desiring him {{to take care of}} his royal person, they adjourned to four o'clock; in which interval they went to Whitehall, presented their Address, and then met again. Com. Jour. vol. ix. p. 735. About this time, therefore, it may be presumed, the news transpired, and in an hour afterwards probably reached the Theatre, where an audience was assembled at the representation of the opera of 'Albion and Albanius;' for pays at that time began at four o'clock. It seems from Mr. Luttrell's MS. note, that the first representation of this opera was on Saturday the 6th of June; and Downes (Roscius Ang. p. 40) says, that in consequence of Monmouth's invasion, it was only performed six times; so that the sixth representation was, without doubt, on Saturday, the 13th of June. An examination of dates is generally fatal to tales of this kind: here, however, they certainly support the tradition mentioned in the text."-- Life of Dryden, page 188.|$|R
