40|$|Introduction Ovine {{respiratory}} disease is frequently associated to high economic losses. It {{can be caused}} by several aetiological agents, difficulting the diagnosis and the implementation of effective therapeutic measures. The pathologist has a difficult, but very important role, in the diagnostic procedure, based on standard histomorphological classification of lung injury. Objectives The authors describe and submit for discussion a case of hyperacute pneumonia with high mortality, associated with abrupt climate changes. Medical History High mortality rate, affecting young lambs. At necropsy, dark and firm lungs, with hepatisation were observed, without other significant macroscopic lesions. Material and Methods Lung samples were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution and 3 μm thick sections were stained for routine histopathological diagnosis with Haematoxylin and Eosin. Results and discussion Macroscopic examination revealed acute congestion and haemorrhage, involving pleura. The severe pulmonary haemorrhage and congestion and the absence of cranioventral fibrinonecrotizing bronchopneumonia and fibrinous pleuritis, led to consider other causes namely pneumotoxicosis but no Pasteurella. Elongated cells with basophilic spindle-shaped nuclei, in alveoli were also seen. The <b>oat</b> <b>cells,</b> probably caused by leukotoxin from Mannheimia haemolytica, an opportunistic pathogen member of the normal bacterial flora of the nasopharynx and tonsils of ruminants, were crucial to the diagnosis of the present case of hyperacute pneumonia, despite the absence of fibrin. Conclusion The presence of characteristic <b>oat</b> <b>cells</b> contributed to the diagnosis of Mannheimia haemolytica, however microbiological tests are still needed to make a definitive diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Vasopressin-neurophysin (hNpI), oxytocin-neurophysin (hNpII) {{and blood}} {{osmolality}} were assayed before any treatment in basal conditions in 35 patients suffering from lung carcinoma (20 <b>oat</b> <b>cell,</b> 6 undifferentiated and 9 well-differentiated epidermoid cell carcinomas). Plasma vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) was also assayed in 7 of the 20 patients suffering from <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma. We found a close correlation (r = 0. 98) between plasma ADH and hNpI {{levels in the}} 7 patients. Further, hNpI was elevated in 13 out of the 20 <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma patients and in none of the epidermoid-cell carcinoma group; however, searching for an abnormality of ADH secretion as reflected by a detectable plasma hNpI level together with subnormal plasma osmolality revealed 2 additional positive results in the <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma group, and 2 out of the 6 in the undifferentiated-cell carcinoma group. hNpII was increased together {{with an increase in}} hNpI in 6 <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma patients; it was specifically increased without hNpI increment in 2 additional <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma patients and in 2 patients of the undifferentiated-cell carcinoma group (different from the 2 positive for the hNpI-osmolality ratio). hNpI and hNpII were normal in the majority of undifferentiated and all of the differentiated epidermoid-cell carcinoma group. Hence, our results show that simultaneous measurements of hNpI, hNpII, and blood osmolality could detect abnormalities in 17 out of 20 <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma patients, in 4 of the 9 undifferentiated-cell carcinoma patients, but in none of the differentiated epidermoid-cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that the neurophysin assay can be used for the early detection of oat cell- and possibly other neuroendocrine-derived carcinomas.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Small cell {{neuroendocrine cancer}} of the breast is a rare tumor with less than 30 cases {{reported}} in the literature. The morphological and immunohistochemical patterns of this tumor are similar to small cell neuroendocrine {{cancer of the}} lung. For this reason, {{it is often difficult}} to distinguish a primary small cell neuroendocrine cancer of the breast from a metastatic lesion from other sites. Case presentation We report and characterize with immunohistochemical techniques a case of primary small cell neuroendocrine cancer of the breast occurring in a 40 -year-old Caucasian woman. A palpable and mobile 3. 0 cm tumor was located in the upper-outer quadrant of her right breast. Lumpectomy and subsequent radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node resection were performed. Microscopically, the tumor consisted predominantly of a diffuse proliferation of small <b>oat</b> <b>cells.</b> The tumor cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin. One of 16 lymph nodes was metastatic. A correct treatment needs to be chosen. Conclusions It has recently been demonstrated that early small cell neuroendocrine cancer of the breast shows a good prognosis with adjuvant treatments with high disease free survival. Our patient is alive and well without disease eight years after treatment. We performed an adjuvant therapy with the classic scheme doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by carboplatin and etoposide. A more extensive review is required to define a standard treatment protocol for this rare neoplasm. </p...|$|R
40|$|Satellite RNAs usurp the {{replication}} {{machinery of}} their helper viruses, {{even though they}} bear little or no sequence similarity to the helper virus RNA. In Cereal yellow dwarf polerovirus serotype RPV (CYDV-RPV), the 322 -nucleotide satellite RNA (satRPV RNA) accumulates to high levels {{in the presence of}} the CYDV-RPV helper virus. Rolling circle replication generates multimeric satRPV RNAs that self-cleave via a double-hammerhead ribozyme structure. Alternative folding inhibits formation of a hammerhead in monomeric satRPV RNA. Here we determine helper virus requirements and the effects of mutations and deletions in satRPV RNA on its replication in <b>oat</b> <b>cells.</b> Using in vivo selection of a satRPV RNA pool randomized at specific bases, we found that disruption of the base pairing necessary to form the non-self-cleaving conformation reduced satRPV RNA accumulation. Unlike other satellite RNAs, both the plus and minus strands proved to be equally infectious. Accordingly, very similar essential replication structures were identified in each strand. A different region is required only for encapsidation. The CYDV-RPV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (open reading frames 1 and 2), when expressed from the nonhelper Barley yellow dwarf luteovirus, was capable of replicating satRPV RNA. Thus, the helper virus’s polymerase is the sole determinant of the ability of a virus to replicate a rolling circle satellite RNA. We present a framework for functional domains in satRPV RNA with three types of function: (i) conformational control elements comprising an RNA switch, (ii) self-functiona...|$|R

METHODS [...] Paraffin wax embedded tissues from 61 cases of primary lung carcinoma were stained for p 53 protein and PCNA using the monoclonal antibodies 1801 and PC- 10, respectively, in a standard avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. RESULTS [...] Of the 61 lung carcinomas 35 (57 %) were positive for p 53 (range 1 % to 90 %). Ninety percent of the non-oat SCLC contained positive cells and the labelling index (LI) was significantly higher than that of the oat SCLC (p < 0. 001). SLCC also displayed a higher p 53 LI than NSCLC (p < 0. 01); no difference was found between squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma. A p 53 LI of greater than 1 % tended to be associated with nodal metastases (p < 0. 05), and p 53 expression in node positive tumours as well as in <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas was indicative of poorer survival (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 1, respectively). A p 53 Li of greater than 60 % was a negative prognostic factor in non-oat SCLC (p < 0. 05). PCNA LI was highest in non-oat SCLC and lowest in NSCLC; <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas had a mean LI intermediate between NSCLC and non-oat SCLC (NSCLC v <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma p < 0. 05 and <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> v non-oat cell carcinomas p < 0. 01). A PCNA LI was not correlated with nodal metastases or survival, but there was a significant positive correlation between PCNA LI and p 53 LI (rs = 0. 484, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS [...] p 53 and PCNA expression differ substantially among the various types of lung carcinomas. Substantial differences were also found between oat and non-oat types of SCLC, indicating that SCLC is heterogeneous as far as proliferation rate and altered p 53 expression is concerned. p 53 seems to be of some prognostic value.

Iodine staining method revealed that relatively large amounts of xyloglucans {{were present in the}} water-soluble hemicellulose (HC-B) and water-soluble polysaccharide (WS) frac-tions. (2) IAA did not cause remarkable changes in xyloglucan contents in the hemi-cellulose, but significantly increased the xyloglucan content in the WS fraction.

In {{the treatment of the}} first <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> xenograft, 200 mg kg- 1 Cy produced a growth delay of 34 days in the unprimed group and 45 days in the primed group. At a dose of 300 mg kg- 1 a growth delay could not be assessed in the control group as 16 / 17 of these unprimed mice bearing this xenograft died. However, 14 / 22 tumours went into complete remission in this group before death occurred. In contrast only 3 / 16 deaths occurred in the group of mice that were primed before receiving the same challenge dose. In these animals 19 / 26 tumours went into complete remission and were still completely absent when the experiment was terminated at 60 days. Using the second <b>oat</b> <b>cell</b> xenograft, 300 mg kg- 1 Cy produced a growth delay of 27 days. However, at this dose level all the animals were dead by day 46.

Embryological and clinical evidences are reviewed that indicate the close interrelationship of the argentaffin system and pancreatic islets.

Double inoculation experiments were performed where each cereal species was first attacked by its appropriate f. sp., as inducer, and later by the different ff. spp. as challenger. Infection by the appropriate inducer profoundly affected cellular responses to challenger attack. Suppression of defensive responses was dramatic within epidermal cells containing the inducer haustorium, evident to some extent in adjacent cells, but undetectable at two cells distance. Suppression of penetration resistance allowed most challenger attacks, even by inappropriate ff. spp., to form a haustorium. Furthermore, death of penetrated epidermal cells was also suppressed so that haustoria of the inappropriate ff. spp. functioned to support colony development. In <b>oat,</b> delayed epidermal <b>cell</b> death prevented full colony development by inappropriate ff. spp., but in barley and wheat, no cell death was apparent by four days after inoculation and colonies of the inappropriate ff. spp. produced extensive hyphae, secondary haustoria and conidial chains.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{has been proven}} that ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) might {{play an important role}} in the oncogenesis and progression of numerous malignant tumors. The aim of this study is to detect the mRNA and protein expression of <b>OAT</b> in non-small <b>cell</b> lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as to analyze the bioinformatic features and binary interactions. Methods OAT mRNA expression was detected in A 549 and 16 HBE cell lines by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. OAT protein expression was determined in 55 cases of NSCLC and 17 cases of adjacent non-tumor lung tissues by immunohistochemical staining. The bioinformatic features and binary interactions of OAT were analyzed. Gene ontology annotation and signal pathway analysis were performed. Results OAT mRNA expression in A 549 cells was 2. 85 -fold lower than that in 16 HBE <b>cells.</b> <b>OAT</b> protein expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than that in adjacent non-tumor lung tissues. A significant difference of OAT protein expression was existed between squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma (P< 0. 05), but was not correlated with the gender, age, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and TNM stages. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that OAT was a highly homologous and stable protein located in the mitochondria. An aminotran- 3 domain and several sites of phosphorylation, which may function in signal transduction, gene transcription, and molecular transit, were found. In the 54 selected binary interactions of OAT, TNF and TRAF 6 play roles in the NF-κB pathway. Conclusion OAT may {{play an important role in}} the oncogenesis and progression of NSCLC. Thus, OAT may be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC or a new target for its treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} a {{naturally}} occurring small-molecule antimitotic called diazonamide A. Diazonamide A is highly effective at blocking spindle assembly in mammalian cell culture and does so through a unique mechanism. A biotinylated form of diazonamide A affinity purifies ornithine δ-amino transferase (OAT), a mitochondrial enzyme, from HeLa cell and Xenopus egg extracts. In the latter system, {{the interaction between}} diazonamide A and OAT is regulated by RanGTP. We find that specific OAT knockdown in human cervical carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells by RNA interference blocks cell division and causes cell death, the effects largely phenocopying diazonamide A treatment in these cell lines. Our experiments reveal an unanticipated, paradoxical role for <b>OAT</b> in mitotic <b>cell</b> division and identify the protein as a target for chemotherapeutic drug development...|$|R
