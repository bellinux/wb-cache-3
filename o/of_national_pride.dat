On {{the final day of}} commercial service, public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Portugal, in contrast, {{resisted}} diplomatic solutions. It viewed {{its continued}} possession of its Indian enclaves {{as a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> and, in 1951, it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is {{regarded}} as one of the most important in the histories of Poland and Lithuania. In the history of Ukraine, the battle is better associated with Vytautas the Great, who stood as the leader of Eastern Orthodox Christianity at that time. In Lithuania the victory is synonymous with the Grand Duchy's political and military peak. It was a source <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> during the age of Romantic nationalism and inspired resistance to the Germanization and Russification policies of the German and Russian Empires. The Knights were portrayed as bloodthirsty invaders and Grunwald as a just victory achieved by a small, oppressed nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride,</b> but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
50|$|The {{usage of}} Standessheibe became fashionable in 1485 {{along with the}} Swiss {{illustrated}} chronicles. This was as a result <b>of</b> increased <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> due to recent victories in the Burgundian Wars.|$|R

50|$|Territoriality {{can also}} be {{associated}} with nation-states. Government and social ideas are also associated with territoriality. A nation-state can establish common ideals amongst its citizens which lead to territoriality. Nationalism is an example <b>of</b> this. <b>National</b> <b>pride,</b> common religious practices, and politics all {{play a role in}} a state's territoriality.|$|R

25|$|In 1942, two of {{the outer}} Aleutian Islands—Attu and Kiska—were {{occupied}} by the Japanese and their recovery for the U.S. became a matter <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride.</b> The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.|$|E
25|$|Pride {{in being}} German {{remained}} a difficult issue; {{one of the}} surprises of the 2006 FIFA World Cup which was held in Germany, were widespread displays <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> by Germans, which seemed to take even the Germans themselves by surprise and cautious delight.|$|E

25|$|The {{inconsistencies}} <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> {{were not}} confined to {{the eastern side of the}} Tasman: public opinion polls showed that while New Zealanders were strongly opposed to Qantas buying into Air New Zealand, and moderately opposed to SIA increasing its stake, Australians were in favour of a Qantas buy-out of Air New Zealand but objected to any further SIA ownership of Air New Zealand (and thus Ansett)..|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} had the idea of {{entering}} the army, for the measures taken to fill the ranks rendered the military service distasteful in the extreme to the English people. Since the days of Agincourt the English army had never gained any brilliant successes abroad, and there was consequently none <b>of</b> that <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> which now exists in its bravery and glorious history.|$|R
40|$|The {{argument}} that the European Union (EU) suffers from a democratic deficit is commonly defended by the {{argument that}} as a polity, it is too diverse. This {{raises the question of}} whether other heterogeneous polities are democratically illegitimate as well. We examine democratic support by analyzing the conditions for perceived democratic legitimacy in diverse and non-diverse polities. First, we show that there is no correlation between diversity and democratic support. Second, we examine the role of decentralization, diversity, the nature <b>of</b> federalism and <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> in federal systems. Again, low diversity is not found to be a relevant condition for democratic support. In addition, combinations <b>of</b> high <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> with dual federalism and low <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> with cooperative federalism are found to be sufficient for a high perception of democratic legitimacy. In the conclusion, we address the implications of these findings for the EU's quest to increase its democratic support. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of King David Kalakaua as a matter <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).|$|E
25|$|Modern Indonesian nationalists {{have also}} invoked {{the name of}} Srivijaya, along with Majapahit, {{as a source of}} pride in Indonesia's past greatness. Srivijaya has become the focus <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> and {{regional}} identity, especially for the people of Palembang, South Sumatra province, and the Malay people as a whole. For the people of Palembang, Srivijaya has also become a source of artistic inspiration for Gending Sriwijaya song and traditional dance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} {{regard it}} as desecration to make toilet paper, napkins, doormats, and other such items bearing {{the image of the}} flag, so that the flag's image will be destroyed or soiled. It is, however, increasingly common in some countries to see clothing with the image of the flag forming a substantial part of the piece.

25|$|Tsar Nicholas I (r. 1826–1855) of the Russian Empire {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} Russification, including Cyrillisation. From the 1840s on, Russia considered introducing the Cyrillic script for spelling the Polish language, with the first school books printed in the 1860s. The imperial government's attempts failed, however: the Polish population put up a tough resistance, as it saw its language as expressed in its Latin alphabet as a source <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride,</b> and threatened to rebel {{if it were to}} be abolished.|$|E
25|$|German {{nationalism}} {{has been}} generally {{viewed in the}} country as taboo and people within Germany have struggled {{to find ways to}} acknowledge its past but take pride in its past and present accomplishments - the German question has never been fully resolved in this regard. A wave <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> swept the country when it hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Far-right parties that stress German national identity and pride and seek to exclude or denigrate non-Germans have existed since the end of World War II but have never governed.|$|E
25|$|Self-sufficiency had {{traditionally}} been a powerful stimulus for exploring and developing the country's huge, yet widely dispersed, resource base. It remained a source <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>pride</b> that the Soviet Union, alone among {{the industrialized countries}} of the world, could claim the ability to satisfy almost all the requirements of its economy using its own natural resources. The abundance of fossil fuels supplied not just the Soviet Union's domestic needs. For many years, an ample surplus was exported to consumers in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where it earned most of the Soviet Union's convertible currency.|$|E
