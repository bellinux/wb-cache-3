5|$|The Minister <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies</b> (Taichang 太常) {{also known}} as Grand Master <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies,</b> was the chief {{official}} in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers, {{and the maintenance of}} ancestral temples and altars. The role's title was changed to Upholder <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies</b> (Fengchang 奉常) from 195 to 144 BC before reverting to the original title. Although his main concern was to link the emperor with the supernatural world and Heaven, he was also given the task of setting educational standards for the Imperial University (est. 124 BC) and the academic chairs (boshi 博士) who specialized in the Five Classics, the canon of Confucianism.|$|E

5|$|Born in Metz, Custine was {{a son of}} Philippe-Joseph, comte de Custine, and Anne-Marguerite Maguin, {{daughter}} of Francois, comte d' Roussy and Marguerite de Walter. His father, the tenth count, had died at the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, one of six French generals killed in the engagement. Custine's other titles included Signeur de Guermagne and de Sareck, and he was, after 1770, also the lord of Niderviller, a property he purchased. He married Adelaide-Celeste Louise Gagnat de Longny. In 1790 Custine's daughter, Adelaide-Anne-Philippe, married Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé, master <b>of</b> <b>ceremonies</b> for Louis XVI. She and her husband {{spent much of the}} early 1790s as refugees in Britain, although he returned to France several times to visit his estates; he was eventually confirmed as a peer of France, resumed his pre-Revolution position as master <b>of</b> <b>ceremonies,</b> this time for Louis XVIII, and was awarded military rank.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community.

Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the inaugural}} 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his {{suggestion}} to bestow {{the winner of}} the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce {{that the only way to}} bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies.</b> Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{the past}} {{cardinal}} electors could be accompanied by attendants ("conclavists"), now only a nurse may accompany a cardinal who for reasons of ill-health, as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals, needs such assistance. The Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, two Masters <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies,</b> two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the Dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave. Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{interest}} in the war memorials diminished considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, reflected in a reduced level <b>of</b> <b>ceremonies</b> and a simplification of the commemorative events around memorials. In the post-war years, for example, the separate official and veterans ceremonies at the Verdun memorials blended into one; in 1956, German and French ceremonies were also united into a single event. Attendance at events like Anzac Day diminished. Many memorials slowly deteriorated: {{in some cases the}} original inter-war funding had never included maintenance, in other cases the materials used to construct the memorials were not durable. In some towns and cities, the memorials were moved to less prominent locations as part of urban renewal projects, or hidden by new buildings. World War I memorials were commonplace in many countries and were paid little attention.|$|E
5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days <b>of</b> <b>ceremonies</b> celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E

5|$|One of the Minister of Ceremonies' many {{subordinates}} was the Court Astronomer (Taishi ling 太史令; {{also known}} as the Prefect Grand Astrologer), who made astronomical observations and drafted the annual lunisolar calendar. The Court Astronomer also upheld a literacy test of 9,000 characters for nominees aspiring to become subordinate officials for either the Minister Steward or Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk. These nominees were often recommended subordinates of commandery-level Administrators. Other subordinates of the Minister <b>of</b> <b>Ceremonies</b> reported illegal acts at ancestral temples, prepared sacrificial offerings of food and wine at shrines and temples, and arranged for the music and dancing that accompanied ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The foreign press {{suggested}} that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 {{to avoid the}} gossip which swept London society {{in the wake of}} the scandal. This is not true; the trip had actually been planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most of the extensive travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part <b>of</b> <b>ceremonies.</b> In the style of the time, a great many animals were shot for sport.|$|E
