The welding process {{is represented by the}} energy conservation equation where the moving electrode is incorporated considering an <b>oval</b> <b>shaped</b> Gaussian heat source. The governing equation is solved based on the Green function solution and subsequently considered the effect of heat in the weld pool and convection after welding. The prediction agrees well with the experiments and it was found that an <b>oval</b> <b>shape</b> is a better approximation for the heat source...|$|R

40|$|As {{method for}} {{punching}} in <b>oval</b> <b>shapes</b> is not readily available, press tool for punching in <b>oval</b> <b>shapes</b> {{is required in}} various industries according to their applications. There are press tools for punching in circular shape, but when shapes other than circular shape are desired, they have to design according to dimensions required by industry. As application for <b>oval</b> <b>shape</b> punching differs from industry to industry because dimensions required by industries differ from each other. As some industries require more than one <b>oval</b> <b>shaped</b> holes {{that is to be}} done in single stroke for reducing the time required for production, there is need to design such press tool which can perform such operation. Hence to have fast production of required oval size holes, there is need to develop a press tool assembly which can make accurate oval holes on metal sheets. For designing such assembly, it is very necessary to study every aspect of existing design of press tool so that changes required can be easily define. Comparison of existing design with the proposed enables us to find correct way of design...|$|R
