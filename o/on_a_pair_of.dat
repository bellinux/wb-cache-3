5|$|Not long thereafter, the film-directing team of Dan Pița and Mircea Veroiu {{found that}} Agârbiceanu's short stories {{supplied}} ideal material for {{their interest in}} formal experimentation, leading to two films, each based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> his stories: Nunta de piatră (1972) and Duhul aurului (1974). In 1988, Nicolae Mărgineanu and Ion Brad also filmed their version of Arhanghelii, as Flames over Treasures.|$|E

Imhotep prepares to {{sacrifice}} Evelyn, {{but she is}} rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests. When Evelyn reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, Imhotep becomes mortal again, and Rick forces him into the River of Death. Imhotep leaves {{the world of the}} living, vowing revenge. While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. Ardeth rides away as Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> camels laden with Beni's treasure.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} March 1942, the Eastern Fleet {{had been}} formed, {{under the command of}} Admiral James Somerville. The fleet was centred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> fleet {{aircraft}} carriers, the elderly carrier , and five battleships, four of which were Royal Sovereign and her sisters; the fifth was Warspite. The fleet also included seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers. Despite the numerical strength of the Eastern Fleet, many of its units, including the four Revenge-class battleships, were no longer front-line warships. Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's powerful Kido Butai, composed of six carriers and four fast battleships, was significantly stronger than Somerville's Eastern Fleet. As a result, only the modernised Warspite could operate with the two fleet carriers; Royal Sovereign, her three sisters, and Hermes were kept away from combat to escort convoys in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's first {{preseason game}} {{was a victory}} over the Bills in Akron. The Browns scored three touchdowns in the first quarter, first on an {{interception}} return by Cliff Lewis and then <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> passes from quarterback Otto Graham to Dean Sensanbaugher and Mac Speedie. Sensanbaugher scored another touchdown {{in the second quarter}} on a pass from Lewis, who came in to substitute for Graham. By the time fullback Marion Motley ran for a short touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 35–0, coach Paul Brown had pulled most of the team's starters. Buffalo proceeded to mount a comeback, scoring one touchdown in the third quarter and two in the fourth. Buffalo's final score came on a punt return received by Rex Bumgardner. As he was about to be tackled at the Cleveland 20-yard line, Bumgardner pitched the ball to teammate Bill Heywood, who ran {{the rest of the way}} for the touchdown. Cleveland and Buffalo both had 12 first downs and 206 yards of rushing, but the Browns had 159 yards of passing to Buffalo's 127, helping secure the 35–21 win.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the White team scored {{a pair of}} touchdowns on {{successive}} possessions and took a 17–9 lead. Both were made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long Phillip Sims touchdown passes to Chris Black on a 44-yard reception and to Yeldon on a 50-yard reception. The Crimson team responded with a two-play, 70-yard drive that saw a Demetrius Hart run of 23 yards and a 47-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Kenny Bell. After the unsuccessful two-point conversion, the White team led 17–15 {{at the end of}} the third quarter. In the fourth, both defenses again held both offenses scoreless. The only points came late in the game when Vinnie Sunseri recovered a Michael Williams fumble and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown and a 24–15 White victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win at the Glass Bowl. Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Jason Pace touchdowns. The first came on a nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due to having the tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E
5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E
5|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half and started their fifth offensive drive from their own 18. After they gained a first down on a short pass <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> runs, the Alabama defense stopped the Tigers on their next series to force a punt. Alabama then started from their own 48, but were only able to muster a three and out. This resulted in their first punt of the night from Cody Mandell. With Lee back at quarterback for LSU, he threw his second interception, this time to Mark Barron, to give Alabama possession at the LSU 35. Again the LSU defense held the Alabama offense in check to set up another long field goal attempt. This time Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal to give the Crimson Tide a 6–3 lead. On the next drive, LSU was able to gain a pair of first downs primarily with only runs by Jefferson and Ford, but again were forced to punt. Alabama started this drive from their own 11, {{and was able to}} gain a pair of first downs on McCarron passes before he threw an interception to Morris Claiborne that was returned to the Alabama 15. The quarter ended two plays later after a pair of LSU runs resulted in no gain.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 2013, Harris {{signed with}} the Orlando Magic for {{training}} camp. A long shot to make the 15-man roster, Harris was waived on October 25. On December 7, Harris' rights were acquired by Los Angeles D-Fenders in a trade with the Canton Charge. In his D-Fenders debut on December 14, 2013 against the Santa Cruz Warriors, he scored 41 points. He also had a professional career-high 5 steals, 4 rebounds and 3 assists. On December 16, {{he was one of}} the top D-League players of the week. On December 23, he was again one of the top D-league players of the week, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 20+ point performances. He was also a finalist for D-League Player of the Month. Harris averaged 29.3 points per game for the week ending January 5, leading his team in scoring and to victory in each of the three games. As a result, he earned his first D-League player of the week award of the season and third of his career. On January 10, Harris posted 49 points along with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, 3 assists and a block against the Idaho Stampede. The 49 points was a Los Angeles D-Fenders franchise record. and tied the 2013-14 NBADL season high set earlier by Pierre Jackson. On January 13, Harris earned his second consecutive NBA Development League Performer of the Week award. On January 13, Harris scored 42 against the Maine Red Claws to improve his season scoring average to 30.6, taking the league lead from Jackson. In 13 games with the D-Fenders, Harris averaged a league-leading 30.6 points, league-leading 8.9 free throws made and a league-leading 10.2 free throws attempted. He also averaged 6.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.1 steals (6th in the league), while shooting 48.5%.|$|E
5|$|Playing floorball in the off-season, Salo tore his {{achilles tendon}} on 22 July 2010. After {{undergoing}} surgery, he was sidelined {{for the first}} four months of the 2010–11 season. The injury was so severe that Salo later admitted thinking his career was over during his rehabilitation. Before returning to the Canucks lineup, he was sent to the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, for a conditioning assignment. Making his AHL debut on 4 February 2011, he scored two goals for the Moose in a 3–2 win against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Salo played two more games for the Moose, going pointless in both, before being called up by the Canucks on 11 February. Salo appeared in 27 games in 2010–11, recording three goals and four assists. During the first and second rounds of the 2011 playoffs, Salo missed four games with a leg injury. The Canucks eliminated the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds to qualify for the Western Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks. During Game 4 of the series, Salo set a Canucks playoff record for fastest back-to-back goals, scoring 16 seconds apart <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 5-on-3 powerplays. The feat also tied Larry Murphy's NHL record for fastest two power play goals in the playoffs since 1957. Combined with Ryan Kesler's goal a minute and thirty-nine seconds previously, the trio of goals were also the fastest scored in Canucks playoff history at a minute and fifty-five seconds. Vancouver {{went on to win the}} game 4–2, while winning the series 4–1. Advancing to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, the Canucks were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. During the off-season, Salo re-signed with the Canucks to a one-year, $2 million deal on 1 July 2011, prior to becoming an unrestricted free agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the I Squadron went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{training}} cruises during 9–19 January and 27 February– 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, {{with an emphasis}} on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Wilhelm II and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
