5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the game}} was {{available}} either as a standalone packaged game, {{or as part of}} a special pack, which included one of only 25,000 limited edition, Zelda-themed Game Boy Advance SP. The Triforce SP is matte gold in color, with a Triforce logo stamped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> and the Hyrule royal family crest printed on the lower right face. As a launch promotion, Nintendo Europe also produced seven 24-carat gold plated Game Boy Advance SP consoles, with six given away to people who found a golden ticket inside their Triforce SP package, and a seventh as a magazine promotion. Thirty were autographed by Miyamoto himself {{at the opening of the}} Nintendo World Store in New York.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the Mucorales, Apophysomyces species often fail to sporulate under {{standard}} clinical laboratory culture conditions. These fungi require Czapek's agar (CZA), a nutrient-defined medium. Colonies grow rapidly at 37°C on CZA and initially appear white and woolly becoming greyish brown with age. Colonies are grey and floccose, will grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of the petri dish, and are colourless on reverse. Sporangiosphores are unbranched, smooth-walled, and light brown. Sporangia are apophyseal, pyriform, beginning as whitish and turning brown with maturity. Sporangiospores are variable in size and shape. Sexuality has not been observed in A. variabilis.|$|E
25|$|At Framlingham Castle the Duke kept two silver-gilt cups {{engraved}} with {{the arms of}} James IV, which he bequeathed to Cardinal Wolsey in 1524. The Duke's descendants presented the College of Arms with a sword, a dagger and a turquoise ring in 1681. The family tradition was either that these items belonged to James IV or were arms carried by Thomas Howard at Flodden. The sword blade is signed by the maker Maestre Domingo of Toledo. There is some doubt whether the weapons are of the correct period. The Earl of Arundel was painted by Philip Fruytiers, following Anthony van Dyck's 1639 composition, with his ancestor's sword, gauntlet and helm from Flodden. Thomas Lord Darcy retrieved a powder flask belonging to James IV {{and gave it to}} Henry VIII. A cross with rubies and sapphires with a gold chain worn by James and a hexagonal table-salt with the figure of St Andrews <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> were given to Henry by James Stanley, Bishop of Ely.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{butterfly}} keyboard {{is split}} into two roughly triangular pieces that slide as <b>the</b> laptop's <b>lid</b> is opened or closed. As <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is opened both pieces slide out to the sides, followed by one piece sliding downward. The two halves mesh to form a keyboard 29.2 cm (11.5 in) wide which overhangs {{the sides of the}} laptop body. Conversely, as <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is closed one piece slides back, then both slide inward until the keyboard can be covered by <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> <b>The</b> movement of the keyboard is driven by a cam <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid's</b> hinge, so <b>the</b> motions of the keyboard parts are always synchronized with the movement of <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|R

500|$|The Zenbook {{name was}} {{proposed}} by Asus chairman Jonney Shih {{to reflect the}} [...] "zen philosophy" [...] applied to the design. The chief designer, Loewy Chen, had wanted to incorporate design elements from luxury watches into his products for a long time. Zenbooks were the first opportunity to put this into practice, the crossover being achieved, he said, by [...] "the unfolding of the laptop from the side recalling the elegance of minute and hour hand movements". The reference to watches is also reflected in the marketing of Zenbooks; Asus published design sketches overlaying an open Zenbook on a watch face, and video advertisements feature similar imagery. The concentric circles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of [...] were intended to look like ripples in water and to reflect [...] "philosophical ideas such as the infinite nature of Zen thinking and self-improvement".|$|E

He confronts Rob with evidence of his role in Pankow's murder - a vial of Rob's diet pills with a bloody fingerprint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> - and attempts to blackmail him. Later that day, Rob intrudes Spinks' residence to retrieve his pills, but hides in a closet when Spinks returns; noticing that someone is in his home, Spinks arms himself with a baseball bat. As Spinks heads to the closet, Rob takes off his disguise, opens the closet door, and reveals his true self to a stunned Spinks before killing him. Rob later meets with Dr. Mindy Rinehart, a counselor hired by Lucky Boy to consult the employees following Pankow's killing. In session with her, Rob admits that he is battling an [...] "eating disorder." [...] Rinehart sends him to an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, not fully understanding Rob's true nature.|$|E
500|$|When Taft entered office, Mexico was {{increasingly}} restless under {{the grip of}} longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz. Many Mexicans backed his opponent, Francisco Madero. There {{were a number of}} incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the US Army to the border areas for maneuvers. Taft told his military aide, Archibald Butt, that [...] "I am going to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> and it will take a great deal to pry me off". He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only {{a few feet from the}} two presidents. Before the election in Mexico, Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero, whose supporters took up arms. This resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the U.S.'s Arizona Territory, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft was against an aggressive response and so instructed the territorial governor.|$|E

500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Super Furry Animals and Martin McCarthy, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as a single. The video begins with a shot of Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo, which appears {{on the cover of}} [...] "Northern Lites", displayed above the words [...] "Public information service". This shot fades to show a full-screen translucent, fluorescent blue, image of the [...] "warrior", also from the single's cover, which moves from the centre to the bottom right before shrinking and remaining stationary in the top right {{for the duration of the}} video. The SFA logo from the introduction is shown in the top left, opposite the [...] "warrior" [...] image, and also remains throughout the video. The island Ailsa Craig is briefly shown, the island where in 2004 when the single was released, 60 to 70% of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport, the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales. Next, images of the sea and birds in flight are shown before footage of a bearded man, sitting on rocks beside the sea and singing along to the first verse is shown. This footage is intercut with shots of a man using a hammer and chisel on some boulders before walking away with a large rock. The rock is shown being spun and polished into a curling stone. A yellow handle is added to the stone and it is placed into a wooden box alongside another stone with a red handle. The box is closed and the word Nagano is seen printed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> The video then cuts to shots of a Boeing 747 before wintery scenes of Nagano are shown, including a shot of people with umbrellas stood in the snow in front of a sign that reads [...] "Nagano Olympics". Footage from curling events are then shown until 2 minutes and 40 seconds when the video cuts to show a man in a grey suit dropping a handful of grass on a road. The video then ends with shots of Irish road bowling–several men are shown throwing a bowl down a road surrounded by spectators alongside scenes of men with measuring sticks and men exchanging banknotes. In a 2008 interview with Uncut, Gruff Rhys stated that [...] "Northern Lites" [...] "didn't have a video" [...] and suggested this as the reason the track was not a [...] bigger hit than it was. The director who was originally scheduled to work on the video took up an offer of a Red Stripe commercial in Jamaica, leaving the band to collaborate with McCarthy. According to Rhys the group met the original director later and told him [...] "We understand, we'd have done the same." [...] Despite this, bassist Guto Pryce has described the [...] "Northern Lites" [...] music video as one of only a handful of the group's videos that he actually likes.|$|E

2500|$|Enameled {{cast iron}} {{cookware}} {{was developed in}} the 1920s.
