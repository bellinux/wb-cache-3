Wallis' study <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> also led to an article by Wallis in the Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in 2009 led to Church of Scientology-owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology. The Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> {{has long had}} a controversial history on the Internet, and has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical of itself from the web. From early in Wikipedia's history, conflict arose within the topic <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> on the website. Disputes began in earnest in 2005, with users disagreeing {{about whether or not}} to describe Scientology as an abusive cult or religion. By 2006, disagreements concerning the topic <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> on Wikipedia had grown more specific. Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims <b>of</b> <b>Scientology,</b> as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 Salon {{reported}} that Scientologists were now blocked from viewing sites critical <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> including Operation Clambake and alt.religion.scientology, {{through the use}} of a content-control software program referred to by critics as Scieno Sitter. The Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> was unable to shut down Operation Clambake's internet service provider in Norway. The organization succeeded in shutting down the upstream connection to the site's internet service provider, Netherlands-based Xtended Internet. In November 2002, Xtended Internet's upstream provider, Cignal Global Communications received a letter from Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> counsel alleging copyright and trademark infringement involved with Xenu.net. This letter led to Cignal Global Communications, a United States-based company, terminating its service with Xtended Internet, which had to move their company to a new backbone provider.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status <b>of</b> <b>Scientology,</b> finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{research}} was assisted {{by a set}} of Hubbard's personal papers obtained by Gerry Armstrong, a disaffected former employee of the Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology.</b> Armstrong had been preparing material for an official biography of Hubbard, but left the Church in 1981 after finding that Hubbard's claims about his life conflicted with independent sources. The Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> obtained an injunction in California to prevent Armstrong from further distributing the documents. However, English courts refused to enforce this order.|$|E

5|$|The German Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff {{and members of the}} Church <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities <b>of</b> <b>Scientology</b> in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
