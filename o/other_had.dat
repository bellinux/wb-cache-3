5|$|One {{of three}} wolves that escaped from a zoo in Gulf Shores, Alabama during Hurricane Danny {{was found in}} November later that year, after {{seasonal}} conditions meant less tourists and therefore less food in Gulf State Park where the wolf had resided. One of the other wolves had already been recaptured, while the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> already been shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did {{not speak}} to one another again {{following}} their fight for 33 years, until {{they were asked to}} participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, played between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined with Evers in signing a 10-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, The Rolling Stones {{performed}} in Singapore {{as part of}} their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.|$|E

5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> been invited.

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{left his}} {{headquarters}} at Keynsham Abbey and moved towards Bath, which {{had also been}} occupied by royalist troops, making entry into the city impossible. Monmouth camped in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham's forces, which had now combined into a larger force, but were still awaiting their artillery. The Duke of Grafton led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers into the village, where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> taken greater losses.|$|E

5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic contest, with each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander}} in the East Indies, Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier {{was concerned about the}} vulnerability of the China convoy and sent reinforcements to support the lone Royal Navy escort, the ship of the line HMS Intrepid under Captain William Hargood. These reinforcements arrived on 21 January, only six days before the allied squadron arrived off Macau. Hargood sailed to meet the French and Spanish ships, and a chase ensued through the Wanshan Archipelago before contact was lost. Both sides subsequently claimed that the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> refused battle, although it was the allied squadron which withdrew, Hargood later successfully escorting the China convoy safely westwards.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, <b>other</b> <b>had</b> never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped {{computer}} disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.|$|E

The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{making its}} final {{landfall}} in Sinaloa, Paul produced hurricane-force winds recorded at 100mph (160km/h) in Los Mochis. The winds demolished numerous {{homes in the}} region, leaving 140,000 residents homeless and another 400,000 people isolated. The greatest damage occurred 70miles (110km) south of Los Mochis {{in the city of}} Guamuchil; some houses suffered total destruction, while many <b>other</b> <b>had</b> their roof blown off. A total of 24 people were killed by the storm, although it produced beneficial rains over the region.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} phase of the {{operation}} had been scheduled for 8 May, no word was received from the 'Heralds' and so Doomsday was postponed by twenty-four hours. Contact was successfully established on 9 May and the first units of Force 134 arrived in Norway to begin their occupation, including the first elements of 1st Airborne Division and the Norwegian Parachute Company. All but one of the transport aircraft belonging to {{the first phase}} took off and landed in Norway without incident. Phase II was accelerated to compensate for the delay, with aircraft scheduled to leave Britain between 02:00 and 13:30. Unfortunately, after approximately 07:00 poor weather over Oslo caused many transport aircraft heading for the airfield there to return to Britain, although all of those destined for Stavanger landed successfully. Several crash-landed, and one was reported missing. The remaining aircraft took off again on 11 May, with one crashing on takeoff and another going missing; of the two missing aircraft, one landed at another airfield in Norway, but the <b>other</b> <b>had</b> crashed killing all of its occupants, including Air Vice-Marshal Scarlett-Streatfeild. The aircraft belonging to the next two phases suffered no more casualties, although a number of them were again delayed by inclement weather over the Norwegian airfields. 1st Airborne Division suffered one officer and thirty-three other ranks killed, and one other rank wounded, and the Royal Air Force six killed and seven injured. All of these losses had occurred after the general surrender had been declared.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the ecclesiastic see to a dynastic realm ruled by a Protestant prince challenged the principle of ecclesiastical reservation, which was intended to preserve the ecclesiastical electorates from this very possibility. The difficulties of such a conversion had been faced before: Hermann von Wied, a previous prince-elector and archbishop in Cologne, had also converted to Protestantism, but had resigned from his office. Similarly, Gebhard's predecessor, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau had indeed married in 1577, but had resigned from the office prior to his marriage. Furthermore, {{the reason for his}} marriage—to perpetuate his house—differed considerably from Gebhard's. The House of Waldburg was in no apparent danger of extinction; Gebhard was one of six brothers, and only one <b>other</b> <b>had</b> chosen an ecclesiastical career. Unlike his abdicating predecessors, when Gebhard converted, he proclaimed the Reformation in the city of Cologne itself, angering Cologne's Catholic leadership and alienating the Catholic faction in the Cathedral Chapter. Furthermore, Gebhard adhered not to the teachings of Martin Luther, but to those of John Calvin, a form of religious observation not approved by the Augsburg conventions of 1555. Finally, he made no move to resign from his position as Prince-elector.|$|E
