40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} by trinitrotoluene is {{of global}} concern {{due to its}} widespread use in military ordnance and commercial explosives. Despite known long-term persistence in groundwater and soil, the toxicological profile of trinitrotoluene and <b>other</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>wastes</b> have not been systematically measured using in vivo biological assays. Zebrafish embryos are ideal model vertebrates for high-throughput toxicity screening and live in vivo imaging due to their small size and transparency during embryogenesis. Here, we used Single Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) /light sheet microscopy to assess the developmental toxicity of explosive-contaminated water in zebrafish embryos and report 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene-associated developmental abnormalities, including defects in heart formation and circulation, in 3 D. Levels of apoptotic cell death {{were higher in the}} actively developing tissues of trinitrotoluene-treated embryos than controls. Live 3 D imaging of heart tube development at cellular resolution by light-sheet microscopy revealed trinitrotoluene-associated cardiac toxicity, including hypoplastic heart chamber formation and cardiac looping defects, while the real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) quantitatively measured the molecular changes in the heart and blood development supporting the developmental defects at the molecular level. Identification of cellular toxicity in zebrafish using the state-of-the-art 3 D imaging system could form the basis of a sensitive biosensor for environmental contaminants and be further valued by combining it with molecular analysis...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{explosives}} {{operations have}} been and may continue {{to be an important}} component of the DOE mission at the NTS. This mission has been to conduct the nation`s nuclear testing program in a safe, secure, and efficient manner while assuring full compliance with state and federal regulations, and DOE order`s and directives. These operations have generally included assembly, disassembly or modification, staging, transportation, and tesbng of nuclear explosive devices. They may also include maintenance, repair, retrofit, and surveillance. The Device Assembly Facility (DAF) was constructed to provide a dedicated facility in which to prepare nuclear explosives assemblies for their intended disposition. This facility will provide for combined operations (replacing two separate facilities) and incorporates state-of-the-art safety and security features while minimizing the risks of environmental impacts. The facility has been completed but not yet operated, so the impacts to be considered will b e based on normal operations and not on the impacts of construction activities. The impacts will arise from nuclear explosives operations that require the handling of high explosives in combination with special nuclear materials. Wastes from operation of the earlier device assembly facilities have included grams of epoxies, pints of solvents, and small quantities of <b>waste</b> <b>explosives.</b> These are hazardous (includes radioactive) wastes and are disposed of in accordance with state and federal regulations. Assuming similar operations at the DAF, non-hazardous (includes non-radioactive) solid waste would be transported to a permitted landfill. <b>Waste</b> <b>explosives</b> would be sent to the Area 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit. <b>Other</b> hazardous <b>waste</b> would be sent to the Area 5 Radioactive Waste.

40|$|In Sri Lanka the Dye sludge {{production}} from textile industry is large. The {{large amount of}} produced dye sludge needs to be properly managed otherwise it will cause lot of environmental problems. Currently textile industries in Sri Lanka use the landfilling method to dispose dye sludge. Because of the landfilling method lot of environmental problems are surfaced, such as emission of toxic gases, ground water pollution and bad odour in environment. This study investigates the feasibility of using the waste dye sludge as fuel called Refused Derived Fuel (RDF). The method is used to produce RDF from dye sludge is mix dye sludge with <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> available in textile industry. <b>Other</b> <b>waste</b> types which are supposed to use mix with dye sludge are fabrics, paper waste and saw dust. The mixing of waste dye sludge with <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> in different compositions are investigated. Also different quality parameters of waste sludge and mixtures (after mixing with <b>other</b> <b>wastes)</b> are analysed. Calorifc values of waste sludge with different moisture content and mixtures with different waste fractions,ash content,sulfer content,chlorine content,heavy metal content are main characterization parameters. Results analysed and it revealed that by mixing dye sludge with <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> calorific value can be increased from 6 MJ/Kg to 22 MJ/Kg. By considering availability of the waste types {{during the last year}} most commonly used mixture composition is selected. We propose that waste dye sludge mixed with <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> types in textile industry is a suitable and effective alternative energy source in Sri Lank...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the performance of an old existing medical waste incinerator in a district (Temeke) hospital. The medical waste incinerated was grouped into two categories: sharps <b>waste</b> and <b>other</b> <b>waste.</b> The parameters assessed included amounts of sharps and <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> incinerated, amount of fuel used and the incineration cycle time. One incineration cycle was conducted per day and data was collected for 22 months (N = 653). It was established that the total waste incinerated per day ranged from 70 to 120 kg, completing the process between 2 and 4 hrs and consuming 20 to 40 L of fuel per day. The analysis showed further that sharps waste incinerated were 25 % of the total <b>waste</b> while <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> incinerated were about 75 % on average. The average diesel oil used was 30 L/day and average cycle time was observed to be 3 hrs, both being excessively high indicating that the performance of the incin-erator was poor. The statistical analysis was used to reveal stronger variations in <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> than sharps waste. The PDF plots, skewness and kurtosis values indicated that there were weak variations in the daily diesel oil consumed and incineration cycle time while stronger variations were observed in the <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> compared to sharps waste data. Normalization of the incinerator performance data allowed comparison between different data types also indicating poor performance of the incinerator. Proper segregation at point of generation and proper storage of medical waste was recommended. It was further recommended for the hospital to install a new and efficient incinerator with short incineration cycle time and less fuel consumption...|$|R
