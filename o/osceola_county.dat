5|$|However, the 2000s housing bubble {{that drove}} {{significant}} growth of Poinciana collapsed and Avatar {{was unable to}} justify the costs or finance construction of the highway. Around 2010, Avatar decided not to build the highway {{while at the same}} time, the state established the <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> Expressway Authority (OCX) to develop and built a series of toll road segments in <b>Osceola</b> <b>County.</b> The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around the south and east sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area. The Poinciana Parkway is a natural part of the proposed loop road.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> Expressway Authority's 2040 {{master plan}} {{includes}} the Poinciana Parkway in a belt route around the Kissimmee area in northwest <b>Osceola</b> <b>County.</b> Both {{a connection to}} I-4, known as the I-4 Poinciana Parkway Connector, and a connection to Florida's Turnpike, a segment known as the Southport Connector, are undergoing alignment and environmental studies, which {{are expected to be}} completed in mid-2020. The 2040 master plan includes an extension from the intersection of the Southport Connector and Florida's Turnpike around to the east end of the existing Osceola Parkway, including a connection with SR 417 and Orlando International Airport.|$|E
5|$|M-61 {{starts in}} eastern <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> south of Marion at an {{intersection}} with M-115. It runs eastward and meets M-66 before crossing into Clare County. The highway {{runs along the}} boundary between the regions of Northern and Central Michigan through forest land and crosses the Muskegon River en route to Harrison. There it follows Main Street into town to an intersection with 1st Street near Budd Lake. M-61 turns south at the intersection and joins the business loop of US127 (Bus. US127) through town. Bus. US127/M-61 follows Clare Avenue south of the city to exit170 on the US127 freeway. The business loop ends, and M-61 turns east along Gladwin Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{names of}} Florida's {{counties}} reflect its diverse cultural heritage. Some are named for Confederate {{political leaders and}} Spanish explorers, marking the influence of Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Spanish saints, Native American placenames used by the Spanish, and political leaders of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes, and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants {{on both sides of}} Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L.

5|$|M-63 {{originally}} {{ran from}} Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US131) in <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US131 to Tustin {{and then to}} a terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock. This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock. The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control.|$|E
5|$|Passing through rural <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> and {{providing}} access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin, US131 approaches {{the south side of}} Cadillac in Wexford County. At exit176, M-55 leaves a concurrency with M-115 and joins the US131 freeway around the east side of Cadillac. This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business loop through downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit180 while US131 continues around the east side of Cadillac and north around the east side of Manton. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US131, 7,455cars and 709trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton's business loop.|$|E

5|$|Two {{changes were}} made in the routing of US10 by 1929. As shown on the maps of the time, US10 was rerouted to bypass Flint. The former routing through the city was {{redesigned}} M-10. A second change moved the highway to its present routing west of Baldwin to the Lake–Mason county line. A bypass of downtown Midland was opened in 1934. The previous routing through town was initially renumbered US 10A. A rerouting project in <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> started in 1936. By the end of the year, a new roadway was opened between Sears and M-66. Until the second segment of the project was completed two years later, US10 was routed concurrently with M-66. When the new routing between M-66 and Lake in Clare County was opened, that concurrency was eliminated and all the previous routings were transferred to local control.|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1960s. By the end of 1963, the southern section of freeway was extended to Schoolcraft. The following year, a business loop in Kalamazoo was created. The new loop used a freeway stub on the north and M-43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown. A discontinuous segment of freeway, south of Cadillac into <b>Osceola</b> <b>County,</b> opened in September 1966. The freeway was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the Comstock Park area in 1966. That year, the former Grand Rapids Speedrome, a local race car track was closed. Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive, the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the freeway construction in 1966. The freeway was extended further to M-57 (14Mile Road) near Cedar Springs in 1969.|$|E

From this junction, M-115 runs west following the former routing of US10 along Ludington Drive to Farwell. In the middle of town, M-115 turns northwesterly to meet {{the end of the}} US10 freeway near Surrey Lake. The highway continues northwest through forest lands and lake country. The trunkline passes into northern <b>Osceola</b> <b>County</b> near its crossing of the Muskegon River. There are intersections with both M-66 and M-61 south of Marion near rural farms. The roadway subsequently crosses into southern Wexford County. Near Stone Lake south of Cadillac, M-115 meets US131 and M-55. M-55 leaves the US131 freeway and joins M-115, and the two run concurrently along the western end of Lake Cadillac. They separate near Lake Mitchell, and M-115 turns northwesterly between the two lakes passing Mitchell State Park and the eastern shore of the latter lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} turns north, {{away from}} the river, as it nears the stadium and passes through {{the remainder of the}} northern suburb, changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County. M-46 joins US131 from the west at Cedar Springs and the two highways pass into northwestern Montcalm County near Sand Lake. North of Pierson the landscape is dominated by forests. M-46 turns east and leaves the freeway near Howard City while US131 continues into Mecosta County near the Little Muskegon River. The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the Manistee National Forest near the river and north to Big Rapids. Further north M-20 joins the US131 freeway near Stanwood and the two highways cross the Muskegon River on the way to Big Rapids. The city is served by its own business loop and M-20 turns east off the freeway along Bus. US131 toward the main campus of Ferris State University.
