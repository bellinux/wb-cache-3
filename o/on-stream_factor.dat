40|$|The {{currently}} preferred {{means of}} particulate removal from process or combustion gas generated by advanced coal-based power production processes is filtration with candle filters. However, candle filters have not shown the requisite reliability to be commercially viable for hot gas clean up for either integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) or pressurized fluid bed combustion (PFBC) processes. Even a single candle failure {{can lead to}} unacceptable ash breakthrough, which can result in (a) damage to highly sensitive and expensive downstream equipment, (b) unacceptably low system <b>on-stream</b> <b>factor,</b> and (c) unplanned outages. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{recognized the need to}} have fail-safe devices installed within or downstream from candle filters. In addition to CeraMem, DOE has contracted with Siemens-Westinghouse, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota, and the Southern Research Institute (SRI) to develop novel fail-safe devices. Siemens-Westinghouse is evaluating honeycomb-based filter devices on the clean-side of the candle filter that can operate up to 870 C. The EERC is developing a highly porous ceramic disk with a sticky yet temperature-stable coating that will trap dust in the event of filter failure. SRI is developing the Full-Flow Mechanical Safeguard Device that provides a positive seal for the candle filter. Operation of the SRI device is triggered by the higher-than-normal gas flow from a broken candle. The CeraMem approach {{is similar to that of}} Siemens-Westinghouse and involves the development of honeycomb-based filters that operate on the clean-side of a candle filter. The overall objective of this project is to fabricate and test silicon carbide-based honeycomb failsafe filters for protection of downstream equipment in advanced coal conversion processes. The fail-safe filter, installed directly downstream of a candle filter, should have the capability for stopping essentially all particulate bypassing a broken or leaking candle while having a low enough pressure drop to allow the candle to be backpulse-regenerated. Forward-flow pressure drop should increase by no more than 20 % because of incorporation of the fail-safe filter...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a unique}} {{approach to the}} mathematical modelling of the extraction life-cycle of any depleting fossil-fuel resource and is applied to crude-oil and natural-gas production. The skewed-normal production-profile (i. e. production rate versus time) model, (i) yields a better representation than can be achieved with earlier approaches, and (ii) is appropriate for use with production data that rise quickly with time to a peak and then slowly decline, but is unsatisfactory for use when the profile exhibits more than one peak. In many circumstances the profile is less systematatic in shape, often {{as a result of}} temporary political, economic or <b>on-stream</b> <b>factors.</b> Under such circumstances, it is suggested that the skewed-normal production-profile (SNPP) model be used in conjunction with the reverse-projection (RP) technique. The application of the model, without and with a reverse projection through the data, is demonstrated briefly using UK crude-oil and natural-gas production rates. ...|$|R
