5|$|Apples {{are often}} eaten raw. The whole fruit {{including}} {{the skin is}} {{suitable for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E
5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and <b>often</b> <b>not</b> {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E

5|$|Female Quakers local to {{the area}} {{organized}} the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, {{who was not a}} Quaker. They planned the event during a visit {{to the area}} by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were <b>often</b> <b>not</b> allowed to speak in public.|$|E
5|$|From early November, chicks begin {{moulting}} into juvenile plumage, {{which takes}} {{up to two}} months and is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> completed {{by the time they}} leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and {{spend the rest of the}} summer feeding there.|$|E
5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, {{some of these}} officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was <b>often</b> <b>not</b> given.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Jair {{played on}} the same team as Diego, and was a slimmer, more {{technically}} able player, but had less focus; the two were <b>often</b> <b>not</b> fielded {{at the same time in}} order to prevent arguments.

5|$|Legislation {{concerning}} the national symbols {{is far from}} perfect. The Coat of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive ordinances, {{some of which have}} never been issued. Moreover, the Act contains errors, omissions and inconsistencies which make the law confusing, open to various interpretations and <b>often</b> <b>not</b> followed in practice.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, <b>often</b> <b>not</b> visible {{without the}} use of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E

In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.|$|E
5|$|While the Constitution of Congress Poland was {{relatively}} liberal in theory, {{and gave the}} Sejm significant powers (wider {{than those of the}} Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw), in practice those competences were limited, as they were <b>often</b> <b>not</b> respected by the tsar. Jews and peasants lost rights they had previously enjoyed under the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|A bulker's voyages are {{determined}} by market forces; routes and cargoes often vary. A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route.

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years is <b>often</b> <b>not</b> viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favoritesâ€”though <b>often</b> <b>not</b> Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
