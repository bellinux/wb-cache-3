5|$|An outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> the {{parasitic}} {{life style}} has been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata {{and were the}} first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E

According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar and Narayanboth {{of which are}} modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their {{religion}} {{and each of them}} wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.|$|E
5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that this {{agreement}} marked a victory for Penda, ceding to him Cirencester and the areas along the lower River Severn. These lands to the southwest of Mercia had apparently been taken by the West Saxons from the Britons in 577, and the territory eventually {{became part of the}} subkingdom of the Hwicce. Given Penda's role in the area at this time and his apparent success there, {{it has been argued that}} the subkingdom of the Hwicce was established by him; evidence to support this is lacking, although the subkingdom is known to have existed later in the century. Bassett ("In search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> Anglo-Saxon kingdoms", page 67) is more cautious, noting the lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> {{the recent}} {{conflict}} {{in what is}} now the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which then led to the Great Lakes refugee crisis. Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in Goma in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan Hutu fighters, who were eventually organised into the Rassemblement Démocratique pour le Rwanda, who launched repeated attacks into Rwanda. Rwanda eventually backed Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his quickly organised Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on Rwanda in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by Rwanda, the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing the overthrow of Mobutu in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall was {{a son of}} Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll (died 1164) and his wife, Ragnhildr, {{daughter}} of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. Somairle and Ragnhildr had at least three sons: Dubgall (died after 1175), Ragnall, Áengus (died 1210), and probably also a fourth, Amlaíb. Dubgall {{appears to have been}} the couple's eldest son. Little is certain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> Ragnall's father, although his marriage suggests that he belonged to a family of some substance. In {{the first half of the}} twelfth century, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann) were encompassed within the Kingdom of the Isles, which was ruled by Somairle's father-in-law, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Somairle's rise to power may well have begun at about this time, as the few surviving sources from the era suggest that Argyll may have begun to slip from the control of David I, King of Scots (died 1153).|$|E

5|$|Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> the position, Ellison was {{instrumental}} in promoting its adoption throughout New Zealand. Although {{it is unclear whether}} the wing-forward was used during the 1893 tour of Australia, {{by the time of the}} All Blacks' first Test match, played during their 1903 Australian tour, the position was engrained within the New Zealand style of play. The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of off-side obstruction of the opposition half-back. According to Ellison however, if the position was implemented properly, then there would be no cause for complaint. The wing-forward continued as a vital component of New Zealand rugby until long-standing complaints from the unions of the Home Nations resulted in the position being outlawed by the International Rugby Football Board in 1932.|$|E

Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E

5|$|Æthelstan {{became the}} first king of all the Anglo-Saxon peoples, and in effect {{overlord}} of Britain. His successes inaugurated what John Maddicott, in his history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> the English Parliament, calls the imperial phase of English kingship between about 925 and 975, when rulers from Wales and Scotland attended the assemblies of English kings and witnessed their charters. Æthelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of Northumbria to his rule. He lavished gifts on the minsters of Beverley, Chester-le-Street, and York, emphasising his Christianity. He also purchased the vast territory of Amounderness in Lancashire, {{and gave it to}} the Archbishop of York, his most important lieutenant in the region. But he remained a resented outsider, and the northern British kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan Norse of Dublin. In contrast to his strong control over southern Britain, his position in the north was far more tenuous.|$|E
