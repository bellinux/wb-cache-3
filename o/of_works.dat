5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office <b>of</b> <b>Works.</b> When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{starts from}} {{the premise that}} {{economics}} has offered a one-sided conception <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Standard economic theory, specifically, has defined work {{as a means to}} income and consumption; it has failed to grasp the importance <b>of</b> <b>work</b> as an end in its own right. The aim of the paper is to develop an alternative conception <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that captures the formative impacts <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on the well-being of workers. The paper firstly outlines and criticises the different definitions of the disutility <b>of</b> <b>work</b> found in economics. It then offers a critical assessment of happiness research on work. The idea that the effects <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on worker well-being can be captured by job satisfaction data and that the importance <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can be reduced to a subjective feeling in the heads of individual workers - two key aspects of happiness research - are challenged. The final part of the paper develops novel ideas about how the economics <b>of</b> <b>work</b> should progress in the future. The section proposes a needs-based conception <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and then uses this conception {{to make the case for}} collective intervention aimed at enhancing the quality <b>of</b> <b>work</b> life...|$|R

We will pursue how the work is reflected in debates on basic income, and seek other arguments for universal basic income through a new rethinking <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> To be able to thematize the new rethinking <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> however, the politicization <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is required. In our work, we {{will focus on}} the history of basic income, its normative justification and essential characteristics. We will address basic income and the financial crisis. We will also show how the work has been thematized in the society since its "modern" discovery in the 18 th century. With Dominique Méda, we will describe three images of work: the Smithian concept <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> the images <b>of</b> <b>work</b> associated with the thinking of Karl Marx, and the image <b>of</b> <b>work</b> connected with the origin of the welfare state.

METHODS - The associative research approach became the focus paradigm in this study. Quota sampling used as sampling technique and obtained a sample of 150 nurses of government hospitals. Meanwhile, the data analysis technique used in this research is path analysis. FINDINGS - This study yields several conclusions, among others: the influence <b>of</b> <b>work</b> ethic on communication is positive and significant; the influence <b>of</b> <b>work</b> ethic on work quality is positive but not significant. The influence of communication on the quality <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is positive and significant.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} origins and {{evolution}} {{of the concept of}} the disutility <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The original formulation of this concept developed by Stanley Jevons and by Alfred Marshall recognizes the variability <b>of</b> <b>work</b> motives stressing the effects of both the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on labor supply. Subsequent writers, notably Lionel Robbins, and later Gary Becker, focus on the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>work</b> time, to the neglect of the content <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> These writers lose sight of the influence of the nature <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on the supply of labor. Contemporary research on the economics of labor supply, while accepting the presence of agency problems surrounding the enforcement of the labor contract, continues to consign the determinants <b>of</b> <b>work</b> motives to a black box. The new emphasis on the problem of “shirking” by workers, in particular, offers an unbalanced treatment of the causes and consequences <b>of</b> <b>work</b> resistance. labor supply, effort, shirking, work motivation, work avoidance,...|$|R
