5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E
5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} of Galveston was a booming {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E

At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, the Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea acufera, later {{identified as}} a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown. I.anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon (Isopogon anethifolius) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to {{the natural order of}} Proteeae. Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown's.

40|$|In the Dutch {{coastal waters}} {{more and more}} wind {{turbines}} on monopile foundations are built. An important design parameter is <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency of <b>the</b> wind turbine. <b>The</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency is dependent on environmental conditions and different soil conditions such as scour. This research gives a better insight into the sensitivities of these influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequencies. <b>The</b> first objective {{was to determine the}} sensitivity of different influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequencies in a full scale test environment. <b>The</b> first <b>natural</b> frequencies of four wind turbines (two protected against scour and two not protected against scour) in the Eneco Luchterduinen wind farm are constantly monitored and <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> frequencies are identified. It was found that only the water level has an identifiable influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> identified first <b>natural</b> frequency and that <b>the</b> design <b>natural</b> frequencies and identified natural frequencies differ significantly. After the analysis from the full scale test different influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency in a numerical computer model are investigated. The computer model predictions confirm that the water level has an identifiable effect and only small effects of backfilling of <b>the</b> scour hole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency are found. The third objective was to compare the sensitivity of different influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency obtained from the computer model and from the full scale test. The effects of the water level are comparable. And the effect of backfill of the scour hole was found in the model but not in the full scale test. Therefore no conclusion is made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effect of backfill nor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence of backfill. It was found that in order to mitigate the differences in first <b>natural</b> frequency of <b>the</b> test turbines and the model the soil should be modelled twenty times stiffer. <b>The</b> main influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> frequency of <b>the</b> offshore wind turbines in the Eneco Luchterduinen wind farm is the soil stiffness. The only other identifiable influence was the water level. Also {{in the design of the}} wind turbine the soil stiffness is underestimated significantly, implying overconservative designs.

5|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} {{considered as a}} recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities – the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> landscape increased the frequency of human–animal conflicts.

5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted {{to the analysis of}} wind effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> and built environment.

Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics and a number of specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E

5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E
