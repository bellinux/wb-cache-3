5|$|A vastly {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that {{the primary cause of}} economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy is {{a science}} fiction and fantasy media {{franchise}} created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and developed and owned by Square Enix (formerly Square). The franchise centers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> fantasy and science fantasy role-playing video games (RPGs). The eponymous first game in the series, published in 1987, was conceived by Sakaguchi as his last-ditch effort in the game industry; the title was a success and spawned sequels. The video game series has since branched into other genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm. The franchise has also branched out into other media, including CGI films, anime, manga, and novels.|$|E
5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to the Ottoman Empire, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|Goodwin {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} in 1992 that Styracosaurus {{was part of}} the lineage leading to Einiosaurus, Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus.

The position of Styracosaurus in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent Styracosaurus have been transferred to the genus Rubeosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, {{but he came}} to the producers' attention for his directing work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> party-themed Adidas commercials.

Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E
