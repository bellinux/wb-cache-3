The song characterizes Plankton as a confused faultfinder {{who would be}} much happier if he stopped focusing on his failures and complaining to Karen. Plankton sings a track on the novelty album The Best Day Ever titled [...] "You Will Obey," [...] on which Elvis Presley's former guitarist James Burton played guitar. Of the album, Tom Kenny said [...] "one of <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> Easter eggs that hopefully more than three {{people in the world}} will get is during the guitar solo when Plankton says 'Take it, James', which was what Elvis said in every one of those concert movies". Film composer John Debney produced Plankton's theme music for the second SpongeBob movie, using low brass and trombones. The film's [...] includes several tracks named after Plankton, including [...] "Plankton Rescues Karen," [...] which is used during a scene highlighting Plankton's cooperation with hero SpongeBob.|$|E

60|$|His sudden {{appearance}} daunted, I suppose, <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> enemies; for Northmour and I {{had time}} to recover, to seize Clara between us, one by each arm, and to rush forth to his assistance, ere anything further had taken place. But scarce had we passed the threshold when there came near a dozen reports and flashes from every direction among the hollows of the links. Mr. Huddlestone staggered, uttered a weird and freezing cry, threw up {{his arms over his}} head, and fell backward on the turf.|$|E
60|$|What {{follows from}} the admission? It {{establishes}} no new truth, it gives us no additional insight into <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> nature, neither its action nor itself. Philosophy, impatient {{as it may be}} to build, has much work yet remaining, as pioneer for the overgrowth of ages. It makes one step towards this object; it destroys error, and the roots of error. It leaves, what it is too often the duty of the reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy. It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted, but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own creation. By signs, I would be understood in a wide sense, including what is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In this latter sense, almost all familiar objects are signs, standing, not for themselves, but for others, in their capacity of suggesting one thought which shall lead to a train of thoughts. Our whole life is thus an education of error.|$|E

It's been a long, hard drill for you, Worry, but we're in the stretch now and going to finish fast. We've been a kind of misfit team all spring. You've had a blind faith that {{something}} could be made out of us. Homans has waked up to <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> strength. And I go further than that. I've played ball for years. I know the game. I held down left field for two seasons on the greatest college team ever developed out West. That's new to you. Well, it gives me license to talk a little. I {{want to tell you that}} I can feel what's in this team. It's like the feeling I have when I'm running against a fast man in the sprints. From now on we'll be a family of brothers with one idea. And that'll be to play Place off their feet." ...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in 1939 Jean Lucey Pratt kept a diary for Mass-Observation, a British {{research}} organization that enlisted volunteers {{to write about}} their lives. Her Mass-Observation diaries, which had been archived at the University of Sussex, were featured in three books edited by Simon Garfield. <b>Our</b> <b>Hidden</b> Lives, published in 2005, covered the postwar period up to 1948, while We Are at War (2006) and Private Battles (2007) drew on wartime diaries. Pratt, to whom Garfield gave the pseudonym [...] "Maggie Joy Blunt", was the only diarist to appear in all three books. [...] He described her as [...] "a lyrical and talented writer in her mid-thirties living in a cottage by Burnham Beeches, near Slough". [...] <b>Our</b> <b>Hidden</b> Lives was adapted into a 2005 television film for BBC Four by David Eldridge with Sarah Parish playing the Maggie Joy Blunt character.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{most recent}} {{exhibitions}} {{have been at}} the P.P.O.W. Gallery in New York City. What Would Mother Say (2009) featured children engaging in actions which, while innocent, may be construed by adults as provocative or shameful; each work is accompanied by two panels of text. More recently, The Lone Ranger (2013) served as a follow up to What Would Mother Say and included a photo of a boy kissing a horse. According to Attie, that little boy grew up to be the Lone Ranger. Attie expresses that “All of my (her) work is about <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> selves, the part of us we don’t want to share with others”, and this was her inspiration for “The Lone Ranger”. The overarching idea of the show is that [...] "If a little boy does something, he will {{grow up to be a}} hero. But the little girls, doing the same thing, they all become whores." [...] Attie expresses that “All of my (her) work is about <b>our</b> <b>hidden</b> selves, the part of us we don’t want to share with others”, and this was her inspiration for “The Lone Ranger”. In 2013 she was working on a series of painting called the “Worst Case Scenarios”.|$|E

The book received favorable reviews in several journals and other media, including The Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association (Nr. 7-8 April 2014). The true nature of such phenomena are disputed, whether {{they are to be}} understood as being objective (physical) or merely subjective (psychological), but in parapsychology they are often seen as expressions of unexplained powers of the human mind.|$|E
