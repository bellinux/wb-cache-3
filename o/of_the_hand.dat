40|$|Introduction: Cartilaginous tumors {{involving}} <b>the</b> small bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> {{and feet}} are usually benign such as enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma. <b>The</b> small bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet are rarely involved by primary chondrosarcoma. Proximal phalanges {{are the most}} common sites in <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> but <b>the</b> fourth digit is the least common site. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 76 -year-old Greek female who presented to our hospital with a painful swollen mass measuring 4. 5 × 2. 6 cm on <b>the</b> fourth digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>hand.</b> <b>The</b> radiograph showed a destructive, permeative lytic tumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal phalanx with extension into soft tissue. The patient underwent curettage, and <b>the</b> microscopic examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimen revealed grade 2 chondrosarcoma. Conclusion: Cartilaginous tumors involving <b>the</b> small bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet are usually benign such as enchondroma, chondromyxoid fibroma and chondroblastoma. Primary chondrosarcoma is the third most common malignancy of bone after myeloma and osteosarcoma, but <b>the</b> small bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet are very rarely involved by chondrosarcoma (1 % of all chondrosarcoma). However, in these cases differentiation between a benign lesion and chondrosarcoma may be difficult. Occasionally chondrosarcoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet is associated with multiple recurrences or distal metastasis...|$|R

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hand</b> and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|The {{hands and}} forearms of Triceratops {{retained}} a fairly primitive structure {{compared to other}} quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward ("pronated") as the animals walked. Triceratops, like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods, walked with most of their fingers pointing out {{and away from the}} body, the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods. In Triceratops, the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> at rest which disappears during voluntary {{movement of the}} affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
5|$|Theropods, {{including}} spinosaurids, {{could not}} pronate their hands (rotate the forearm so the palm faced the ground), but a resting {{position on the}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> was possible, as shown by fossil prints from an Early Jurassic theropod. A 2014 paper describing new material of Spinosaurus, proposed that its legs were too short for it to move effectively on land. The reconstruction {{used in the study}} was an extrapolation based on different sized individuals, scaled to what was assumed to be the correct proportions. Palaeontologist John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College of the University of London has expressed scepticism to the new reconstruction, and cautioned that using different specimens can result in inaccurate chimaeras. Scott Hartman also expressed criticism because he believed the legs and the pelvis were inaccurately scaled (27% too short) and didn't match the published lengths. However, responses from Ibrahim et al. to Mark Witton have been positively received as reliable. The 2015 re-description of Sigilmassasaurus Evers et al. 2015 doubted whether the material assigned to Spinosaurus by Ibrahim et. al. belonged to it.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped {{necks and}} long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% {{the length of}} the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs {{strongly}} reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter {{the length of the}} femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. As in most coelurosaurs, the second digit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> is the largest, even when the third digit is not present.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} on cooperative bimanual action. Right-handed subjects manipulated {{a pair of}} physical objects, a tool and a target object, so that the tool would touch a target on the object (fig. 1).

This suggests that <b>the</b> right <b>hand</b> operates relative to <b>the</b> frame-of-reference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>hand.</b> Furthermore, when physical constraints guide the tool placement, this fundamentally changes <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> motor control required. The task is tremendously simplified for both hands, and reversing roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> {{is no longer an}} important factor. Thus, specialization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> is significant only for skilled manipulation...|$|R
