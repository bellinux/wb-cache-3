5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{retained}} his lead in the Drivers' Championship, although Hamilton closed the gap to eleven points. The two Ferrari drivers of Vettel and Räikkönen followed in third and fourth, both on 96 points, followed by Ricciardo in fifth with 88. In the constructors' standings, Mercedes increased their lead over Ferrari now on 295 to 192 points. Red Bull were third, with 168 points, 76 points ahead <b>of</b> <b>Williams.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} weekend, Mercedes had already secured the Constructors' Championship, having done {{so at the}} {{previous}} race in Russia. Ferrari was in second place on 359 points, 139 points ahead <b>of</b> <b>Williams.</b> In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 ahead of his teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton {{would be able to}} win the title with three races to spare, as long as he gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen's victory {{promoted}} {{him into}} {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship {{for the first time in}} the 2000 season, two points ahead of Michael Schumacher and six ahead of Coulthard. Häkkinen and Coulthard's strong finishes promoted McLaren into the lead of the Constructors' Championship, one point ahead of Ferrari and 88 ahead <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> with five races of the season remaining.|$|E

5|$|Novlene Williams {{participated in}} the second heat of the August 17 {{semifinal}} round, competing against seven other athletes.

5|$|Soon after, Carter {{created a}} special White House {{task force to}} {{investigate}} the claims. Carter named retiring judge William B.

5|$|Ultimately, Poniatowski owed {{his career}} to his family {{connections}} with the powerful Czartoryski family and their political faction, known as Familia, to whom he grew closer.

5|$|Washington {{thought so}} highly <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> that in 1792, when Daniel Morgan refused {{the rank of}} Brigadier General of the American Army, the {{president}} had Henry Knox, the United States Secretary of War, write Williams asking him to accept the position. The position would have made Williams the second {{in command of the}} American Army, but citing poor health and no ambition for the position, Williams declined the appointment. However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello's {{victory was}} {{considered}} popular amongst the Formula One paddock {{as it came}} after a setback during his career. The race result meant Häkkinen and Coulthard were tied for second place but the points advantage to Michael Schumacher was reduced to two points. Barrichello remained a further eight points behind the McLaren drivers. In the Constructors' Championship McLaren remained four points behind the Ferraris, who were 80 points ahead <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> with six races of the season remaining. The track intruder, named as 47-year-old Frenchman Robert Sehli, later apologised for his actions and was fined by the track's management.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1949, {{the average}} {{size of the}} design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National Research Development Corporation. In July 1949, IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company {{subsequently}} licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, {{in the design of}} its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names <b>of</b> <b>Williams,</b> Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law in the case <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> v. Blair {{on the basis that}} it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
50|$|With {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>William</b> III, Prince <b>of</b> Orange, the {{legitimate}} male line <b>of</b> <b>William</b> the Silent (the second House of Orange) became extinct.

5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' {{first attempt}} at {{developing}} a new video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional in the cases <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E

5|$|Forced {{to choose}} between {{accepting}} depreciated money in payment for outstanding debts or waiting long times to collect debts, creditors turned to the courts for relief. In 1822, Bourbon County circuit court judge James Clark ruled in the case <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> v. Blair that the replevin law violated {{the state and federal}} constitutions. This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that they attempted to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole position, but was {{overtaken}} by Rosberg {{at the first}} corner. Rosberg held the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race, barring brief periods during pit stops, and won by over three seconds. Hamilton remained ahead <b>of</b> <b>Williams</b> driver Felipe Massa to claim the runner-up position. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had been holding third position for much of the first half of the race, but a delay due to a stuck wheel nut during his pit stop dropped him into fourth place. Former World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso were eliminated on the first lap, after Räikkönen lost control of his Ferrari at the second turn and collided with Alonso. The two came to rest against the safety barrier, with Alonso's McLaren atop the Ferrari.|$|E
