40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} a mapping project and grant program funded by NHEP and administered by DES. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NHEP and DES provided funding to map <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> {{in the coastal}} area and created a grant program to provide assistance to coastal communities to develop storm sewer infrastructure maps. As part of the mapping project, DES collected global positioning system (GPS) readings of all <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> in New Castle, Newington, Portsmouth, and parts of Durham and Madbury. For the grant project, DES issued a request for proposals (RFP), chose grant recipients, and managed the contracts. This report provides details on the grant projects completed by Exeter, Hampton, Newmarket, Seabrook, and Somersworth. The two grant projects that were terminated, Durham and Rochester, will not be discussed. The deadline for completion of all grant projects was June 30, 2003...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} features of the site is an area known as 'the patch' or, by anglers, as 'the boil'.

40|$|International audienceWater {{samples from}} streams, brooks and storm sewer <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> that collect storm waters across the Island of Montréal were {{analyzed}} for caffeine, carbamazepine and fecal coliforms. All samples contained various concentrations of these tracers, indicating a widespread sanitary contamination in urban environments. Fecal coliforms and caffeine levels ranged over several {{orders of magnitude}} with a modest correlation between caffeine and fecal coliforms (R 2 value of 0. 558). An arbitrary threshold of 400 ng caffeine L− 1 allows us to identify samples with an elevated fecal contamination, as defined by more than 200 colony-forming units per 100 mL (cfu 100 mL− 1) of fecal coliforms. Low caffeine levels were sporadically related to high fecal coliform counts. Lower levels of caffeine and fecal coliforms were observed in the brooks while the larger streams and storm water discharge points contained over ten times more. The carbamazepine data showed little or no apparent correlation to caffeine. These data suggest that this storm water collection system, located in a highly urbanized urban environment, is widely contaminated by domestic sewers {{as indicated by the}} ubiquitous presence of fecal contaminants as well as caffeine and carbamazepine. Caffeine concentrations were relatively well correlated to fecal coliforms, and could potentially be used as a chemical indicator of the level of contamination by sanitary sources. The carbamazepine data was not significantly correlated to fecal coliforms and of little use in this dataset...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} several studies on marine {{bacterial}} indicators {{and their relationship}} to shellfish are compared to assess the sources of pathogenic enteric viruses found in the shellfish and the overlying waters. The main source of pathogens to coastal waters was found to be input from urban runoff but also from sewage <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes,</b> septic tank leakage, and from more diffuse sources like livestock farms and animal waste products. Bacteria and enteric viruses such as E. coli, Shigella, hepatitis A virus, andNorwalk virus, are able to persist in the environment and are typically found in much higher concentrations in the flesh of shellfish. Bivalve shellfish will feed by filtering their food items out of water where they live. In conditions where the marine environment is unspoiled, shellfish are a reasonable safe food source. In waters where contaminants are found, pollutants can be concentrated in the tissue of the mollusks making them not fit for human consumption. Bacterial diseases associated with eating shellfish from polluted nearshore waters have been documented for over 100 years. To ensure the quality and health of the Atlantic coastal waters, it is important to monitor pathogen input from streams, estuaries and urban runoff so that risk is minimized and there is no economic interruption in the business associated with the harvest of shellfish. Although the term “shellfish” can apply to most crustaceans, for the applications in this paper, the term will apply only to bivalve mollusks such as scallops, clams, oysters and mussels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> {{into the}} ocean are {{analogous}} to chimneys in the atmosphere: they are each intended for returning contaminated fluids to the environment {{in a way that}} promotes adequate transport and dispersion of the waste fluids. A waste-water treatment plant and an adjoining outfall constitute a system for environmental control; it is practically never feasible to provide such complete treatment that an outfall is not necessary, nor is it common to depend entirely on an outfall with no treatment. Although outfalls and chimneys are functionally similar, there are important differences in their relationships to the coastal waters and atmosphere respectively. Urban and industrial areas, generating waste water, are located along the shallow edge of the ocean, with often tens or even hundreds of kilometers of continental shelf between the shoreline and the deep ocean. The bottom slope on the shelf is typically less than one percent. Thus outfalls extending several kilometers offshore discharge into a body of water of large lateral extent compared to the depth, and are still remote from the main body of ocean water. In contrast, most atmospheric contaminants are introduced {{at the base of the}} atmosphere and circulate throughout the whole atmosphere much more readily. Vertical convection mixes the troposphere rapidly in most places and the wind systems circulate the air around the globe in a matter of weeks. Outfalls and chimneys are useful in reducing pollutant concentrations only locally. Far away from the sources, it makes little difference how the pollutants are discharged. The decay times of the pollutants are important in the choice of effective discharge strategies. For example, the problems of very persistent contaminants such as DDT cannot be alleviated by dispersion from an outfall; such pollutants must be intercepted at the source and prevented from entering the environment. On the other hand, degradable organic wastes, as in domestic sewage, may be effectively disposed of through a good ocean outfall. Since the decay time is only a few days, potential problems are only local, and not regional or global...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the rate of organic matter degradation within the sediments adjacent to the Whites Point Los Angeles County sewage outfall system on the San Pedro Shelf. Benthic chamber deployments were made at three stations in a transect away from the <b>outfall</b> <b>pipe</b> during three cruise periods (October 1990, February and October 1991). The fluxes of phosphate, silicate and radon- 222 showed the most significant difference (factor of 3) between stations proximal and distal to the sewage effluent outfall pipe; the fluxes of nitrate, ammonia, alkalinity and TCO 2 showed some gradient (a factor of 1. 5 – 2) and the uptake of oxygen showed no variability between sites. Carbon oxidation in these sediments is driven primarily by net oxygen consumption and secondarily by net sulfate reduction. Net sulfate reduction accounts for about 30 % of the carbon oxidation near the <b>outfall</b> <b>pipe</b> and 10 – 15 % at the distal sites. Measurements of radon- 222 fluxes and radon emanation rates from sediments indicate that the intensity of bio-irrigation is greater by a factor of 2 at sites away from the <b>outfall</b> <b>pipe,</b> but also shows that bio-irrigation does take place at the site adjacent to the pipe. The total amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) oxidized in the sediments around the outfall is B 2 107 g C/d. An estimate of carbon burial in this region is 4 107 g C/d. The outfall system could supply B 3 107 g C/d of which 12 – 20 % is estimated to have been deposited in the region. Hence, effluent-derived POC, although it may {{be a part of the}} total organic carbon pool undergoing diagenesis and burial on the sea floor, i...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{societal}} {{pressures on}} the U. S. continental shelves adjacent to dense population centers have brought to light the lack of accurate base maps in these areas. Existing bathymetric maps and random sidescan sonar surveys are either not accurate enough or do not provide the coverage necessary to make policy decisions. Until the mid 1990 s, it was not financially prudent nor technically efficient to map the shallow shelves. However, the availability of high-resolution multibeam mapping systems now allow efficient and accurate mapping of the continental margins. In 1996 the U. S. Geological Survey began a large-scale seafloor mapping campaign on the continental shelf and slope adjacent to Los Angeles, CA. The first survey used a Kongsberg Simrad EM 1000 (95 kHz). The survey continued in 1998 by mapping the slope and proximal basins from Newport to Long Beach, CA, using a Kongsberg Simrad EM 300 (30 kHz). The area was completed in May 1999 by mapping the entire shelf adjacent to Long Beach, CA using an EM 3000 D (a dual-headed 300 -kHz system). The mapping used both INS from the vehicle motion sensor and DGPS to provide position accuracies of 1 m. All the data were processed {{in the field in}} near realtime using software developed at the Univ. of New Brunswick. Because of the different systems used and the range of water depths, the spatial resolution of the processed data varies from 3 ̆c 0. 5 m on the inner shelf to 8 m on the basin floors. Perspective overviews of backscatter draped over bathymetry reveals a host of geological features unknown to exist in this area. These features include shallow, linear gullys, barchan dunes, small-scale bedforms in shallow troughs, major canyon system complexes, large- and smallscale mass movements, faults, and large areas of outcrop. The effects on sediment transport of man-made features, such as sewer <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> and dredge-disposal fields, are clearly delineated on the new maps.

40|$|This {{presentation}} was prepared as {{an overview of}} a six-month {{study conducted by the}} eighth-grade Girls’ Environmental Group at Atlantic Middle School in North Quincy. Due to lack of additional staff and large numbers of students, this smaller group of 15 girls was formed as an after school group which also sometimes met on Saturdays for the purpose of sampling. The girls decided that their goal for the group was to learn how to monitor a specific environmental site, and to learn more about their own neighborhood. This included acquiring an understanding of history of the area, both in terms of natural history and human land use. The girls also wanted to learn how to take water samples, and how to analyze them for water quality. Our study got a late start due to the difficulties in finding a safe and feasible site in an urban area. Because of transportation and staff restrictions, we needed a site that was within walking distance. We also had to consider physical safety, since most sampling would need to be done late in the day. Additionally, parents and administrators had legitimate concerns about chemical pollution and dangerous debris such as car parts, bridge remnants, and other potential hazards. The increasing coyote population was a concern, as packs of coyotes have been following walkers. And the logistics of the sampling site was a concern, as we needed a spot that was not difficult to dangerous to access. With the help of Dr. Curry, we eventually chose a spot along Commander Shea Blvd. on the river side of Marina Bay. Though we used the best possible site for access, we still experienced difficulties with sampling. This was mostly due to the mud flats and low tide, and the slippery nature of the <b>outfall</b> <b>pipes</b> from which we sampled. Prolonged winter weather did not make our efforts any easier. Therefore, grab samples proved to be the most feasible option for water quality testing. We used LaMotte test kits and additional nutrient analysis provided by WAL equipment to collect our results. We also spent time making observations around our site. Most notable was what we saw in terms of physical pollution and abandoned structures, and what we did not see in terms of cleanliness and wildlife. Overall, our testing was inconclusive. But our observations clearly indicated that our site was in poor health...|$|R
