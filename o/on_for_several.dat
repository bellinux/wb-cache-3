5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} off and <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A {{few years after}} their wedding, Poe {{was involved in a}} substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had been working <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> years was to determine if there was any correlation between water depth and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E
5|$|Route434 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route739 and Pike County Quadrant Route4004 in Lords Valley, {{a community in}} Blooming Grove Township. Route434 heads to the northeast, passing businesses and homes before leaving the community. The highway then gets into a more scenic rural region, with trees surrounding the highway. Route434, which makes several curves {{for the next few}} miles, passes to the south of a lake. The highway continues <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> miles in this way. A short time later, the highway passes a couple homes and crosses Shohola Creek. Just north of the creek, the area becomes somewhat urbanized with homes beginning to surround the road again. However, this does not last long, with forests returning once more. Just north of the community, Route434 intersects U.S. Route6.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E

25|$|The Quebec {{public sector}} teachers' unions oppose {{any form of}} subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the {{brightest}} and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties; and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with {{the main body of}} Quebec public sector teachers' unions.

He played one further first-class match, against Hampshire in May 1923, aged 49, but made just 0 and 5 as Worcestershire slipped to a two-day innings defeat.|$|E

25|$|Although {{in-house}} production had ceased, the BBC were hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch {{the show and}} had been approached for such a venture as early as July 1989 (while the 26th series was still in production) by Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States. Segal's negotiations dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>several</b> years, and followed him from Columbia to Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company and finally to Universal Studios' television arm. At Amblin, Segal had come close to interesting the CBS network in commissioning the series as a mid-season replacement show in 1994, but this eventually came to nothing.|$|E
