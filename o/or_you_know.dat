500|$|X Japan are {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan [...] "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock". In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying [...] "when we started the band, the problem was we didn’t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn’t belong anywhere", [...] " [...] that eventually became visual kei." [...] He added [...] "But visual kei is more like a spirit, it’s not a music style <b>or,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know...</b> I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s what I believe visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it.

So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help.

2500|$|The Tennis Masters Cup singles final {{featured}} ATP No. 3, Australian Open, Indian Wells and Rome champion Novak Djokovic, and Miami Masters, Pörtschach and Warsaw winner Nikolay Davydenko, in both men's first year-end championships final. The encounter was {{the third}} match of the two, after a Davis Cup rubber won by Davydenko after Djokovic retired, leading two sets to one, and their round robin meeting on day 3, in which Djokovic prevailed 7–6, 0–6, 7–5. Djokovic started the encounter on serve, and took {{the advantage of a}} weak Davydenko service game (the Russian went on to win only 42% of his service points in the set) to break and lead 2–0. A nervous Davydenko failed again to keep his serve at 3–0, and was broken again by the Serb. The Russian managed to save his service game at 5–0, forcing Djokovic to serve for the set. The Serb did not falter, and clinched the set 6–1. Despite holding his first service game, Davydenko was broken again at 1–1 in the second set. Davydenko avoided another break of serve when led 1–3, but was unable to gain the advantage on Djokovic's serve until the Serb served for the match at 5–4. Davydenko then increased his level of play, and came back to 5-all, but Djokovic, keeping his momentum of the match, broke once more, and held to serve to claim victory, after one hour and forty-two minutes, on the final score of 6–1, 7–5. The win marked Djokovic's fourth title of the year (after a six months title drought since Rome, won on May 11) and his eleventh overall, as well as his first year-end championships crown. Djokovic became the first Serbian player to win the singles championships (Nenad Zimonjić had become the first Serbian to win the doubles championships just hours before – and all three men, Djokovic, Zimonjić and Nestor were born in Belgrade), succeeding to two-time defending champion Roger Federer, and, thanks to the win, and Federer's early loss, finished the year only two points behind the Swiss in the ATP Race. Djokovic commented on his win : [...] "I would put it in the same league as a Grand Slam because the best eight players in the world are participating here. [...] I feel very happy. End up the season the way I started it, with a win in a big event. So it's a great boost up for upcoming season." [...] On the possibility of going up in the rankings in the 2009 ATP World Tour season, Djokovic admitted again his goal to become World No. 1 : [...] "Certainly, I believe that I have quality to reach the top spot in the upcoming year <b>or,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> whatever, next couple of years, 10 years [...] That is my lifetime goal that I’ve been always trying to achieve." ...|$|E
