40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Rationale: Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung {{infection}} is common and associated with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in cystic fibrosis. Whether recent advances in care have affected the frequency <b>of</b> this <b>chronic</b> {{infection is}} unknown. Objectives: Determine {{if there was a}} significant change in the incidence <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection among adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis between 2003 and 2012. Methods: The retrospective cohort consisted of individuals with cystic fibrosis followed in the CF Foundation Patient Registry who were 13 years of age and older without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa at baseline. Multivariable regression models accounting for within patient correlation were used to assess the change in incidence <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection between 2003 and 2012. Measurements and Main Results: During the ten-year observation period, 15, 504 individuals were followed for a median of 5 (IQR 2 - 9) years. The incidence <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 14. 3 % in 2003 to 6. 4 % in 2012. After adjusting for potential confounding, there was a significant decrease in the relative risk <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection compared to 2003 (P value test of trend < 0. 001). Relative to 2003, the risk <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in 2012 was 0. 33 (95 % CI: 0. 30 - 0. 37). Conclusions: Among individuals with cystic fibrosis, a significant decrease in the incidence <b>of</b> developing <b>chronic</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection between 2003 and 2012 was observed. Whether this change in incidence results in changes in clinical outcomes warrants further exploration...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>chronic</b> HBV infection {{in a given}} area. In low prevalence {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate prevalence areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa, transmission during childhood is a significant factor. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>chronic</b> HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8% with 10–15% prevalence in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively. According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600,000 people die every year related to the infection.|$|E
