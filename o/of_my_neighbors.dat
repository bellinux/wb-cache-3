500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E
500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School down! I can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys. Something worse than vouchers could come along. If it works, if it sacrifices the entire school system, fine! Get rid of the damn thing! It hasn't worked!" [...] His suggestion caused uproar in the community, and his remarks were heavily criticized. Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Sévérine's death sequence was primarily negative. Dunt criticized Bond's comment following Sévérine's death - [...] "Waste of good Whiskey" [...] - as [...] "brutish and uncaring". Jade Budowski of The Tribeca Film Institute described {{the scene as}} [...] "unpalatable", and wrote that she [...] "sense it in the shifting of some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the theater," [...] specifically after the delivery of Bond's line. She argued that the sequence returned to the franchise's earlier treatment of women as [...] "expendable figures" [...] viewing them only as [...] "sex objects, eye candy, and plot devices". Berlatsky argued that Bond's reaction was just a [...] "callous joke" [...] and Sévérine existed {{for the sole purpose}} of [...] "lend weight to Craig's perspicuity, sexiness, and imperviousness". Paste's Kenneth Lowe found Bond's behavior toward women to be negative, citing Sévérine's death as a prominent example.|$|E

2500|$|TO THE PUBLIC: Whereas {{reports have}} been industriously put in {{circulation}} {{that my son}} Alvin {{had been removed from}} the place of his interment and dissected; which reports ... are peculiarly calculated to harrow up the mind of a parent and deeply wound the feelings of relations ... therefore, for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of such reports, I, with some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neighbors</b> this morning, repaired to the grave, and removing the earth, found the body, which had not been disturbed. This method is taken for the purpose of satisfying the minds of those who may have heard the report, and of informing those who have put it in circulation, that it is earnestly requested they would desist therefrom.|$|E
2500|$|Barnum enjoyed what he {{publicly}} dubbed [...] "profitable philanthropy." [...] In Barnum's own words: [...] "I have {{no desire}} to be considered much of a philanthropist...if by improving and beautifying our city Bridgeport, Connecticut, and adding to the pleasure and prosperity <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neighbors,</b> I can do so at a profit, the incentive to 'good works' will be twice as strong as if it were otherwise." [...] In line with this philosophy was Barnum's pursuit of major American museums and spectacles. Less known are Barnum's significant contributions to Tufts University. Barnum was appointed to the Board of Trustees prior to the University's founding and made several significant contributions to the fledgling institution. The most noteworthy example of this was his gift in 1883 of $50,000 ($2,000,000 in 2013), to establish a museum and hall for the Department of Natural History, which today houses the department of biology. Because of the relationship between Barnum and Tufts, Jumbo the elephant became the school's mascot, and Tufts students are known as [...] "Jumbos." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Lindsay's narrative, {{social and}} {{religious}} awakenings {{initiated by the}} citizens and spiritual influences lead to the transformation of Springfield - and more broadly, America - into a [...] "practical City of God."

2500|$|The {{environmental}} journal Ambio {{described the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro, [...] " [...] {{has served as}} a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for satoyama and traditional village life." [...] The film's central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese [...] "Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign" [...] to preserve areas of satoyama in the Saitama Prefecture. The fund, started in 1990 after the film's release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, an English dubbed version, {{produced}} by Magnum Video Tape and Dubbing for international Japan Airlines flights {{at the request}} of Tokuma Shoten, was briefly screened in the United States by Streamline Pictures. Carl Macek, the head of Streamline, was disappointed with this dub, deeming it [...] "adequate, but clumsy". Following this, Tokuma allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. The Streamline dub of Castle in the Sky was released only on the first Japanese DVD release along with the Streamline dub <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Totoro and The Castle of Cagliostro.
