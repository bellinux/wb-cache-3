5000|$|<b>Ozone</b> <b>generators</b> are {{designed}} to produce ozone, and are sometimes sold as whole house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong oxidant gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> is in unoccupied rooms, utilising [...] "shock treatment" [...] commercial <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> that produce over 3000 mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, mold (including toxic molds), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone. However, it is not healthy to breathe ozone gas, and one should use extreme caution when buying a room air purifier that also produces ozone.|$|R

50|$|High Ozone Shock Treatment {{involves}} {{using an}} <b>ozone</b> <b>generator</b> with a timer to create lethal levels of ozone in an odour ridden or mold-affected room or building {{for a short}} period of time, perhaps an hour.

50|$|Certain plants (e.g. most {{strains of}} cannabis) emit a {{distinctive}} odor during their reproductive phase. This presents difficulties {{to those who}} are cultivating in places where it is illegal, or for growers who may prefer discretion for other reasons. The most common way of eliminating odor is by pulling odorous air through a carbon filter. Many cultivators simply attach a large carbon filter to their air extraction system, thereby filtering any smell before the air is expelled from the grow-room. Another way of eliminating odor is by installing an <b>ozone</b> <b>generator</b> in the extraction ducting. The air is forced past the <b>ozone</b> <b>generator</b> by the extraction fan, and the odorous air is neutralized as it mixes with the ozone; however the cultivator must ensure that the air is thoroughly mixed before it is expelled outside, lest some odor escape. Care must be taken to prevent excessive ozone concentrations in the garden itself, or where it might be inhaled by the grower or his/her family. Ozone itself has a distinctive smell and is harmful to living things, although the molecule breaks down quickly (20 minutes to an hour) in atmospheric conditions.|$|E

2500|$|UV <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> use {{ambient air}} for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), {{therefore}} these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> usually produce <b>ozone</b> with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV <b>ozone</b> <b>generators,</b> unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Ionisers are {{distinct}} from <b>ozone</b> <b>generators,</b> although both devices {{operate in a}} similar way. Ionisers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions (for instance N2− or O2−) that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity. Even the best ionisers will also produce {{a small amount of}} ozone—triatomic oxygen, O3—which is unwanted. <b>Ozone</b> <b>generators</b> are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light.|$|R
50|$|In {{ozone water}} disinfection, {{microbes}} are destroyed by ozone gas (O3) provided by an <b>ozone</b> <b>generator.</b> Common in Europe, ozone gas is now becoming widely {{adopted in the}} United States. It is emerging across {{a wide array of}} industries; from municipal water treatment plants, to food processing plants, to healthcare organizations. It is being adopted due to its ability to sanitize water and surfaces without wasting water, and because there are no by-products. When its job is done, ozone gas quickly degrades into oxygen. Ozone is more effective than chlorine in destroying viruses and bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Tertiary {{treatment}} {{is a term}} applied to polishing methods used following a traditional sewage treatment sequence. Tertiary {{treatment is}} being increasingly applied in industrialized countries and most common technologies are micro filtration or synthetic membranes. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is nearly indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its minerals). Nitrates can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but also via microbial denitrification. Ozone wastewater treatment is also growing in popularity, and {{requires the use of}} an <b>ozone</b> <b>generator,</b> which decontaminates the water as ozone bubbles percolate through the tank, but this treatment is energy intensive. Latest, and very promising treatment technology is the use aerobic granulation.|$|E

50|$|Some plants (e.g. cultivars of Cannabis sativa subsp. indica), {{can give}} off strong odors as they grow, {{resulting}} in detection of illegal growing operations. Growers frequently use carbon scrubbers and ventilation to control odors. This typically involves forcing {{air from the}} grow room through a device containing activated carbon, then venting it outdoors. Others use an <b>ozone</b> <b>generator.</b> Ozone reacts with odor molecules in the air, permanently eliminating them. However, ozone can build up to levels that may be hazardous both for grower and plant. As a last resort, keeping windows firmly shut and using strong air fresheners can control smells. Checking outside {{to see if any}} smells are emanating from indoors is often a necessary precaution, as many growers become acclimated to the smell, and fail to realize just how pervasive the odor may be. Many store plants in more isolated areas such as a basement or attic to prevent smell detection. Another less common solution is to simply grow a strain with a weaker odor.|$|E
50|$|Geoff and Tom make up at {{the start}} of Day 13, but Tom {{suddenly}} decides to do things Merv's way. There is another setback, however, as they had mismeasured some of the stairs, wasting some of their valuable metal and time.

Geoff is also concerned about how to fill in the crib walls, as their crushed glass wall seems too heavy (but Geoff is hopeful that the cork, which they have in plentiful supply, {{can be used as a}} substitute). However, they also manage to finish a brick wall from the wall the clients rejected earlier. Meanwhile, Andy and Katrina's kitchen is raising issues from the incomplete appearance, and Geoff ultimately decides to hide it from the clients. When the clients show up for inspection, they show their like of the brick wall, but they're adamant on the glass instead of the corks. They are also sold on the <b>ozone</b> <b>generator</b> in the water purification system, but they are concerned with some of the health issues. Geoff is forced to think hard and consider pulling the plug on some of the projects, as only $560 is left, all of which have already been earmarked for supplies needed by the team.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ozone</b> <b>generators</b> {{are used}} to produce ozone for {{cleaning}} air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O2 will not react. Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m3, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Ozone (03) {{is used as}} a {{steriliser}} of air and water, but {{the nitrogen}} oxides (NOx) are harmful to man and the environment. <b>Ozone</b> <b>generators</b> excite electrons to higher energy levels so that O 3 and NOx can be manufactured from oxygen and nitrogen in the air feed. The factors that influence the NOx production in domestic <b>ozone</b> <b>generators,</b> in particular Sterizone <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> were investigated, so that their design, operation and marketability could be improved. Sterizone <b>ozone</b> <b>generators</b> are designed with an exceptionally fast change in electrical field of 3 x 10 xy 8 V mm- 1 s- 1 with the aim of optimalising ozone production and decreasing NOx production. In this study it was found that Sterizone does produce NOx. After optimalising the analytical methods, the influence of the following reaction conditions on the production of O 3 and NOx by Sterizone was investigated: 1) Feed of synthetic air 2) Water vapour pressure of the feed gas 3) N 2 / 02 ratio of the feed gas 4) Contaminants in the air feed 5) C 02 in the air feed 6) Change in the frequency of the pulses 7) Temperature of the feed gas It was found that the Sterizone unit showed comparable properties with other <b>ozone</b> <b>generators.</b> High temperatures lower the ozone production so that the air feed must remain sufficiently high to prevent overheating which leads to high N 0,/ 03 ratios. The ozone production of Sterizone is dependent {{on the quality of the}} environmental air. Air humidity and contaminants like diesel fuel, ethanol, paraffin and xylene vapours lead to a drastic decrease in O 3 production. Carbon dioxide on the other hand causes a much smaller decrease in ozone production. No reaction conditions were found that led to a significant lowering of NO, production. The determination of nitrogen oxides was problematic and better analytical methods should be developed. It is recommended that an investigation is done into the possibility of removing the nitrogen oxides by means of an external filter or decreasing the product by means of ultraviolet radiation. The development of a more comprehensive theoretical model for the ozone formation processes will be beneficial to the optimalisation of <b>ozone</b> <b>generators.</b> Master...|$|R
