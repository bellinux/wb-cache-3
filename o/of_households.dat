The extended model of the Almost Ideal Demand System is used for empirical estimation.

It is also hypothesized that the study <b>of</b> <b>household</b> consumption behavior should use household data to satisfy the restrictions imposed on this theory. The data used in this study are from the urban households observed in the 1984, 1987, and 1990 National Household Socioeconomic Surveys in the province of Central Java, Indonesia;The results show that the joint effect <b>of</b> <b>household</b> size by age-sex composition, age and education level <b>of</b> the <b>household</b> head, education level of the spouse, housing status <b>of</b> the <b>household,</b> type <b>of</b> <b>household,</b> and main source of income are statistically significant in predicting the parameters <b>of</b> <b>household</b> consumption behavior in the province of Central Java, Indonesia.

Three different zones namely, Low Density (LD), Medium Density (MD) and High Density (HD) were considered,, both close-ended and open-ended questionnaire were administered to 900 households representing 75 % of the total population. Using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16 data were analyzed and binomial logistic regression analysis was used in developing a model which showed that only academic qualification <b>of</b> <b>household</b> head, number <b>of</b> <b>household</b> members and average monthly income <b>of</b> <b>household</b> significantly influences motorcycle ownership across the zones at the 95 % confidence level.

The figures on <b>household</b> production <b>of</b> Finland and Germany {{provided by the}} particular Household Satellite Account Systems indicate a higher value <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production for Finland. The total output <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production amounts to 15 705 per capita. The German value ranges below the Finnish figure and amounts to only 13 438 per capita. Though, {{the analysis of the}} particular satellite account systems revealed differences in the underlying valuation concepts in both countries. The indicated values in the <b>Household</b> Satellite Accounts <b>of</b> Finland and Germany are consequently incommensurable. Within a recalculation of the values <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production, comparable results of both countries are generated. For this purpose a new and consistent valuation concept is defined. The defined concept thereby facilitates the presentation <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production in relation to market production. The resulting values of the recalculation present a conversely ratio of the Finnish and German value on household production compared to the original results. After the alignment of the calculation methods in the recalculation, Germany features the higher value <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production. Its value increased within the valuation process and ranges above the Finnish value. The recalculated total output in Germany accounts for 15 694 per capita. The Finnish value by contrast decreased and amounts to only 14 633 per capita. Hence, the modifications, introduced to the valuation concept in terms of the calculation of comparable results, caused changes in the values <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production in Finland and Germany. When household production is related to market production the values of Finland and Germany approximates. The so-called extended GDP, which comprises market and household production, is almost equal in Finland and Germany. This signifies a resembling value of productive capacity. However, the shares <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and market production in the entire production diverge. Germany features a higher share <b>of</b> <b>household</b> production and a lower share of market production. Finland, by contrast, offers the complementary ratio.
