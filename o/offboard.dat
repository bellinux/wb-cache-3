25|$|As {{defined by}} the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws {{propulsion}} energy from a traction battery with at least 4 kwh of capacity and uses an <b>offboard</b> source of energy to recharge such battery. The tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 4 kwh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the maximum amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Both the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in December 2010, are eligible for the maximum $7,500 tax credit. The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, released in January 2012, is eligible for a $2,500 tax credit due to its smaller battery capacity of 5.2 kWh. All Tesla cars and Chevrolet Bolts are eligible for the 7,500 tax credit.|$|E

Lowther was able to obtain a smaller ship, named the Happy Delivery, and parted ways with Massey and his men.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 2002, the U.S. Navy updated the {{remaining}} active Oliver Hazard Perry-class warships' Phalanx CIWS to the [...] "Block 1B" [...] capability, which allowed the Mk 15 20 mm Phalanx gun {{to shoot at}} fast-moving surface craft and helicopters. They were also to have been fitted with the Mk 53 DLS [...] "Nulka" [...] missile decoy system, {{in place of the}} SRBOC (Super Rapid Blooming <b>Offboard</b> Chaff) and flares, which would have better protected the ship against anti-ship missiles. It had been planned to outfit {{the remaining}} ships with a 32-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher at the location of the former Mk-13, but this did not occur.|$|E
50|$|Patiño is {{fitted with}} three navigation-surface search and {{helicopter}} control radars operating at I-band. The {{management of the}} ships communications is made through the Integrated Communications Control System (ICCS 3rd generation) from the Portuguese EID. The countermeasures equipment includes: four mk36 SRBOC (super rapid blooming <b>offboard</b> chaff), six-barrelled launchers from Lockheed Martin Sippican der four infrared decoys and chaff, distraction and deflection of incoming anti-ship missiles {{to a range of}} 4 km; an AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed torpedo decoy system from Argon ST of Newington, Virginia. The two towed units emit acoustic signals from an onboard transmitter. The vessel is also equipped with an Aldebaran Electronic Support Measures / Electronic Countermeasures (ESM / ECM) system from Spain's Indra Group.|$|E
5000|$|Nulka is an Australian {{designed}} and developed active missile decoy built by an American/Australian collaboration. Used aboard warships of the United States Navy (USN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN), United States Coast Guard (USCG), and Royal Canadian Navy, Nulka is a rocket propelled, disposable, <b>offboard,</b> active decoy designed to ″seduce″ anti-ship missiles {{away from their}} targets. It has a unique design in that it hovers in mid air while seducing the incoming anti-ship missile. The hovering rocket concept was initiated in Australia by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), and the system was designed, developed and then manufactured by AWA Defence Industries (AWADI) (now BAE Systems Australia). The word [...] "Nulka" [...] is of Australian Aboriginal origin and means [...] "be quick".|$|E
5000|$|The BAE Systems Mark 36 Super Rapid Bloom <b>Offboard</b> Countermeasures Chaff and Decoy Launching System (abbreviated as SRBOC or [...] "Super-arboc") is a {{short-range}} mortar that launches chaff or infrared decoys from {{naval vessels}} to foil anti-ship missiles. Each launcher has three tubes {{set at a}} 45-degree angle, and three tubes set at a 60 degree angle, providing an effective spread of decoys and countermeasures to defeat radio frequency emitting missiles. The SRBOC can also be fitted with the TORCH infrared [...] "flare" [...] decoy system. A typical ship's load is 20 to 35 rounds per launcher.As of 2010, the Mk. 36 SRBOC is used by 19 navies around the world. It {{is similar to the}} NATO Sea Gnat system.|$|E
5000|$|As {{computer}} power grew, {{it became}} possible {{to host the}} PS system in the computer rather than the printer. This led to the natural evolution of PS from a printing system to one that {{could also be used}} as the host's own graphics language. There were numerous advantages to this approach; not only did it help eliminate the possibility of different output on screen and printer, but it also provided a powerful graphics system for the computer, and allowed the printers to be [...] "dumb" [...] {{at a time when the}} cost of the laser engines was falling. In a production setting, using PostScript as a display system meant that the host computer could render low-resolution to the screen, higher resolution to the printer, or simply send the PS code to a smart printer for <b>offboard</b> printing.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{serialize}} accesses between data records on a loosely coupled system, a practice known as record locking must be used. This {{means that when}} one mainframe processor obtains a hold on a record, the mechanism must prevent all other processors from obtaining the same hold and communicate to the requesting processors that they are waiting. Within any tightly coupled system, this is easy to manage between I-streams via {{the use of the}} Record Hold Table. However, when the lock is obtained <b>offboard</b> of the TPF processor in the DASD control unit, an external process must be used. Historically, the record locking was accomplished in the DASD control unit via an RPQ known as LLF (Limited Locking Facility) and later ELLF (extended). LLF and ELLF were both replaced by the Multipathing Lock Facility (MPLF). To run, clustered (loosely coupled) z/TPF requires either MPLF in all disk control units or an alternative locking device called a Coupling Facility.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{supercomputer}} architectures {{pioneered by}} Seymour Cray relied on compact designs and local parallelism to achieve superior computational performance. Cray had noted that increasing processor speeds did little {{if the rest}} of the system did not also improve; the CPU would end up waiting longer for data to arrive from the <b>offboard</b> storage units. The CDC 6600, the first mass-produced supercomputer, solved this problem by providing ten simple computers whose only purpose was to read and write data to and from main memory, allowing the CPU to concentrate solely on processing the data. This made both the main CPU and the ten [...] "PPU" [...] units much simpler. As such, they were physically smaller and reduced the amount of wiring between the various parts. This reduced the electrical signaling delays and allowed the system to run at a higher clock speed. The 6600 outperformed all other machines by an average of 10 times when it was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{approach}} {{is known as}} inductive charging. A special 'paddle' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a transformer, while the other {{is built into the}} car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one inductive charging system, [...] one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays {{on the floor of the}} garage. The advantage of the inductive {{approach is}} that there is no possibility of electrocution as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and ground fault detectors can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. Inductive charging can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry <b>offboard.</b> An inductive charging proponent from Toyota contended in 1998, that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging proponent from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient.|$|E
50|$|The Paraguayan fleet was a {{fraction}} of the size of Brazil's, even before the battle. It arrived at the Fortress of Humaitá on the morning of June the 9th. Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López prepared to attack at Riachuelo the ships supporting allied land troops. Nine ships and seven cannon-carrying barges, totaling 45 guns, plus 22 guns and two Congreve rocket batteries from river bank located troops, attacked the Brazilian squadron, nine ships with a total of 58 guns. The Paraguayans had planned a surprise strike before sunrise since they were fully aware that the gross of Imperial Brazilian troops would <b>offboard</b> their steamers in order to sleep on land, leaving thus a small garrison of men to guard and watch their fleet. The original plan had been that, under the dark of the night, the Paraguayan steamers would sneak up to the docked Brazilian vessels and board them outright. No confrontation other than the one carried out by the boarding party was planned, and the Paraguayan steamers were only there to provide cover from the inland battling forces.|$|E
5000|$|To be precise, A-GPS {{features}} depend {{mostly on}} an internet network or connection to an ISP (or CNP, {{in the case}} of CP/mobile-phone device linked to a cellular network provider data service). A mobile (cell phone, smart phone) device with just an L1 front-end radio receiver and no GPS acquisition, tracking, and positioning engine only works when it has an internet connection to an ISP/CNP, where the position fix is calculated <b>offboard</b> the device itself. It doesn't work in areas with no coverage or internet link (or nearby BTS towers, in the case on CNP service coverage area). Without one of those resources, it can't connect to the A-GPS servers usually provided by CNPs. On the other hand, a mobile device with a GPS chipset requires no data connection to capture and process GPS data into a position solution, since it receives data directly from the GPS satellites and is able to calculate a position fix itself. However, the availability of a data connection can provide assistance to improve the performance of the GPS chip on the mobile device.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the onboard ECM, another active countermeasure is the Towed Radar Decoy or TRD. Either one or two Ariel Mk II TRD from SELEX Galileo will be carried {{in the rear of}} starboard wingtip pod, and deployed from the pod on a 100 m long Kevlar cable containing a FibreOptic link and a separate power line. The Ariel Mk II is a development of BAE Systems Ariel system which has already been successfully deployed on RAF Tornado's and Nimrod's but is physical smaller to enable carriage in the Typhoon's pods. The TRD can tolerate speeds of up to Mach 2 and loads of + 9 / -3g and will be capable of being recovered or jettisoned as the situation requires.The TRDs are effective against a variety of different radar systems like monopulse, TWS or COLS (Command Line Off Sight) radars. As the TRD is an <b>offboard</b> jammer, radar systems featuring a home on jam mode (HOJ) {{will not be able to}} directly lock on to the aircraft itself. The effectiveness is further enhanced by the release of Chaff clouds making the decoy a more attractive target for the missile.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 {{while in}} the Persian Gulf, the ship {{assisted}} in [...] "Operation Southern Watch" [...] and in [...] "Operation Vigilant Sentinel". During an underway replenishment with the [...] the Sacramento lost her steering and collided into the starboard side of the Abraham Lincoln, crushing the M-frames, partially crushing a female crew berthing area, and punching a large hole in the TACAN room of the Sacramento. The Lincoln sustained damage to her catwalks, an aircraft elevator was jammed into the up position and an approximately 10ft2 hole was torn into the island. Both ships had to dock at Jebel Ali, U.A.E. for repair, the latter for several weeks.In 1996 the Sacramento had one NATO Sea Sparrow launcher on the forecastle, two Phalanx CIWS past mid-ship port and starboard, one 25 mm automatic cannon on the port side, and four [...]50 caliber machine guns: two port and two starboard. The ship was also fitted with electronic warfare equipment: an AN/SLQ-32 with four MK.36 super-RBOC (Rapid Bloom <b>Offboard</b> Chaff) decoys, and an AN/SLQ-25 towed torpedo decoy (NIXIE) run by an electronics technician.Sacramento was deployed to the Persian Gulf and supported operations during the First Gulf War.|$|E
5000|$|Simply put, this {{architecture}} {{extends the}} existing World Wide Web infrastructure of networked web servers {{down into the}} product at its subsystem's controller level using a Systems Engineering [...] "system of systems" [...] nested approach. Its core is an embedded dual function webserver/computer workstation connected to the product controller's test ports (as used in retrofit applications, or integrated directly into the controller for new products), hence providing access to operational cycles, sensor and other information in a clustered, internet addressable node that allows for local or remote access, {{and the ability to}} host remotely reconfigurable software that can collect and process data from its mated subsystem controller onboard and pull in other computing resources throughout the network. It can then establish a localized wireless World Wide Web in and around the product that can be securely connected to by a mechanic with any web browser-equipped handheld independent of the greater World Wide Web, as well as seamlessly integrate into global networks when external wireless communications is available - thus creating data Digital Twins at the factory, connecting deployed product usage in the Product lifecycle with constantly updated digital threads. This allows for an integrated approach which enables both offline and online updates to occur. Legacy systems usually require a human to physically connect a laptop to the system controller or a telematic solution to manually collect data and carry it back to a location where it can be later transferred to the factory or to restricted webserver-based download sites for <b>offboard</b> analysis.|$|E
50|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{have long}} included {{at least a}} few effect units, often tone controls for bass and treble, an integrated tremolo system (sometimes incorrectly labeled (and marketed) as vibrato), and/or a mechanical spring reverb unit. In the 2010s, guitar amps often have onboard distortion effects. Some 2010-era amps provide multiple effects, such as chorus, flanger, phaser and octave down effects. The use of <b>offboard</b> effects such as stompbox pedals is made possible by either plugging the guitar into the external effect pedal and then plugging the effect pedal into the amp, or by using one or more effects loops, an arrangement that allows effects to be electrically or mechanically switched in or out of the signal path as desired. In the signal chain, the effects loop is typically located between the preamplifier stage and the power amplifier stages (though reverb units generally precede the effects loop if both are featured on an amplifier). This allows the guitarist to apply modulation effects to the signal after it has been processed through the preamplifier, something generally desirable, particularly with time-based effects such as delay. By the 2010s, guitar amplifiers usually included a distortion effect. Effects circuitry (whether internal to an amplifier or not) can be taken as far as amp modeling, by which is meant alteration of the electrical and audible behavior {{in such a way as}} to make an amp sound as though it were another (or one of several) amplifiers. When done well, a solid state amplifier can sound like a tube amplifier (even one with power supply sag), reducing the need to manage more than one amp. Some modeling systems even attempt to emulate the sound of different speakers/cabinets. Nearly all amp and speaker cabinet modeling is done digitally, using computer techniques (e.g., Digital Signal Processing or DSP circuitry and software). There is disagreement about whether this approach is musically satisfactory, and also whether this or that unit is more or less successful than another.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 March 2010, {{a report}} from the Government Accountability Office to United States Senate Committee on Armed Services {{projected}} the overall unit cost of an F-35A to be $113 million in [...] "today's money". In 2010, Pentagon officials disclosed that the F-35 program had exceeded its original cost estimates by more than 50 percent. An internal Pentagon report critical of the JSF project stated that [...] "affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar". In 2010, Lockheed Martin expected {{they would be able to}} reduce costs projected by government estimators by 20 percent. On 24 March 2010, Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense, in testimony before Congress, declared the cost overruns and delays [...] "unacceptable", characterizing previous cost and schedule estimates as [...] "overly rosy". Gates insisted the F-35 would become [...] "the backbone of U.S. air combat for the next generation" [...] and informed Congress that he had extended the development period by an additional 13 months and budgeted $3 billion more for the testing program, while slowing down production. In August 2010, Lockheed Martin announced delays in resolving a [...] "wing-at-mate overlap" [...] production problem, which would slow initial production. In November 2010, as part of a cost-cutting measure, the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested cancelling the F-35B and halving orders for F-35As and F-35Cs. Air Force Magazine reported that [...] "Pentagon officials" [...] were considering canceling the F-35B because its short range meant that the forward bases or amphibious ships from which it would operate would be in range of hostile tactical ballistic missiles. Lockheed Martin consultant Loren B. Thompson said that this ″rumor″ was a result of the usual tensions between the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and there was no alternative other than the F-35B as a replacement for AV-8B Harrier II. He also confirmed that there were further delays and cost increases due to technical problems with the aircraft and software, blaming most of the delays and extra costs on redundant flight tests. In November 2010, the Center for Defense Information expected that the F-35 program would be restructured, resulting in an additional year of delay and increasing the cost by another $5 billion. On 5 November 2010, the Block 1 software flew for the first time on BF-4. As of the end of 2010, it was said that only 15% of the software remained to be written, but this was reported to include the most difficult sections such as data fusion. In 2011, it was revealed that actually, only 50% of the estimated eight million lines of code needed had been written and that, according to the newest schedule, it would take another six years to complete the software. By 2012, the total estimated lines of code for the entire program (onboard and <b>offboard)</b> had grown from the previous year's estimate of 8 million lines to 24 million lines.|$|E
