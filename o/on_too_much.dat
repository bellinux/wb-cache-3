5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
25|$|According to wine expert Oz Clarke, {{well made}} {{examples}} of Blaufränkisch will have notes of red currants and blackberry fruit. The grape {{does have the}} potential to have high tannins and acidity levels which can be moderated by harvest decisions and some oak aging. However, Clarke notes that wines from Blaufränkisch can take <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> oak flavoring and come across as excessively oaky. When blended with other varieties, Blaufränkisch often contributes acidity and structure to the blend.|$|E

However, according to Forbes, the revenue and operating net income of both the Rangers and the Dallas Stars went up from 2006 to 2008. Between the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the debt level for the Texas Rangers increased by approximately $100 million, {{the same time period}} when Hicks purchased Liverpool Football Club. From 2007 to 2009, Forbes reported the Rangers and the Stars were the third most leveraged franchises in their respective sports.|$|E

25|$|This {{design is}} simple, {{but a good}} basis for a {{practical}} design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably {{be found in a}} real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt {{be accounted for by}} the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

Robert Christgau believed the New York Dolls relied more on cover songs for the album because, [...] "like so many cocky songwriters, David Johansen overloaded his debut with originals and then found that record promotion wasn't a life activity that inspired new ones."

500|$|Affondatore sank in a {{storm in}} Ancona harbour on 6 August 1866, {{which may have been}} due to damage {{received}} during the Battle of Lissa. According to naval historians Greene and Massignani, however, Affondatore merely took <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water due to her low freeboard; the damage sustained at Lissa {{had nothing to do with}} her sinking. After refloating, Affondatore was rebuilt at La Spezia from 1867 to 1873. The ship's masts and sails were removed, with a single mast carrying a fighting top fitted in their place.

500|$|Although he had {{intended}} to finish the version of [...] "Dark Horse" [...] taped at Friar Park with Voormann and Starr, Harrison decided to re-record the song with the tour band, live, on the sound stage at A Studios. The session took place on either 30 or 31 October, with Norm Kinney as engineer. Leng writes of this performance of [...] "Dark Horse": [...] "Anyone wondering what Harrison's voice sounded like on the Dark Horse Tour need look no further: this track was cut only days before the first date in Vancouver. Although the band sounded good, his voice was in shreds..." [...] Later, Harrison would admit he was [...] "knackered" [...] {{by the time he}} arrived in Los Angeles, having simply taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> over the previous year.

500|$|Concentrating {{the company}} on {{consumer}} food, in 1994 he sold the Alpopetfood business to Nestlé for $510 million in cash. In February 1995 he participated in Grand Met's friendly takeover of Pet, Inc., the makers of Old El Paso branded Tex-Mex foods, for $2.6billion. A number of analysts feared {{at the time that}} Grand Met had overpaid for the company, and was taking <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> debt, but Walsh defended the acquisition, arguing, [...] "we are paying a fair price for attractive brands", adding that he had faith in the continued growth of the Tex-Mex food sector. In October 1995 he joined the Grand Met board of directors and assumed additional responsibility for Grand Met's Paris-based European food operations. In 1996 he was made chairman and president of Pillsbury. Investors Chronicle described Pillsbury as [...] "well managed" [...] under his leadership. Walsh was credited with re-energising the company, and operating profits grew from $250 million to $660 million between 1992 and 1996.|$|E
500|$|Cryptum was {{met with}} varying reviews. Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, [...] "It's hard {{to care about the}} flimsy characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive {{throughout}} and overall, not enough happens." [...] He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, [...] "This is one for the die-hard Halo fans." [...] Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. The author of Artistic Gamings review of Cryptum found it difficult to like the book's characters due to the condescending tone of Bornstellar, also concluding that it is only suited to diehard fans. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson. Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and ruining the suspense.|$|E

500|$|The Borodino-class {{battleship}} was a {{class of}} five pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy {{around the end of}} the 19th century. Their design was based on that of the French-built [...] modified to use Russian equipment. The first four ships were finished after the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and were among the ships ordered to sail from the Baltic Sea to the Far East to relieve the Pacific Squadron besieged by the Japanese in Port Arthur. Three of these ships were sunk and one was captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The fifth and final ship, , was not completed in time to participate in the war and served with the Baltic Fleet through World War I. She spent most of the war defending the Gulf of Riga and was badly damaged by German dreadnoughts during the Battle of Moon Sound in 1917. This damage forced the ship's crew to scuttle her because she had taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water and could not pass through the shallow channel that connected the Gulf of Riga with the Baltic. The wreck was scrapped during the 1930s by the Estonians.|$|E
500|$|ONUC {{forces in}} Katanga {{were under the}} command of General Prem Chand and his {{operational}} deputy, Brigadier Reginald Noronha. ONUC force strength had been raised to 18,200, 70 percent of whom were deployed in and around Katanga. Peacekeeping contingents from Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Ireland, Sweden, and Tunisia were earmarked by the UN to carry out Operation Grandslam. In order to simultaneously deploy these troops for the operation, the UN required a large airlift capability. ONUC had amassed an air transport fleet of 65 planes, the largest being Douglas DC-4s, but it was still insufficient for Operation Grandslam. Thant's military attaché, Indar Jit Rikhye, had requested assistance from the United States Department of Defense. Several days later, the United States committed its air force to provide logistical support. In November United States President John F. Kennedy offered to supply the UN with American fighter jets to exert an [...] "overwhelming show of strength from the air". Thant, though desiring forceful UN ground and air action, was eager to keep ONUC impartial and wanted to refrain from calling <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> support from any major world powers. On 16 December he declared that he would consider the American offer if the situation remained deadlocked by the Spring of 1963. This proved unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|A six-inch manilla rope {{was passed}} from the tanker's stern to the destroyer's midship oiling bollard, the idea being to take the stern to port, whilst the {{minesweeper}} [...] towed her; but Ledbury put <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> weight and the minesweeper's tow parted. Penn then asked Ledbury to take the tanker in tow from ahead, which was done, using the tanker's tow and a shackle of Ledburys towing hawser-cable. Rye took the destroyer in tow to keep the ship from falling off, whilst Penn went alongside the starboard side of the tanker {{to act as a}} drag to keep her straight. Ledburys gunner, {{who was in charge of}} the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain. In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crews brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour.|$|E
