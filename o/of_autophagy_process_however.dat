40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) {{remains the}} most {{aggressive}} and lethal brain tumor due to its molecular heterogeneity and high motility and invasion capabilities of its cells, resulting in high resistance to current standard treatments (surgery, followed by ionizing radiation combined with Temozolomide chemotherapy administration). Locus amplification, gene overexpression, and genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are hallmarks of GBM that can ectopically activate downstream signaling oncogenic cascades such as PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Importantly, alteration of this pathway, involved also in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> <b>process,</b> can improve radioresistance in GBM cells, thus promoting the aggressive phenotype of this tumor. In this work, the endogenous EGFR expression profile and autophagy were modulated to increase radiosensitivity behavior of human T 98 G and U 373 MG GBM cells. Our results primarily indicated that EGFR interfering induced radiosensitivity according to a decrease of the clonogenic capability of the investigated cells, and an effective reduction of the in vitro migratory features. Moreover, EGFR interfering resulted in an increase of Temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxicity in T 98 G TMZ-resistant cells. In order to elucidate the involvement <b>of</b> the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> as pro-death or pro-survival role in cells subjected to EGFR interfering, the key autophagic gene ATG 7 was silenced, thereby producing a transient block <b>of</b> the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process.</b> This <b>autophagy</b> inhibition rescued clonogenic capability of irradiated and EGFR-silenced T 98 G cells, suggesting a pro-death autophagy contribution. To further confirm the functional interplay between EGFR and autophagy pathways, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy induction during EGFR modulation promoted further impairment of irradiated cells, in terms of clonogenic and migration capabilities. Taken together, these results might suggest a novel combined EGFR-autophagy modulation strategy, to overcome intrinsic GBM radioresistance, thus improving the efficacy of standard treatments. J.

In this study, we performed a drug screen of SMYD 2 -/- cells and discovered that SMYD 2 deficiency enhanced the cell death induced by BIX 01294, an inhibitor of histone H 3 K 9 methylation. BIX- 01294 induces accumulation of LC 3 II and autophagy-related cell death, but not caspase-dependent apoptosis. We profiled the global gene expression pattern after treatment with BIX- 01294, in comparison with rapamycin. BIX- 01294 selectively activates the downstream genes of p 53 signaling, such as p 21 and DOR, but not PUMA, a typical p 53 target gene inducing apoptosis. BIX- 01294 also induces other autophagy-related genes, such as ATG 4 A and ATG 9 A. SMYD 2 is a methyltransferase for p 53 and regulates its transcription activity. Its deficiency enhances the BIX- 01294 -induced autophagy-related cell death through transcriptionally promoting the expression of p 53 target genes.

30|$|Autophagy is a conserved catabolic {{process that}} {{delivers}} damaged organelles or long-lived proteins to lysosomes for bulk degradation (Kroemer and Levine, 2008; Rubinsztein et al., 2011), {{which is considered}} as a mechanism that protects cells against accumulation of damaged organelles and DNA, misfolded proteins, and allows cells to mobilize their energy reserves in response to nutrients depletion, hypoxia, and ER stress (Gonzalez-Polo et al., 2005; Kouroku et al., 2007; Galluzzi et al., 2008; Morselli et al., 2010). During the autophagic process, pre-autophagosome elongates and fuses to form double-membrane vesicle autophagosomes within the cytoplasm. The autophagosomes fuse with acidic lysosomes where the entrapped contents are degraded by proteases. The ER, mitochondria as well as plasma membrane are the major membrane sources contributing to the maturation of pre- or autophagosomal structures (Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Hailey et al., 2010; Ravikumar et al., 2010). More than 30 different genes regulating autophagy have been identified and characterized so far.

In the current study, we examined the presence of microangiopathy and autophagy-related structures in sural nerve biopsies of 10 patients with CIAP, 11 controls with inflammatory neuropathy and 10 controls without sensory polyneuropathy. We {{did not find any}} significant difference in endoneurial microangiopathic markers in patients with CIAP compared to normal controls, though we did find a correlation between basal lamina area thickness and age. Unexpectedly, we found a significantly larger basal lamina area thickness in patients with vasculitic neuropathy. Furthermore, we found a significantly higher density of endoneurial autophagy-related structures, particularly in patients with CIAP but also in patients with inflammatory neuropathy, compared to normal controls. It is unclear if the alteration in the autophagy pathway is a consequence or a cause of the neuropathy. Our results do not support the hypothesis that CIAP is primarily caused by a microangiopathic process in endoneurial blood vessels in peripheral nerves. The significantly higher density <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> structures in sural nerves obtained from patients with CIAP and inflammatory neuropathy vs. controls indicates the involvement of this pathway in neuropathy, particularly in CIAP, since the increase in density of autophagy-related structures was more pronounced in patients with CIAP than those with inflammatory neuropathy.

This currently combined radio-chemotherapy treatment resulted in glial tumor cell death induction, whose main molecular death pathways are still not completely deciphered. In this study, the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> was investigated, and in vitro modulated, in two different GB cell lines, T 98 G and U 373 MG (known to differ in their radiosensitivity), after IR or combined IR/TMZ treatments. T 98 G cells showed a high radiosensitivity (especially at low and intermediate doses), associated with autophagy activation, assessed by Beclin- 1 and Atg- 5 expression increase, LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion and LC 3 B-GFP accumulation in autophagosomes of irradiated cells; differently, U 373 MG cells resulted less radiosensitive. Autophagy inhibition, using siRNA against BECN 1 or ATG- 7 genes, totally prevented decrease in viability after both IR and IR/TMZ treatments in the radiosensitive T 98 G cells, confirming the autophagy involvement in the cytotoxicity of these cells after the current GB treatment, contrary to U 373 MG cells. However, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy, that further radiosensitized T 98 G, was able to promote radiosensitivty also in U 373 MG cells, suggesting a role <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> in enhancing radiosensitivity.

It has been observed that autophagic activity declines with age and this decline is associated with accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, a common characteristic feature of aging (Vittorini et al., 1999; Cuervo and Dice, 2000). Up-regulation of important components <b>of</b> the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> prevents age-dependent neuronal damage and enhances longevity in Drosophila (Simonsen et al., 2008). Mutation of autophagy-related gene Atg 7 results in hypersensitive to nutrient and oxidative stress and decreased lifespan in Drosophila (JuhÃ¡sz et al., 2007).

Malfunction <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> has been related to many human diseases, including cancer, liver, heart and lung diseases and neurodegeneration. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study the molecular mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> and how autophagy activity is regulated. Autophagy can be non selective or selective. Selective engulfment <b>of</b> peroxisomes by <b>autophagy</b> is termed pexophagy. Collaborating with Kai Mao, a previous Ph.

The selective autophagy scaffold Atg 11 and the pexophagy specific receptor Atg 36 are able to interact with the fission machinery components including Dnm 1 and Vps 1 on peroxisomes being degraded. These findings imply that the autophagy machinery recruits peroxisome fission machinery to drive pexophay specific fission, facilitating efficient engulfment of the organelle. The later steps <b>of</b> the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> involve fusion <b>of</b> the outer membrane of autophagosomes with the vacuole membrane.

We observed that 10 primary and 91 secondary interacting proteins of HYPK are associated with two types <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes.</b> We next tested the hypothesis that the hub, HYPK, might itself be involved in autophagy. Using mouse striatal STHdh(Q 7) /Hdh(Q 7) cell lines, we observed that over expression of HYPK significantly increased background cellular autophagy, while knock down of endogenous HYPK decreased the autophagy level as detected by altered LC 3 I conversion, BECN 1 expression, cleavage of GFP from LC 3 -GFP, ATG 5 -ATG 12 conjugate formation and expression of transcription factors like Tfeb, Srebp 2 and Zkscan 3. This result shows that HYPK, possibly with its interacting partners, induces autophagy. We further observed that N-terminal mutant HTT reduced the cellular levels of LC 3 II and BECN 1, which could be recovered significantly upon over expression of HYPK in these cells.

The chapter focuses on the fusion and fission events between compartments of the endolysosomal system and autophagic membranes, respectively. Lysosome-related disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding for proteins that directly affect lysosomal functioning, including lysosomal hydrolases and lysosomal membrane proteins...|$|R

We discovered that melanoma, which is generally resistant to drug-induced apoptosis, can undergo autophagic cell death with the participation of orphan nuclear receptor TR 3. A sequence of molecular events leading to cellular demise is launched by a specific chemical compound, 1 -(3, 4, 5 -trihydroxyphenyl) nonan- 1 -one, newly acquired from screening a library of TR 3 -targeting compounds. The autophagic cascade comprises TR 3 translocation to mitochondria through interaction with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Nix, crossing into the mitochondrial inner membrane through Tom 40 and Tom 70 channel proteins, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential by the permeability transition pore complex ANT 1 âVDAC 1 and induction <b>of</b> <b>autophagy.</b> This <b>process</b> leads to excessive mitochondria clearance and irreversible cell death.

40|$|Abstract Background Methylotrophic yeast species (e. g. Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris) {{can grow}} on {{methanol}} as sole source of carbon and energy. These organisms are important cell factories {{for the production}} of recombinant proteins, but are also used in fundamental research as model organisms to study peroxisome biology. During exponential growth on glucose, cells of H. polymorpha typically contain a single, small peroxisome that is redundant for growth while on methanol multiple, enlarged peroxisomes are present. These organelles are crucial to support growth on methanol, as they contain key enzymes of methanol metabolism. In this study, changes in the transcriptional profiles during adaptation of H. polymorpha cells from glucose- to methanol-containing media were investigated using DNA-microarray analyses. Results Two hours after the shift of cells from glucose to methanol nearly 20 % (1184 genes) of the approximately 6000 annotated H. polymorpha genes were significantly upregulated with at least a two-fold differential expression. Highest upregulation (> 300 -fold) was observed for the genes encoding the transcription factor Mpp 1 and formate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the methanol dissimilation pathway. Upregulated genes also included genes encoding other enzymes of methanol metabolism as well as of peroxisomal Î²-oxidation. A moderate increase in transcriptional levels (up to 4 -fold) was observed for several PEX genes, which are involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Only PEX 11 and PEX 32 were higher upregulated. In addition, an increase was observed in expression of the several ATG genes, which encode proteins involved in <b>autophagy</b> and <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes.</b> The strongest upregulation was observed for ATG 8 and ATG 11. Approximately 20 % (1246 genes) of the genes were downregulated. These included glycolytic genes as well as genes involved in transcription and translation. Conclusion Transcriptional profiling of H. polymorpha cells shifted from glucose to methanol showed the expected downregulation of glycolytic genes together with upregulation of the methanol utilisation pathway. This serves as a confirmation and validation of the array data obtained. Consistent with this, also various PEX genes were upregulated. The strong upregulation of ATG genes is possibly due to induction <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> <b>processes</b> related to remodeling of the cell architecture required to support growth on methanol. These processes may also be responsible for the enhanced peroxisomal Î²-oxidation, as autophagy leads to recycling of membrane lipids. The prominent downregulation of transcription and translation may be explained by the reduced growth rate on methanol (t d glucose 1 h vs t d methanol 4. 5 h). </p...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDrosophila Orb, the homolog of {{vertebrate}} CPEB, {{is a key}} translational regulator {{involved in}} oocyte polarity and maturation through poly(A) tail elongation of specific mRNAs. orb also has an essential function during early oogenesis {{that has not been}} addressed at the molecular level. Here, we show that orb prevents cell death during early oogenesis, thus allowing oogenesis to progress. It does so through the repression <b>of</b> <b>autophagy</b> by directly repressing, together with the CCR 4 deadenylase, the translation of Autophagy-specific gene 12 (Atg 12) mRNA. Autophagy and cell death observed in orb mutant ovaries are reduced by decreasing Atg 12 or other Atg mRNA levels. These results reveal a role of Orb in translational repression and identify autophagy as an essential pathway regulated by Orb during early oogenesis. Importantly, they also establish translational regulation as a major mode <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>autophagy,</b> a key <b>process</b> in cell homeostasis in response to environmental cues...|$|R

In the present study, TCam- 2 cells, which are considered a good model of mitotically active male germ cells, were used to investigate intracellular signalling and cell metabolism during exposure to simulated microgravity, a condition that affects cell shape and cytoskeletal architecture. After a 24 [*]hour exposure to simulated microgravity, TCam- 2 cells showed 1) a decreased proliferation rate and a delay in cell cycle progression, 2) increased anaerobic metabolism accompanied by increased levels of intracellular Ca(2 +), reactive oxygen species and superoxide anion and modifications in mitochondrial morphology. Interestingly, all these events were transient and were no longer evident after 48 [*]hours of exposure. The presence of antioxidants prevented not only the effects described above but also the modifications in cytoskeletal architecture and the activation <b>of</b> the <b>autophagy</b> <b>process</b> induced by simulated microgravity.
