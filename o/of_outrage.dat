5|$|Franklin P. Dewees of the party's {{executive}} committee called the convention to order at 12:30p.m. on June 9. Reverend Pearl P. Ingalls of Iowa said a brief prayer, and the convention was opened. Gilbert De La Matyr, a Methodist minister and Greenback congressman from Indiana, was unanimously chosen as temporary chairman. After De La Matyr gave a brief, fiery speech, they proceeded {{to call the}} roll, which included delegates from every state except Oregon. As the roll call finished, Matilda Joslyn Gage, a suffragist, mounted the stage, provoking cheers from some delegates and howls <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> from others. She called for the new party to recognize women's right to vote, but the issue was avoided temporarily when the delegates voted to send her petition to a committee for further study.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the game engine's source code, the {{possibilities}} of changing the game greatly opened up, and the fan community made use of the code to update the game using recent technology. Led by Edward Gardner and Ian Warfield, the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a core engine for others to take advantage of. Using the new fan-updated engine, projects such as Beyond the Red Line, based on the new Battlestar Galactica, and The Babylon Project, based on Babylon 5, have become possible. PXO, the free Internet gaming service handling SquadWar, was initially acquired by THQ in their 2002 acquisition <b>of</b> <b>Outrage</b> Entertainment (renamed as Outrage Games). The service was continued until July 2003, when Outrage Games was dissolved and PXO terminated. The components of its website were, however, later handed over to the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project to help them create a similar service in tracking statistics and rankings.|$|E

25|$|In the December 1997 issue <b>of</b> <b>Outrage,</b> Brumby {{acknowledged}} {{that she is}} a lesbian, and although some see her as a role model, her sexuality is only one facet of her personality and she would rather be described as a musician.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that Hellmuth Reinhard took the initiative {{to put an end}} to all Jews in Norway. This may have been motivated by his own ambition, and it's possible he was encouraged by the lack <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> over the initial measures targeting Jews.|$|E
25|$|This article {{gives the}} {{international}} {{reaction to the}} 2008 Tibetan unrest, from countries worldwide. The 2008 Tibetan unrest {{was a series of}} attacks and protests concerning human rights in China in the buildup to the 2008 Summer Olympics. There was a mixture <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> and understanding from leading figures abroad.|$|E

25|$|Kitano rose to {{prominence}} in the 1970s as {{one half of the}} comedy duo Two Beat, before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country. After several small acting roles, he made his directorial debut with 1989's Violent Cop and garnered international acclaim for Sonatine (1993). But he was not accepted as a director in Japan until Hana-bi won the Golden Lion in 1997. In October 2017, Kitano's completed his Outrage crime trilogy with the release <b>of</b> <b>Outrage</b> Coda.|$|E

25|$|On August 6, the Committee of Detail {{reported}} its proposed {{revisions to}} the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks <b>of</b> <b>outrage.</b> Over the next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then. Later generations could try out their own answers. The delegates {{were trying to make}} a government that might last that long.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, he {{was arrested}} and imprisoned in the Bolshoy Dom in Leningrad. He was accused of counter-revolutionary activities, and sentenced to death. A world-wide storm <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> and {{pressure}} from Western governments and the International Red Cross forced the communist regime to commute the death sentence and instead on 3 Tammuz it banished him to Kostroma for an original sentence of three years. Yekaterina Peshkova, a prominent Russian human rights activist, helped from inside as well. This was also commuted following political pressure from the outside, and he was finally allowed to leave Russia for Riga in Latvia, where he lived from 1928 until 1929.|$|E
25|$|In the end, the Russian {{population}} {{pays for}} this corruption. For example, {{some experts believe}} that the rapid increases in tariffs for housing, water, gas and electricity, which significantly outpace the rate of inflation, are {{a direct result of}} high volumes of corruption at the highest levels. In the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed: starting from Putin's second term, very few corruption cases have been the subject <b>of</b> <b>outrage.</b> Putin's system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business, as well as its use of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property. Corporate, property, and land raiding is commonplace.|$|E

25|$|The Balloon Corps was {{eventually}} {{assigned to the}} Army Corps of Engineers and put under the administrative purview of one Captain Cyrus B. Comstock, who did not appreciate a civilian (Lowe) being paid more than he. He reduced Lowe's pay from $10 gold to $6 currency (equal to $3 gold) per day. Lowe posted a letter <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> and threatened to resign his position. No one came to his support, and Comstock remained unyielding. On 8 April 1863, Lowe left the military service {{and returned to the}} private sector. Direction of the Balloon Corps defaulted to the Allen brothers, but they were not as competent as Lowe. By 1 August 1863, the Corps was no longer used.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Congress {{passed the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened those territories to slavery if the local {{residents}} voted that way. The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A firestorm <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> brought together former Whigs, Know-Nothings, and former Free Soil Democrats {{to form a}} new party in 1854–56, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the Slave Power – that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, a {{small group}} <b>of</b> <b>OutRage!</b> members covertly formed a {{separate}} group {{to engage in a}} campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group's go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS's threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell's assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate the hypocrisy of those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.|$|E

25|$|That year, Queen began The Works Tour, {{the first}} tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney {{as an extra}} live musician. The tour {{featured}} nine sold-out dates in October in Bophuthatswana, South Africa, at the arena in Sun City. Upon returning to England, they were the subject <b>of</b> <b>outrage,</b> having played in South Africa {{during the height of}} apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural boycott. The band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in South Africa, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences. Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians' Union and placed on the United Nations' blacklisted artists.|$|E
25|$|In early January 2014, the {{province}} experienced wide spread power outages that effected 190,000 customers. The outages were {{a result of}} cold temperatures coupled with problems at generating facilities. The outages lasted for several days which caused businesses to close and delayed the opening of schools and post-secondary institutes following their Christmas break. Dunderdale faced criticism for not addressing the public until several days after rolling blackouts began. When she did address the public Dunderdale was accused of downplaying {{the significance of the}} blackouts. Former cabinet minister Shawn Skinner said Dunderdale lacked empathy and compassion when stating that there was no crisis. After weeks <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> over her handling of the power issue, which saw a PC MHA cross the floor to the Liberals, it was reported that Dunderdale was returning early from vacation to announce her resignation.|$|E
25|$|Upon his release, Azad {{returned}} to a political atmosphere charged with sentiments <b>of</b> <b>outrage</b> and rebellion against British rule. The Indian public had been angered by {{the passage of the}} Rowlatt Acts in 1919, which severely restricted civil liberties and individual rights. Consequently, thousands of political activists had been arrested and many publications banned. The killing of unarmed civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on 13 April 1919 had provoked intense outrage all over India, alienating most Indians, including long-time British supporters, from the authorities. The Khilafat struggle had also peaked with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the raging Turkish War of Independence, which had made the caliphate's position precarious. India's main political party, the Indian National Congress came under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who had aroused excitement all over India when he led the farmers of Champaran and Kheda in a successful revolt against British authorities in 1918. Gandhi organised the people of the region and pioneered the art of Satyagraha— combining mass civil disobedience with complete non-violence and self-reliance.|$|E
60|$|He {{slapped his}} bare chest violently; he {{uncovered}} his very ribs, all astir with the panting <b>of</b> <b>outraged</b> virtue; his smooth stomach heaved with indignation. He started his wide blue breeches flapping about his yellow calves. Heyst watched him quietly.|$|R
60|$|This {{complimentary}} {{reference to}} her father went far to soften the maiden's heart, but her sense <b>of</b> <b>outraged</b> dignity required {{that she should be}} loyal to herself as well as to her tribe, therefore she sniffed haughtily, but did not reply.|$|R
50|$|An appeal by the defence, on {{the point}} of the {{validity}} of the charge <b>of</b> <b>outraging</b> public decency, was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which upheld the trial judge's ruling and went some way to restating the law in this area.|$|R
