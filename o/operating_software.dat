5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Huawei faced {{a lawsuit}} from T-Mobile, which alleged that Huawei stole {{technology}} from its Bellevue, Washington, headquarters. T-Mobile claimed in its filed suit that Huawei's employees snuck into a T-Mobile lab {{during the period}} of 2012-2013 and stole parts of its smartphone testing robot Tappy. The Huawei employees then copied the <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> and design details, violating confidentiality agreements that both companies signed. Furthermore, Huawei is now using that intel to build its own testing robot. A Huawei spokesman stated to The New York Times that there is some truth to the complaint, but that the two employees involved have been fired. T-Mobile has since stopped using Huawei as a supplier, which T-Mobile says could cost it {{tens of millions of dollars}} as it moves away from its handsets.|$|E
25|$|The Cryptophon {{is built}} on the {{foundation}} of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the cryptography, Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems, but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the cryptography algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon – one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so {{it would also be}} possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> of the phone as well as the cryptography implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time.|$|E

2500|$|At its release, the Switch {{was praised}} by reviewers {{for having a}} lot of potential, but they were underwhelmed by the limited number of titles {{available}} at launch that did not show {{the full extent of the}} console's abilities. Reviewers also noted that the initial <b>operating</b> <b>software</b> and features were limited and included software bugs that, while likely to be fixed in time, marred the experience of the system. Even with the day-one update, there were numerous reports of hardware problems, in particular the Bluetooth connectivity of the Switch Console with the Joy-Con L controller, and ease with which the Console screen could be scratched. About a week after release, Fils-Aimé said the company is in [...] "fact-finding mode" [...] to try to diagnose these issues. In late March, Nintendo reported that the Joy-Con L desync issue was a [...] "manufacturing variation" [...] on a small number of the units, which could be easily fixed; as noted by CNet's Sean Hollister, Nintendo repaired affected controllers by placing a bit of foam near the antenna within the unit to better shield it. Going forward, Nintendo said they do not anticipate any other problems with connectivity issues. Many users also reported issues with defective pixels on the LCD screen of the Console, which Nintendo has stated [...] "are normal and should not be considered a defect". Other companies in the video game industry, such as Sony, Microsoft, Sega, Bethesda and Ubisoft, have congratulated Nintendo on the Switch.|$|E

Many of the modifications developed by universities were openly shared, in keeping with the academic principles of sharing knowledge, and organizations sprung up to facilitate sharing.
