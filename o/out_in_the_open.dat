He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|McAvoy's acting debut {{came at the}} age of 15 in The Near Room (1995). He later {{admitted}} that he was not very interested in acting when joining the film, but was inspired to study the acting after developing feelings for his co-star, Alana Brady. He continued to act while still a member of PACE Youth Theatre. McAvoy eventually graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 2000. Throughout the early 2000s, he made guest appearances in television shows and began working on movies. In 2001, McAvoy's performance as a gay hustler in the play <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Open</b> impressed director Joe Wright so much that Wright began offering McAvoy parts in his films. McAvoy kept declining them, however, and it wasn't until six years later that the two worked together.|$|E
5|$|Official {{regulation}} {{states that}} the flag must never touch the ground or water, or {{be used as a}} drapery in any form. The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.|$|E

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open)</b> through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{recognized}} subspecies across {{the range of}} these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, among other species. Some populations {{have been affected by}} mercury contamination.|$|E

5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, {{they thought it was}} solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in trophallaxis (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a disinfectant in order to nest in soil and leaf litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests that workers were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E
5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> truly <b>open</b> ocean. <b>The</b> silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary rural museums perform {{not only}} the {{traditional}} tasks but are also the places where both the visitors and the local community members have chances for entertainment and attractive leisure time.

5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found between environmental factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, {{transports}} with artillery, siege tools, {{and some}} French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, {{the northern end}} of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded into submission.

40|$|Presentation {{given at}} the C-EBLIP Symposium on October 12, 2016. In embarking on my own {{research}} this past year, I encountered periods of extreme self-doubt about my abilities. Librarians {{of all ages and}} experience levels have spoken frankly to me of their own impostor syndrome moments, most tied to research. I’ve observed, and experienced, an ability to find a niche in professional practice with much more ease than settling into the researcher persona. I see librarians undertaking more complex research, far beyond a former role as bibliographer. As a profession, we are receiving grants, conducting sophisticated research studies using multiple methodologies, and producing professionally published results. Yet many librarians I’ve talked to minimize these achievements and remain unsure of themselves as researchers. My doubts stem from inexperience—I’ve never supervised a student or written a graduate thesis, and took a single solitary course on research during my MLIS. The prevalence of impostor syndrome among librarian practitioner-researchers has piqued my curiosity, and I’m wondering if there are some ways we can support each other and build confidence as researchers throughout the profession. And thought it might start with talking about it <b>out</b> here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> with an audience full of practitioner-researchers, and share some strategies and ideas with each other...|$|R
