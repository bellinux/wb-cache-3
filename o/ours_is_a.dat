In 1938 Deputy Prime Minister Peter Fraser told Parliament, [...] "this country has to make up its own mind on international problems as a sovereign country – because under the Statute of Westminster <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sovereign country". In the 1944 Speech from the Throne the Governor-General announced the government's intention to adopt the Statute of Westminster. It was forced to abandon the proposal when the opposition accused the government of being disloyal to Britain at a time of need.|$|E
2500|$|... all {{mediation}} is remediation. We are not claiming {{this as an}} {{a priori}} truth, but rather arguing that at this extended historical moment, all current media function as remediators and that remediation offers us a means of interpreting the work of earlier media as well. Our culture conceives of each medium or constellation of media as it responds to, redeploys, competes with, and reforms other media. In the first instance, we may think of something like a historical progression, of newer media remediating older ones and in particular of digital media remediating their predecessors. But <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> genealogy of affiliations, not a linear history, and in this genealogy, older media can also remediate newer ones. (p. 55) ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{the postmodern}} must be {{characterized}} as {{a situation in which}} the survival, the residue, the holdover, the archaic, has finally been swept away without a trace. In the postmodern, then, the past itself has disappeared (along with the well-known [...] "sense of the past" [...] or historicity and collective memory). Where its buildings still remain, renovation and restoration allow them to be transferred to the present in their entirety as those other, very different and postmodern things called simulacra. Everything is now organized and planned; nature has been triumphantly blotted out, along with peasants, petit-bourgeois commerce, handicraft, feudal aristocracies and imperial bureaucracies. <b>Ours</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more homogeneously modernized condition; we no longer are encumbered with the embarrassment of non-simultaneities and non-synchronicities. Everything has reached the same hour on the great clock of development or rationalization (at least from the perspective of the [...] "West"). This is the sense in which we can affirm, either that modernism is characterized by a situation of incomplete modernization, or that postmodernism is more modern than modernism itself.|$|E

[...] Beyond this facade, the PS was torn by factionalism. The radical section made open calls for the party's transformation.
