5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E

5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, {{which has now}} grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. If the player rescues the Dachora and the Etecoons—the creatures Samus encountered earlier in the game—during the escape, they are shown leaving the planet in the distance.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> effect {{have proposed}} molecular explanations that explain spacing over short, but not long timescales. In <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> this paper, we review research on <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> effect that has employed spaces of 24 h or more across skill-related tasks, language-related tasks and generalization {{for adults and}} children. Throughout this review, we distinguish between learning and retention by defining learning (or acquisition) as performance at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> training and retention as performance after a delay period. Using this distinction, we find age- and task-related differences in <b>the</b> manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> effect over long timescales. In <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> this paper, we discuss a reconsolidation account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> effect. In particular, we review the evidence that suggests <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> <b>of</b> repetitions influences <b>the</b> subsequent consolidation and reconsolidation processes; we explain how a reconsolidation account may explain the findings for learning; the inverted-U curve for retention; and compare the reconsolidation account with previous consolidation accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> effect...|$|R
