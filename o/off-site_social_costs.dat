Five kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport are considered: traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, global warming, and traffic congestion. Major {{findings of this}} study are as follows. First, <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> increase at an accelerated rate as traffic volume increases. Second, the largest component of vehicular transport’s <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> on highways is traffic congestion, accounting for about 64 %. The second largest component is traffic accidents, accounting for 24 %. Third, among vehicle types, the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of buses are largest, at 105 yen per vehicle-km, about 16 times higher than the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of regular cars. Last, total <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> for whole highway networks are about 678, 212 million yen, or about 0. 13 % of Japan’s GDP.

40|$|Purpose - Construction projects, {{especially}} in the urban areas, generate serious environmental nuisances for the adjacent residents. Construction causative adverse impacts on the neighbouring communities are known as the <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> The amount of <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> changes {{from country to country}} depending on the applied building code of practices and building permission regulations. If the relevant code of practice is mandatory or the regulations are strict, contractors inherently will pay more attention to obey them and the occurrence of the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> is less likely. However, in many especially developing countries, like north Cyprus and Turkey, those rules are either not existing or loose and in this case high amount <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are caused by the contactors. The presence of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are broadly embraced in theory however, they are not predominantly applied yet during project initial cost estimation practices. One of the reasons for that is, the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are rather complicated to measure and quantify due to lack of a paradigm for practice that guides the professionals on how to classify and assess them in the most applicable way possible. Thus, this research aims to develop a generic a <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> estimation system for Turkey and North Cyprus construction industries which assists to identify the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> drivers, to estimate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> {{on the basis of the}} identified drivers, to incorporate <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> into project initial cost and to compensate it for the third parties. In this system, the contractors will be enforced to minimize the nuisances of the people residing around a construction site. Otherwise, the contractors will be forced to compensate them through a bonding system. Design/Methodology/Approach – the research adopts a triangulation strategy adopting multi-method approach in tackling the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> phenomenon through a rigorous research process. For example, through comprehensive literature review, the research identified the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> impact types; <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> components are established by the focus group through brainstorming sessions, and observations and self-experience in case study projects either via site visits or participating in the case study projects; the enumeration of the qualitative components of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are obtained via questionnaire based survey. Findings – The segmentation of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are evaluated as the impacts on house, household and neighbourhood. A total of 17 perceivable nuisance criteria are defined for those segments. The enumeration of all perceivable nuisance criteria is implemented where the estimated total <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> can be generated by using them. Practical implications – It paves a solid foundation for the professionals in the Turkish construction industry to perform precise building construction associated <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> estimations. Originality/value – This research provides sound and sequential system to estimate and compensate <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> for building constructions in the residential areas of developing countries.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{estimate}} and evaluate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of highways in Japan. In general, with more people concerned about protecting the environment at both local and global levels, dependence on vehicular transportation in cities has brought about problems. Too much dependence on autos causes air pollution, which has detrimental health effects. Furthermore, traffic congestion wastes time, money, and energy. The most concerning issue related to continuing dependence on car use is global warming. In order to implement transport policies conducive to creating a sustainable environment, it is necessary to measure correctly the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport such as traffic accidents, air pollution, noise, global warming, and traffic congestion. By using a data set from Japan, this paper aims to estimate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport on highways and to evaluate how extensive these <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> are by comparing, for example, highway fares relative to GDP. Our study has several distinguishing characteristics. The most important point is that we estimate each individual highway 8 ̆ 1 fs <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> by considering average speed at the peak period, total traffic volume, types of vehicular transport and so on. Second, this study distinguishes five kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport for individual highways in Japan: 1) traffic accidents, 2) air pollution, 3) noise, 4) global warming, and 5) traffic congestion. Third, by using a data set of over 50 individual highways in Japan in 2005, we analyze the relationship between the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport and traffic volumes in general. Last, by comparing highway fares, the degree of GDP, the fuel tax level, and other factors, we assess the magnitude of <b>social</b> <b>costs,</b> for the purpose of creating prudent transport policy. In order to attain the objectives mentioned above, we organize our study as follows. First, we summarize previous studies, with special attention to the kinds of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> used, the kinds of sub-items considered in estimating <b>social</b> <b>costs,</b> the aggregate level, the method of estimation, and the magnitude of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport. Second, we explain our method for estimating <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> In this section, we describe specific equations for the five main categories of highways 8 ̆ 1 f <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Third, based on these equations, by using a data set for highways in Japan, we estimate the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of vehicular transport on highways.

40|$|Many {{state public}} utility {{commissions}} (PUCs) {{have started to}} require electric utilities to consider environmental and other externalities in their planning processes. To date <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> has been applied exclusively to the evaluation of new sources of electricity.

We find that applying <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> at the investment stage only may lead to reduced investment in new resources, increased use of existing generation resources and higher emissions of key pollutants. Applying <b>social</b> <b>costing</b> to dispatch generally leads to increased levels of investment in clean technologies, lower levels of emissions and only moderate price increases.

How to lower energy consumption cost, which energy is optimal choice, and how <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of energy will impact on energy consumption, these questions are addressed in this dissertation via Energy Portfolio Management (EPM) model with framework and simulation. The EPM model is established to find out an optimal energy solution which can provide useful guidance to energy consumers and policymakers about how to select optimal energy portfolio with lower cost and less risk. The conceptual framework presents the methodology of EPM, while EPM simulations demonstrate the selection of optimal energy choices, and further, the impacts of <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> on the optimal energy portfolio in the case of United States. The findings from EPM Simulations fall into three categories: 1) without considering <b>social</b> <b>cost,</b> biomass and coal are optimal choices and should consume at the maximum; 2) considering single <b>social</b> <b>cost,</b> coal and nuclear are favored only if <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of coal is less than 100 % of its private <b>cost</b> or <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of nuclear is less than 300 % of its private cost, otherwise, biomass is optimal; 3) considering all sorts of <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> simultaneously, optimal energy portfolio varies with the level of social cost: with low and central level of <b>social</b> <b>cost,</b> coal and nuclear are preferable due to their stable and lower cost; with high level of <b>social</b> <b>cost,</b> biomass, nuclear and potential natural gas are still favored, however the optimal solution will switch to favor biomass (if <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of coal is more than 300 % of its private <b>cost</b> or <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of nuclear is 830 % more than its private cost.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} how collusion affects the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> in atomic splittable routing games. Suppose that players form coalitions and each coalition behaves {{as if it}} were a single player controlling all the flows of its participants. It may be tempting to conjecture that the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> would be lower after collusion, since there would be more coordination among the players. We construct examples to show that this conjecture is not true. Even in very simple single-source-single-destination networks, the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of the post-collusion equilibrium can be higher than that of the pre-collusion equilibrium. This counter-intuitive phenomenon of collusion prompts us to ask the question: under what conditions would the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of the post-collusion equilibrium be bounded by the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of the pre-collusion equilibrium? We show that if (i) the network is “well-designed ” (satisfying a natural condition), and (ii) the delay functions are affine, then collusion is always beneficial for the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> in the Nash equilibria. On the other hand, if either of the above conditions is unsatisfied, collusion can worsen the <b>social</b> <b>cost.</b> Our main technique is a novel flow-augmenting algorithm to build Nash equilibria. Our positive result for collusion is obtained by applying this algorithm simultaneously to two different flow value profiles of players and observing the difference in the derivatives of their <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Moreover, for a non-trivial subclass of selfish routing games, this algorithm finds the exact Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. ⋆ Research supported by an Alexander von Humboldt fellowship. ...|$|R

With other words does this measure reflects the impact of the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> ? [...]...|$|R

40|$|A traffic {{simulation}} and assignment {{model is}} used to compute the <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of congestion in five English towns, together with potential road charges. The <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> of congestion are measured by the deadweight loss and computed as the area between the marginal <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> and inverse demand curves between the actual and efficient levels of traffic. Potential road charges are computed as the difference between average private and marginal <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> at the efficient level of traffic, defined as {{the level at which}} marginal benefit, given by the inverse demand curve, and marginal cost, are equal. The exercise is done for different demand curves and elasticity values and for different areas within each town.

These costs are compared with the estimates of the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of the home consumption price scheme which has operated in the past. The comparison is made for various supply and demand conditions and for alternative pricing and quota policies. The method used is to model historical supply and demand relationships for the years 1965 - 6 to 1972 - 3. Actual price and quantity data for these years is then used to estimate the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> of home consumption pricing as it operated in that period. Simulated production controls are imposed on the model and the resulting <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits are estimated. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

Net <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> {{is the sum}} of construction costs and expected flood damage. This model is applied to data for the Rio Grande River at Embudo, New Mexico. Minimum <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> is attained at a spillway capacity much smaller than that needed to handle a probably maximum flood...|$|R
