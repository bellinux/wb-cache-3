25|$|A {{disaster}} appeal {{fund was}} set up with donations of £500,000 from the Government, £100,000 from Liverpool F.C. and £25,000 each from the cities of Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham. Liverpool donated {{the share of the}} money they would have received for the game. Within days donations had passed £1million, swelled by donations from individuals, schools and businesses. <b>Other</b> <b>fund</b> raising activities included a Factory Records benefit concert and several fundraising football matches. Bradford City and Lincoln City, the teams involved in the Bradford City stadium fire, {{met for the first time}} since the 1985 disaster in a game which raised £25,000. When the appeal closed the following year, it had raised over £12million. Much of the money went to victims and relatives of those involved in the disaster and provided funds for a college course to improve the hospital phase of emergency care.|$|E

2500|$|One key {{result of}} the above {{analysis}} is the two mutual fund theorem. [...] This theorem states that any portfolio on the efficient frontier can be generated by holding a combination of any two given portfolios on the frontier; the latter two given portfolios are the [...] "mutual funds" [...] in the theorem's name. [...] So {{in the absence of}} a risk-free asset, an investor can achieve any desired efficient portfolio even if all that is accessible is a pair of efficient mutual funds. If the location of the desired portfolio on the frontier is between the locations of the two mutual funds, both mutual funds will be held in positive quantities. If the desired portfolio is outside the range spanned by the two mutual funds, then one of the mutual funds must be sold short (held in negative quantity) while the size of the investment in the other mutual fund must be greater than the amount available for investment (the excess being funded by the borrowing from the <b>other</b> <b>fund).</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{servants}} having formed {{this plan}} of trade, {{and a new}} commission {{for the conduct of}} it, on their private account, {{it is a matter of}} consideration to know who the commissioners are. They turn out to be the three senior servants of the Company's Board of Trade, who choose to take upon them to be the factors of others for large emoluments, whilst they receive salaries of two thousand pounds and fifteen hundred pounds a year from the Company. As the Company have no <b>other</b> <b>fund</b> than the new investment from whence they are to be paid for the care of their servants' property, this commission and those salaries being to take place of their brokerage, they in effect render it very difficult, if not impossible, for them to derive advantage from their new occupation.|$|E

60|$|The governor, {{who had no}} <b>other</b> <b>fund,</b> {{was ready}} to lose courage, when Xavier, by a certain impulse of spirit, {{suddenly}} began to embrace seven sea captains there present, who were {{of the council of}} war. He begged of them to divide the business amongst them, and each of them apart to take care of fitting out one galley: At the same time, without waiting for their answer, he assigned every man his task. The captains durst not oppose Xavier, or rather God, who inclined their hearts to comply with the saint's request. Above an hundred workmen were instantly employed on every vessel; and in four days time the seven gallies were in condition for fighting. Melo gave the catur to Andrea Toscano, a man of courage, and well versed in sea affairs. He divided amongst the seven captains an hundred and fourscore soldiers, chosen men, and appointed Francis Deza admiral of the fleet. Xavier was desirous to have gone along with them, but the inhabitants, who believed all was lost if they lost the Father, and who hoped for no consolation but from him alone in case the enterprize should not succeed, made such a disturbance about it, that, upon mature deliberation, it was resolved to keep him in the town.|$|E
60|$|Ireland, {{before the}} English conquest, [Footnote: 46] though never {{governed by a}} despotic power, had no Parliament. How far the English Parliament itself {{was at that time}} {{modelled}} according to the present form is disputed among antiquaries; but we have all the reason in the world to be assured that a form of Parliament such as England then enjoyed she instantly communicated to Ireland, and we are equally sure that almost every successive improvement in constitutional liberty, as fast as it was made here, was transmitted thither. The feudal baronage and the feudal knighthood, the roots of our primitive Constitution, were early transplanted into that soil, and grew and flourished there. Magna Charta, if it did not give us originally the House of Commons, gave us at least a House of Commons of weight and consequence. But your ancestors did not churlishly sit down alone to the feast of Magna Charta. Ireland was made immediately a partaker. This benefit of English laws and liberties, I confess, was not at first extended to all Ireland. Mark the consequence. English authority and English liberties had exactly the same boundaries. Your standard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges. Sir John Davis shows beyond a doubt that the refusal of a general communication of these rights was the true cause why Ireland was five hundred years in subduing; and after the vain projects of a military government, attempted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was soon discovered that nothing could make that country English, in civility and allegiance, but your laws and your forms of legislature. It was not English arms, but the English Constitution, that conquered Ireland. From that time Ireland has ever had a general Parliament, as she had before a partial Parliament. You changed the people; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the vital substance of free government in that kingdom. You deposed kings; [Footnote: 47] you restored them; you altered the succession to theirs, as well as to your own Crown; but you never altered their Constitution, the principle of which was respected by usurpation, restored with the restoration of monarchy, and established, I trust, forever, by the glorious Revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flourishing kingdom that it is, and, from a disgrace and a burthen intolerable to this nation, has rendered her a principal part of our strength and ornament. This country cannot be said to have ever formally taxed her. The irregular things done in the confusion of mighty troubles and on the hinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that {{is said to have been}} done, form no example. If they have any effect in argument, they make an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could stand a moment, if the casual deviations from them at such times were suffered to be used as proofs of their nullity. By the lucrative amount of such casual breaches in the Constitution, judge what the stated and fixed rule of supply has been in that kingdom. Your Irish pensioners would starve, if they had no <b>other</b> <b>fund</b> to live on than taxes granted by English authority. Turn your eyes to those popular grants from whence all your great supplies are come, and learn to respect that only source of public wealth in the British Empire.|$|E
