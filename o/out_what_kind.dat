500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, and found myself trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of thematic connections I could make using {{the notion of the}} body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Charlotte are Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, and Charlotte {{is the second}} original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! (2010). Hironori Toba of Aniplex approached Maeda in early 2012 with an offer from P.A.Works president Kenji Horikawa to do another anime series with the studio. Maeda was surprised by this, as he never expected to work with P.A.Works again. Horikawa explained that the production staff could now handle things that {{were not able to}} be fully materialized during the production of Angel Beats!. Maeda did not think he would ever be involved in the planning of another anime series, but {{he said that he had}} no choice but to accept Horikawa's offer after discussing it with him. Toba asked Maeda to write a [...] "Key-like story", and Maeda started out by applying his prior experience of working on Angel Beats!. He went through a trial-and-error process to work <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of setting and story would work well for an anime series.|$|E

However, Norville takes the opportunity to pitch an invention he's been working on {{which turns out to}} be a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, [...] "you know, for kids."

500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} what would become Annie Hall was {{developed}} as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project on alternate days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on {{a man in his}} forties, someone whose life consisted [...] "of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that [...] "advancing age" [...] and [...] "worries about death" [...] had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his [...] "commercial side". Allen made the conscious decision to [...] "sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings". He recognized {{that for the first time}} he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama 8Â½, created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.|$|E

500|$|Songs {{featured}} within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] {{were taken}} from both the Los Angeles punk rock scene and mainstream 1980s hits in order to represent the two worlds surrounding character Lily Rhodes. [...] "Jumping between these two worlds {{is important to the}} show. Lily is living with her sister in the Valley and kind of hanging out in the punk rock scene, but she and her sister come from a wealthy family and their parents are more aligned with a Pacific Palisades/Beverly Hills/Malibu, Less Than Zero world. So her struggle... is to try and figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> of world she wants to be in", says Savage. Music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas oversaw music selection for the episode. With the exception of Fountains of Wayne's [...] "Prom Theme" [...] (1999), every song featured within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] was released prior to or in 1983, the year in which Lily's flashbacks take place. Savage explains that the show makers hoped to introduce modern audiences to bands and music they had not known before. No Doubt makes an uncredited guest appearance during the episode as a fictional band called [...] "Snowed Out", a play on words of [...] "No Doubt". During the cameo, part of the band's return to music after a four-year hiatus, No Doubt premiered their cover of Adam and the Ants' [...] "Stand and Deliver", the band's first new song in five years. The band performs in the Sunset Strip club where Lily meets Carol {{for the first time in}} a year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new trend}} in runtime system {{monitoring}} is to utilize MOF-based techniques {{in analyzing the}} runtime system data. Approaches and tools have been proposed to automatically reflect the system data as MOF compliant models, but they all require users to manually build the meta-models that define the types and relations of the system data. To do this, users {{have to understand the}} different management APIs provided by different systems, and find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> of data can be obtained from them. In this paper, we present an automated approach to inferring such meta-models by analyzing client code that accesses man-agement APIs.
