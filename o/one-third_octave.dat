50|$|Analyzing {{a source}} on a {{frequency}} by frequency basis is possible but time consuming. The whole frequency range {{is divided into}} sets of frequencies called bands. Each band covers a specific range of frequencies. For this reason, a scale of octave bands and <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands has been developed. A band {{is said to be}} an octave in width when the upper band frequency is twice the lower band frequency. A <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band is defined as a frequency band whose upper band-edge frequency (f2) is the lower band frequency (f1) times the cube root of two.|$|E
50|$|The average range, therefore, {{is about}} three-and-a-half octaves, with the exact range {{depending}} {{on the number of}} frets on the individual instrument: from about one and <b>one-third</b> <b>octaves</b> below middle C up to A#5/Bb5, in the octave above middle C, (with 18 frets), to as high as E6, with 24 frets.|$|R

This report discusses the theory of the source of electromagnetic noise, the propagation of this noise to an observation point above a mine, and its interaction with the local earth conductivity structure, which gives rise to vertical magnetic noise. The relationship of surface noise to underground noise is also discussed. Bureau of Mines investigators made surface and underground vertical magnetic noise measurements at a number of coal mines located through- out the United States. These data were modeled through regression analysis to characterize expected noise levels.

50|$|NRC {{is being}} {{replaced}} by the Sound Absorption Average (SAA), which is described in the current ASTM C423-09a. The SAA is a single-number rating of sound absorption properties of a material similar to NRC, except that the sound absorption values employed in the averaging are taken at the twelve <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands from 200 Hz to 2500 Hz, inclusive, and rounding is to the nearest multiple of 0.01.|$|E
5000|$|NRC is {{intended}} to be a simplified acoustical rating of room construction and finish materials when the acoustical objectives of the space are less than sensitive. In certain applications, such as designs of music rehearsal rooms, performance spaces, and rooms employed for critical speech, it is usually more appropriate to consider the sound absorption coefficients at the individual <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band frequencies, including those above and below the bands used to compute NRC.|$|E
40|$|Distortion-product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) {{were measured}} as level∕phase (L∕P) maps in humans, rabbits, chinchillas, and rats {{with and without}} an interference tone (IT) placed either near the 2 f 1 −f 2 DPOAE frequency place (fdp) or at <b>one-third</b> of an <b>octave</b> above the f 2 primary tone (1 ∕ 3 -oct IT). Vector differences between with and without IT conditions were computed to derive a residual composed of the DPOAE components removed by the IT. In humans, a DPOAE component could be extracted with the expected steep phase gradient indicative of reflection emissions by ITs near fdp. In the laboratory species, ITs near fdp failed to produce any conclusive evidence for reflection components. For all species, 1 ∕ 3 -oct ITs extracted large DPOAE components presumably generated at or basal to the IT-frequency place that exhibited both distortion- and reflection-like phase properties. Together, these findings suggested that basal distortion components could assume reflection-like phase behavior when the assumptions of cochlear-scaling symmetry, the basis for shallow phase gradients for constant f 2 ∕f 1 ratio sweeps, are violated. The present results contradict the common belief that DPOAE components associated with steep or shallow phase slopes are unique signatures for reflection emissions arising from fdp or distortion emissions generated near f 2, respectively...|$|R

For normal masking systems, the acoustical version is used. For secure facilities, where speech may be in vibration form, the second method must be used. To collect the necessary data, a <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band Real Time Analyzer with a random incidence microphone is necessary. To create the test sound, a source with directional characteristics {{similar to that of the}} human voice is necessary. A tripod should be used to mount the sound source which is normally 48 inches high for seated talkers.|$|E

The absorption coefficients of materials are commonly determined through use of standardized testing procedures, such as ASTM C423 {{that is used to}} evaluate the absorption of materials in eighteen <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> frequency bands with center frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 5000 Hz. Absorption coefficients used to calculate NRC are commonly determined in reverberation rooms of qualified acoustical laboratory test facilities using samples of the particular materials of specified size and appropriate mounting.|$|E

Noise reduction was obtained for the case of random acoustic excitation in a diffuse field; the frequency range of interest was 100 - 800 -Hz <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands. The measured data were compared with noise reduction predictions from the Propeller Aircraft Interior Noise (PAIN) program and from a statistical energy analysis.

30|$|In {{designing}} the modulation spectrum analysis system, {{a number of}} decisions {{had to be made}} about implementation details. Although we are confident that all our decisions were reasonable (and supported by data from the literature), we cannot claim that they were optimal. Most data in the literature on modulation spectra are based on perception experiments with human subjects, {{but more often than not}} these experiments use auditory stimuli that are very different from speech. While the results of those experiments surely provide guidance for ASR, it may well be that the automatic processing aimed at extracting the discriminative information is so different from what humans do that some of our decisions are sub-optimal. Our gammatone filterbank contains 15 <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filters, which have a higher resolution in the frequencies < 500 Hz than the Mel filterbank that is used in most ASR systems. However, initial experiments in which we compared our <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filterbank with a filterbank consisting of 23 Mel-spaced gammatone filters, spanning the frequency range of 64 to 3, 340 Hz did not show a significant advantage of the latter over the former. From the speech technology’s point of view, this may seem surprising because the narrow-band filters of the <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filterbank in the low frequencies may cause interactions with fundamental frequency, while the relatively broad filters in the higher frequencies cannot resolve formants. But from an auditory system’s point of view, there is no such surprise, since <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filters are compatible with most, if not all, outcomes of psycho-acoustic experiments. This is also true for experiments that focused on speech intelligibility [1].|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaximum sound {{pressure}} levels {{are commonly used}} for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with octave band filters, <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band filters or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for octave band filters, and when Bt≈ 3 for <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band filters. Four different commercially-available sound level meters are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 {{the noise}} {{generating}} capabilities in the reverberation {{chamber of the}} Structural Acoustic Loads and Transmission (SALT) facility at NASA Langley Research Center were enhanced with two fiberglass reinforced polyester resin exponential horns, each coupled to Wyle Acoustic Source WAS- 3000 airstream modulators. This report describes the characterization of the reverberation chamber {{in terms of the}} background noise, diffusivity, sound pressure levels, the reverberation times and the related overall acoustic absorption in the empty chamber and with the acoustic horn(s) installed. The frequency range of interest includes the 80 Hz to 8000 Hz <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands. Reverberation time and sound pressure level measurements were conducted and standard deviations from the mean were computed. It was concluded that a diffuse field could be produced above the Schroeder frequency in the 400 Hz <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band and higher for all applications. This frequency could be lowered by installing panel diffusers or moving vanes to improve the acoustic modal overlap in the chamber. In the 80 Hz to 400 Hz <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> bands a successful measurement will be dependent on the type of measurement, the test configuration, the source and microphone locations and the desired accuracy.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the use of a}} {{modulation}} spectrum front end that is based on time-domain filtering that does not require collapsing the output to the equivalent of <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filters, but which still makes it possible to estimate the posterior probability of the states in a finite-state machine. In brief, we first filter the speech signal with 15 gammatone filters (roughly equivalent to <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> filters) and we process the Hilbert envelope of the output of the gammatone filters with nine modulation spectrum filters [19]. The 135 -dimensional (135 -D) output of this system can be sampled at any rate that is an integer fraction of the sampling frequency of the input speech signal. For the conversion of the 135 -D output to posterior probability estimates of a set of states, we use the sparse coding (SC) approach proposed by [20]. Sparse coding is best conceived of as an exemplar-based approach [21] in which unknown inputs are coded as positive (weighted) sums of items in an exemplar dictionary.|$|E

This work aims to perform the receiver tests regarding the radiated noise and structural vibration due to the compressor in different operating conditions. The sound pressure near the compressor is recorded by the <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> and narrow band frequency analyzers, respectively. For environmental concern, the <b>one-third</b> <b>octave</b> band spectrum is frequently adopted to evaluate the radiated noise, while the narrow band spectrum {{can be used to}} characterize the noise sources. The axial, vertical and horizontal accelerations on the compressor shell at the motor and oil-injection locations are also monitored to correlate the structure-borne noise. Other than the comparison of spectral content between radiated noise and compressor shell vibration, the frequency response functions and the coherence functions are examined to further characterize the relation between noise and vibration. This work lays out the general steps and measurement procedures for noise and vibration evaluation in primary stage for receiver tests considering different load capacities.

40|$|Transmission losses (TL) {{to highly}} {{impulsive}} signals generated by three firearms have been measured for two ear muffs, using both a head and torso simulator and a miniature microphone {{located at the}} ear canal entrance (MIRE technique). Peak SPL TL {{have been found to}} be well approximated by 40 ms short-L eq TL. This has allowed the use of transmissibilities and correction factors for bone conduction and physiological masking appropriate for continuous noise, for the calculation of REAT-type peak insertion losses (IL).
