500|$|In {{addition}} {{to issues of}} Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau [...] "talked so beautifully of needing {{to meet the requirements}} of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people...and yet he has betrayed every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> committed to in Paris." ...|$|E

500|$|Mankiewicz {{had thought}} of turning Solitaire into a black woman, with Diana Ross as his primary choice. However, Broccoli and Saltzman decided to stick to Fleming's {{description}} of a white woman, and after thinking of Catherine Deneuve, Jane Seymour, {{who was in the}} TV series The Onedin Line, was cast for the role. Yaphet Kotto was cast while doing another movie for United Artists, Across 110th Street. Kotto reported <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> liked in the role was Kananga's interest in the occult, [...] "feeling like he can control past, present and future".|$|E
500|$|Both men {{are portrayed}} as very incompetent, in [...] "Nob and Nobility", it takes Prince George a week {{to put on a}} pair of {{trousers}} by himself, eventually putting them on his head. George relies heavily on Blackadder in the third (Mr. E. Blackadder) series, even while Blackadder despises George for his immense wealth and complete inability to rectify problems in his life. While George is considered [...] "moronic" [...] and [...] "idiotic", he is helpful, loyal, and is aware he is not very intelligent, describing himself as [...] "thick as a whale omelette". In a 2008 retrospective, co-star Stephen Fry said George's keenness for self-improvement was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> felt made the character likeable. In [...] "Duel and Duality," [...] the final episode of the third series, after a sexual encounter with the Duke of Wellington's nieces, this princely incarnation of George is struck by a point-blank shot from the vengeful Wellington's pistol and killed. George briefly awakes, believing that he may have a cigarillo case on him that deflected the blow, but when he realises that he must have left the case at home, promptly falls dead again in Baldrick's arms.|$|E

Horne told a friend that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> could do for the Navy was to keep King under control, while King admired Horne's intelligence and administrative skill but distrusted his ambition. [...] "Horne was a [...] ", King mused later, [...] "but a very able man all the same... I have never liked him and never knew why." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Faith, {{the writers}} {{explored}} {{the nature of}} power, and the boundaries and consequences of its use. They wanted {{to address the issue}} that, whether the creatures a Slayer kills are good or evil, she is still a professional killer. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, and writer of Faith-centric episodes such as [...] "Revelations" [...] and [...] "Bad Girls", says <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> loves about the character is that Faith is not wrong in describing herself and Buffy as killers. He goes on to discuss a Slayer's rights and responsibilities, and how Faith believes her contributions to society relieve her of any legal or moral responsibilities, a view which Buffy does not share. When writing Faith, Petrie looked to Frank Miller's violent Marvel Comics character Elektra Natchios for inspiration, claiming, [...] "In a different, teen, punkier context, Faith is so much like Elektra." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{he served}} in the Sistine Chapel choir until at least 1499, during the papacies of Innocent VIII and Alexander VI, he began to acquire other posts and benefices. [...] He was {{particularly}} popular with Innocent, who awarded him benefices and allowed him to rise in the hierarchy in spite of his illegitimacy. [...] During this time he and Josquin worked closely together, even seeking similar positions at Cambrai in their mutual homeland. [...] <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> may have done in collaboration with Josquin was a revision of a cycle of hymns by Guillaume Dufay, composed around 1430, which had fallen out of use. [...] At some time in the early 1490s Orto acquired the post of dean at the Collegiate Church of St. Gertrude of Nivelles, present-day Belgium; he was to remain closely associated with this institution {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] It is not known exactly when he moved there, but he left Nivelles in late 1504 in order to join the choir of Philip the Handsome, la Grande Chapelle, a distinguished musical body which included Pierre de La Rue, and which went to Spain in 1506.|$|E
2500|$|This season {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of red kryptonite. In the fourth episode of the second season, titled [...] "Red", Clark buys a high school ring that contains a red kryptonite gem. The effects of the kryptonite were meant {{to act as a}} metaphor for drugs. Loeb was given the task of writing [...] "Red" [...] by Gough and Millar, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> decided on was that the ultimate pay off with the kryptonite would be Clark finally kissing Lana. As Tom Welling describes it, [...] "With 'Red Clark' he's completely aware of the consequences of his actions at the time, but he doesn't care! He doesn't care what happens to you, and he certainly doesn't care what happens to himself, because he probably realizes that nothing can happen to him. It's always fun to be that way, even in real life, because we're not allowed to be that way all too often." [...] One of the concerns for the episode was whether the audience would embrace the idea of a [...] "bad Clark", as Ken Biller knew that Clark would have to be [...] "the villain of the story". Fortunately, audiences did embrace the idea and after the good ratings [...] "Red" [...] received, the WB requested more episodes with red kryptonite. Unfortunately, Gough and the crew did not like using it because of the idea of [...] "Clark [...] bad", but the team asked themselves, [...] "what if a friend slips something in your drink and you don’t know it?" [...] This became the basis in [...] "Rush", where Pete slips a shard of red kryptonite into Clark's pocket; it also gave the network what they wanted, but {{in the form of a}} single act instead of the entire episode. This element would show up again in the season finale, when Clark slips on another red kryptonite ring before riding out of Smallville on a motorcycle. According to Ken Biller, the moment Clark goes searching for the kryptonite is the payoff they had wanted with that piece of Superman mythology. The show had established that red kryptonite removes Clark's inhibitions, and in the season finale, Clark is to the point that he is willing to [...] "go 'on drugs' to solve his own pain and [...] guilt about what he's done".|$|E
