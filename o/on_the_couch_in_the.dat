25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them {{down the hall to}} Hardwick’s room. The door was open and the officers observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.|$|E

Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music.|$|E

500|$|... "Blown Away" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A reviewer for Billboard thought that Mark Bright's [...] "brooding, atmospheric" [...] production and Underwood's vocal performance [...] "elevate this cinematic tune to an instant classic." [...] They further commented, [...] "When the girl shuts {{herself in the}} storm cellar, leaving her alcoholic father passed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of a twister, you can almost feel the wind." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed {{the description of the}} album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post gave the song a mixed review, deeming the lyrics as [...] "gripping", but negatively comparing the instrumentation to the work of Taylor Swift.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

60|$|Two {{hours later}} a step was heard {{coming down the}} garden, and a woman came and lit some lamps in the pavilion, and again retired.

60|$|Then he {{felt himself}} leaning on two brawny arms. His feet {{followed}} the mesmeric influence of their movement. Was he going into the clouds, he wondered?

There were voices. He listened. The one voice? The one face bending over his, her eyes wet with tears, her whispers an incoherent stream of broken words. Then the warmth seemed {{to come back to}} his veins. He sat up and found himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library, the rain dripping from him in little pools, and he knew that he had succeeded. He had not fainted.|$|E
60|$|Sentimentally she did {{not much}} care to see him--his delays had wearied her, but it was necessary; and with a sigh she {{arranged}} herself picturesquely in the chair; first this way, then that; next so that the light fell over her head. Next she flung herself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cyma-recta curve which so became her, and with her arm over her brow looked towards the door. This, she decided, was the best position after all, and thus she remained till a man's step was heard on the stairs.

6000|$|... "First, we had {{for some}} days fared {{exceedingly}} hard, and suffered very great hunger; {{but at last}} we were wholly without food of any kind except sugar, and a little wine and water. The first day after I had received no food at all, I found myself towards evening, empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to yawning and sleep. I lay down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed, having taken {{a glass of wine}} when I lay down; after being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thus I continued all the second day with a strange variety--first hungry, then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, being obliged to go to bed again without any food more than a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach was full after this, as it would have been after a good dinner; but when I awaked I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity of family. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not my understanding returned and conquered it, whether if I had been a mother, and had had a little child with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted about three hours, during which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he can now inform you.|$|E
