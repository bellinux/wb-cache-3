5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic.</b> Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E

5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic,</b> when more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Black Death forced Louis to leave Italy in May. He made Ulrich Wolfhardt {{governor}} of Naples, but his mercenaries did not hinder Joanna I and her husband from returning in September. Louis, who had signed a truce for eight years with Venice on 5 August, sent new troops to Naples {{under the command of}} Stephen Lackfi, Voivode of Transylvania, in late 1349. Lackfi reoccupied Capua, Aversa and other forts that had been lost to Joanna I, but a mutiny among his German mercenaries forced him to return to Hungary. The Black Death had meanwhile reached Hungary. The first wave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> ended in June, but it returned in September, killing Louis's first wife, Margaret. Louis also fell ill, but survived the plague. Although the Black Death was less devastating in the sparsely populated Hungary than in other parts of Europe, there were regions that became depopulated in 1349, and the demand for work force increased in the subsequent years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{studies suggest}} that air-transportation {{networks}} contribute a lot to <b>the</b> spatiotemporal dynamics <b>of</b> infectious diseases. <b>The</b> mobility <b>of</b> individuals over <b>the</b> networks has greatly speeded up <b>the</b> spreading processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemics</b> and pushed <b>the</b> population in non-epidemic areas into <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> infection. To figure out the underlying interactions between the air-transportation networks and <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemics,</b> we have (i) analyzed the air-routes and the statistical data on <b>the</b> passenger throughput <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil aviation <b>of</b> China and (ii) carried out a computer simulation {{based on the assumption}} that a novel influenza outbreaks in Southeast Asia. The results show that <b>the</b> topology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air-transportations networks has a typical structure of heterogeneities. We also find that <b>the</b> <b>epidemics</b> will soon strike China after the initial outbreaks and rapidly spread throughout the whole networks without air-travel restrictions even the reproductive number (0 R) is small...|$|R
