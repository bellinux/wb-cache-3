5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage <b>of</b> <b>puberty),</b> and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E
5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school {{who wants to be}} a boy, but she realized that a boy {{who wants to be a}} girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years past the age <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> of the son. In Solon's laws, {{it appears that the}} eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

40|$|Precocious puberty poses {{significant}} {{diagnostic and}} therapeutic {{challenge to the}} physician. Recent advances {{in the understanding of}} pathophysiology <b>of</b> precocious <b>puberty</b> have resulted in improved management. Timely intervention is mandatory to achieve successful outcome. The identification of critical role of KISS- 1 -kisspeptin-GPR 54 system has gone a long way to provide an insight into pubertal physiology. It is likely that the system would become an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in children with precocious puberty. Epidemiological studies point toward earlier thelarche. This is, however, associated with slower progression as the age of menarche is static. These changes have led to suggestions of lowering the age cutoffs for precocious puberty in girls. New developments in assessment <b>of</b> precocious <b>puberty</b> including gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist test have made characterization <b>of</b> precocious <b>puberty</b> easier. Longstanding GnRH analogs have become the mainstay of treatment <b>of</b> gonadotropin-dependent precocious <b>puberty,</b> while aromatase inhibitors and inhibitors of sex hormone action are increasingly being used in gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty...|$|R

25|$|The {{definition}} of the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.).

50|$|Children who {{are healthy}} {{but have a}} slower rate of {{physical}} development than average have constitutional delay <b>of</b> growth and <b>puberty.</b> These children {{have a history of}} stature shorter than their age-matched peers throughout childhood, but their height is appropriate for bone age, and skeletal development is delayed more than 2.5 SD. They usually are thin and often have a family history <b>of</b> delayed <b>puberty.</b> Children with a combination of a family tendency toward short stature and constitutional delay <b>of</b> growth and <b>puberty</b> are the most likely to seek evaluation.

25|$|Although {{there is}} a wide range of normal ages, girls {{typically}} begin the process <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> at age 10 or 11; boys at ages 11–12. Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15–17, while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16–17. Girls attain reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> appear. In contrast, boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes. Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.|$|E
25|$|In boys, {{testicular}} enlargement is {{the first}} physical manifestation <b>of</b> <b>puberty</b> (and is termed gonadarche). Testes in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> averaging about 2–3cm in length and about 1.5–2cm in width. The size of the testicles is among {{the parameters of the}} Tanner scale for male genitals, from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty.</b> After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the penis will increase and the glans penis and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions.

25|$|The Tanner scale {{looks at}} the {{development}} of pubic hair. Before the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> the genital area of {{both boys and girls}} has very fine vellus hair (stage 1). At the onset <b>of</b> <b>puberty,</b> the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones, and in response, the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher, often curlier, hair with a faster growth rate. The onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche. The change for each hair follicle is relatively abrupt, but the extent of skin which grows androgenic hair gradually increases over several years.|$|E
