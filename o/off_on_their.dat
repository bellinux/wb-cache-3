5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones. The team is composed of Juno, Vela, and their wardog mascot Lupus. The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet Goldwood after barely escaping {{the destruction of the}} entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar, who has been capturing and enslaving a race of survivors known as the Tribals. When Juno, Vela and Lupus are attacked by several drones, the three decide to abandon their ship and go <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own separate paths to stop the invasion. Ultimately, the heroes find themselves reunited at Mizar's Palace and face to face with Mizar, who escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth. To help the heroes, Tribals leader King Jeff provides them with an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar's asteroid. In return, the team must rescue all the Tribals throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{counseling}} {{kids and}} teenagers with drug advice, Kilroy's parents also advise {{young people who}} plan to travel for spring break. They advise people to stay in groups, {{keep an eye on}} each other, and not wander <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own. They also suggest tourists to be aware of travel warnings and abide by foreign laws and regulations when they travel outside the U.S., though they reiterated that people can get hurt in the U.S. too.|$|E
25|$|While Sheridan's {{men were}} <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> raid, Grant's army had begun moving from Cold Harbor {{to cross the}} James River. In {{conjunction}} with this move, Grant ordered that his principal supply base be moved from White House on the Pamunkey River to City Point on the James. Sheridan learned that the White House depot {{had not yet been}} broken up, so he sent his wounded, prisoners, and African-Americans who had been following his column, to White House under escort on June 19, and then marched back to Dunkirk, where he could cross the Mattaponi.|$|E

25|$|Breeding {{occurs in}} the spring when males follow the {{pheromone}} trails of the females. Copulation can sometimes last for hours and happen multiple times {{over a period of}} days. After mating, the male often stays near the female for several days to prevent any other males from mating with her. The female gives birth to live young in the summer, and the babies stay with the mother only until they wander <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own, usually less than a day or two. Females are believed to breed every year, and can have litters as large as 10-12 young, but usually average four to six. Their lifespans average 15–20 years.|$|E
25|$|Head of Training Center problems. After {{demotion}} of Colonel Karpov, {{the first}} head of Cosmonaut Training Center, Kamanin initially supported nomination of General Odintsov. Odintsov was approved 5 April 1963, {{and in a}} few weeks proved himself completely incompetent to the task - a view allegedly supported by Korolyov and Marshal Rudenko. 17 July AirForce Military Council dismissed Odintsov; Kamanin campaigned to nominate 29-year-old Yuri Gagarin, but was stonewalled by his superiors Vershinin and Rudenko. However, in September Rodion Malinovsky reinstalled Odintsov; the situation normalized in November 1963 with appointment of General Nikolai Kuznetsov. After the death of Gagarin, Kamanin (himself ultimately responsible for all cosmonaut training) blamed Kuznetsov for a sequence of errors that allowed Gagarin and Seregin to take <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fatal flight. Replacing Kuznetsov, again, became a long bureaucratic struggle.|$|E
25|$|By 1494, the Milan {{branch of}} the Medici bank also ceased to exist. The {{branches}} that did not die <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own generally met their end {{with the collapse of}} the Medicis' political power in Florence in 1494, when Savonarola and the Pope struck against them. The central Florentine banco was burned by a mob, the Lyons branch was taken over by a rival firm, and the Roman branch struck off on its own despite the branch being bankrupt in general (ironically, they would suffer still more debts when a Medici cardinal became Pope Leo X) and inquired after the 11,243 gold florins he had deposited with the branch back when it was with the Medici bank). Even at the time of its downfall, the Medici bank was the biggest bank in Europe, with at least seven branches and over fifty factors.|$|E

25|$|Among Native Hawaiians, {{the goal}} of {{learning}} is to transform participation to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community, like that found in LOPI. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to Indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed {{in case of a}} tragic incident with the parents. Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E

Towards the end of April till mid May they toured through Australia and New Zealand before returning to Europe for a show in Germany on May 29 and the following day in Vienna then in Budapest. On June 2 they played at Ahoy Rotterdam followed by 4 performances in Germany from June 3 – 7 {{and one in the}} Czech Republic on June 20.

However, when technical glitches prevent the team from setting <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> mission, they are stuck in the briefing room under the orders of General Landry (Beau Bridges), because the Pentagon believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel {{will serve as a}} good cover story to keep the real Stargate program a secret.|$|E

Danny brings the upsetting article to Jack, but Jack quickly figures out that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are the ones behind it. To get back at them, Jack and Danny trick them into stripping {{in front of the}} TGS dancers. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz, however, discover a secret code from a prank society that Jack belonged to while attending Princeton University.

500|$|Another spirit {{reportedly}} haunts the Omni Shoreham Hotel (2500 Calvert Street NW), {{built in}} 1930 by local construction company owner Harry Bralove and designed by Waddy Butler Wood. The hotel's owners accepted Henry L. Doherty {{as a minority}} financial partner. Doherty and his family moved into an apartment (now Suite 870) in the hotel, along with their maid, Juliette Brown. A {{few months after the}} Dohertys moved into the apartment, their maid died in the night. A short time later, the Doherty's daughter, Helen, also died in the suite. The Dohertys moved out, and the apartment remained unoccupied for almost 50 years. The apartment was renovated into a hotel suite. But guests and hotel staff began to tell stories of faint voices, cold breezes, doors slamming shut and opening of their own accord, and televisions and lights turning on and <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own. Guests in adjoining suites would complain of noises coming from the closed and empty Suite 870. Other occupants say furniture would be found out of place, and hotel staff said their housekeeping carts would move on their own. The Omni Shoreham Hotel has named the room the [...] "Ghost Suite." [...] Todd Scartozzi, an Omni Hotels manager, stayed in the Ghost Suite with his family and observed a walk-in closet light turning on and off of its own accord.|$|E
500|$|The National Trust {{states that}} Newton House is [...] "thought {{to be one}} of the most haunted houses in Britain", and Wales Online cites it as one of the most notable ghostly houses of Wales. Over the years, many ghost {{sightings}} or paranormal activity have been allegedly witnessed at the house. The servants' basement is one of the purported centres of activity, with numerous sightings, particularly of a ghost known as Walter the Butler who worked at the house. People have reported smelling his tobacco smoke in the room, muffled voices and lights eerily turning on and <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own accord. Visitors have reported feeling as if they are being choked when walking up and down the cantilever staircase; this is believed to be related to the strangling of Lady Elinor Cavendish, the cousin of the lady of Newton House in the 1720s, by a lover whom she had rejected. The alleged hauntings at the property began to be investigated by television journalists in the 1980s, and on one occasion crewmen mysteriously fell ill one after the other while shooting there. During one investigation, the spectre of a young, beautiful girl was said to have glided across the room and disappeared through the cupboard door. The house was later the subject of an investigation in the 11th and 15th series of the Most Haunted programme.|$|E

[...] When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the [...] "kind, sensitive way" [...] Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, [...] "Max begins to realise there's more to her than her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends." [...] Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> wedding day, as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and [...] "such an awful thing to happen to Steph", until she received [...] "amazing feedback" [...] about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent [...] "what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss."
