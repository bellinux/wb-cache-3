For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, a janitor, who {{was also}} a student, {{borrowed}} a book from the library, to read during breaks. The book was Notre Dame vs the Klan, a historical account of how the then-despised Catholic minority in 1924, confronted the then-powerful Ku Klux Klan. The book jacket portrayed the hooded Klansmen. A co-worker complained after seeing the cover, as did his union supervisor. Eventually the school's Affirmative Action Officer issued a formal rebuke to the janitor. After much discussion and criticism she backed away from that rebuke and subsequently retired. After more criticism and a passage of several months, the university chancellor apologized and issued letters <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> to the original complainant.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, took a {{personal}} interest in the anti-Soap Trust campaign. While extending assurances of “the strictest impartiality” to Lever, Northcliffe’s close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt revealed {{his support for the}} American’s activities as a 'trust-buster'. Roosevelt’s investigations of dishonest dealings among many American companies had been fully reported in Britain, eliciting a pious chorus <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> and claims that any similar wrongdoing by British firms would be unimaginable. But Northcliffe, pointing to the existence of a British Tobacco Trust, was not convinced. He set in motion a campaign of investigative journalism, some of which seems to have verged upon persecution; the clear objective of which was to smash Lever’s soap combine.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the public}} {{statement}} <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> from the AAA, and significant {{media coverage of}} the controversy surrounding HTS, the United States Congress issued an order for an independent assessment of HTS to be undertaken by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in September 2009. In May 2010, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS, was completed in October 2010. It was subsequently published on the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) website in February 2011, but withdrawn from the website shortly after.|$|E

In 1916 Kinsey was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated magna cum laude, with degrees in biology and psychology. Afred Seguine Kinsey did not attend his son's graduation ceremony from Bowdoin, possibly as another sign <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> of his son's choice of career and studies. Kinsey continued his graduate studies at Harvard University's Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under William Morton Wheeler, a scientist who made outstanding contributions to entomology. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.|$|E
25|$|The {{cornerstone}} laying {{occurred as}} scheduled on November 12. The turnout of about 6,000 people was, however, lighter than expected.

Speakers included former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and Hilary A. Herbert. On {{the spur of the}} moment, Herbert asked Corporal James R. Tanner, former Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic (a veterans organization for Union soldiers) to briefly address the crowd. Tanner lost both legs in the war, became a stenographer, and took eyewitness testimony on behalf of the government in the hours following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He had briefly led the Bureau of Pensions in 1889, and helped organize the American Red Cross. Nonetheless, there were murmurs <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> from the audience when Tanner spoke.|$|E

This public humiliation of her [...] "Lieutenant-General" [...] combined with her continued talks for a separate peace with Spain, irreversibly undermined his standing among the Dutch. The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth's repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester's own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led {{to the failure of}} the campaign. Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587.|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, we {{elaborate}} on <b>disapproval</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality in 20 European countries. We mainly {{focus on the}} explanation of differences in the <b>disapproval</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality at {{the individual and the}} national level. Data from four waves of the European Social Survey are used, using multilevel techniques to test our hypotheses. Individual differences in <b>disapproval</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality can be derived from theories of socializing agents (religious institutions, schools) and socializing circumstances as well as from psychological theories on conventionalism and tradition. We find that religious people, people who support conventionalism, and those who attach to traditions disapprove of homosexuality more, whereas highly educated people disapprove less. Differences between countries can be explained by socializing circumstances of the national context as the countries' religiosity and laws on homosexuality turned out to be important determinants <b>of</b> the <b>disapproval</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality. We found that <b>disapproval</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality is the least in countries where law permits homosexuals to marry. In addition, people who live in more religious countries disapprove of homosexuality more than people who live in secular countries. ...|$|R

One of the resulting suggestions was to terminate funding of the special forces as an expression <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> of Tung and Nhu's actions. Another was to run covert campaigns to discredit Tung. The Krulak–Mendenhall mission ended in a stalemate, so the Kennedy administration followed up with the McNamara–Taylor mission.

500|$|Various {{political}} regimes {{have sought}} to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because <b>of</b> <b>disapproval</b> of the music or clothes associated with it.
