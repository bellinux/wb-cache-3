5|$|Fleance {{appears in}} Shakespeare's Macbeth. However, only his {{childhood}} is portrayed; the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story,</b> {{as it is}} described in Holinshed's Chronicles, {{does not appear in}} Shakespeare's play. Scholars suggest that Shakespeare does not elaborate on Fleance's life after his escape from Scotland to avoid unnecessary distraction from the story of Macbeth himself.|$|E
5|$|Little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the character during the 18th and 19th centuries. However, Troilus has reappeared in 20th and 21st century retellings of the Trojan War by authors who have chosen elements from both the classical and medieval versions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|The town of Momchilgrad and {{the village}} of Momchilovtsi in {{southern}} Bulgaria, as well as Momchil Peak on Greenwich Island of the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica are named after Momchil. His life served {{as the basis for}} an opera piece, eponymously named Momchil and written by Bulgarian composer Lyubomir Pipkov. Momchil's biography also inspired a 1988 children's comic book, The Lord of Merope, which tells a largely fictionalised version <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} serial, Hergé planned to put {{together}} a story that caricatured the actions of Nazi Germany, developing the plot for King Ottokar's Sceptre. However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering Greenland or the Klondike as potential locations. The result was The Black Island, although Hergé only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a snowdrift on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of anarchists bent on destroying Europe's iconic buildings, but again this idea did not make it into the eventual story. Having decided to set most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> in Britain, Hergé briefly visited London and the southern English coast {{to learn more about the}} country. There, he purchased a stainless steel Gillotts Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an Anglophilia that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, many aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> were changed in their {{transition}} to film, {{such as the}} addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings {{about the end of the}} organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E
25|$|Though {{suspicious}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story,</b> in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 {{items to}} Gurlitt, including Max Liebermann's Two Riders On The Beach, Otto Dix's self-portrait, an allegorical painting by Marc Chagall.

25|$|Hellraiser is a British horror {{franchise}} {{that consists of}} ten films, a series of comic books, and additional merchandise and media.

The films, as well as the comic book series, continually feature the Cenobite Pinhead.|$|E
25|$|Lenz, a novella {{fragment}} by Georg Büchner, {{deals with}} Lenz's {{visit to the}} minister Friedrich Oberlin, in the Vosges. Lenz had visited Oberlin, on the suggestion of Kaufmann, because of {{his reputation as a}} pastor and psychologist.

25|$|Encouraged by the {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> and realising that clinical medicine {{would not leave}} him time to write, Ballard abandoned his medical studies, and in October 1951 he enrolled at Queen Mary College to read English Literature.

He kept writing short fiction but found it impossible to get published.|$|E
25|$|In the 12th century, Danish {{accounts}} by Saxo Grammaticus {{and other}} Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a euhemerized account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story.</b> Compiled in Iceland in the 13th century, {{but based on}} much older Old Norse poetry, the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda contain numerous references {{to the death of}} Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök. Although he was loved by all gods and more physical beings, he was so handsome, generous, and good that he gave off light simply by the purity of his character.|$|E
25|$|After a party, Samsara {{explains}} {{that she and}} Bodhi both knew Ono Ozaki when they were young, that her parents died in an avalanche accident and Ozaki gave her a home after. She explains further that Ozaki actually completed his third ordeal, despite what was widely believed. He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a whaling ship crashing into his boat while {{he was trying to}} save humpback whales. On his boat, a young boy, Bodhi, decided not to tell the truth <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> but to finish what Ozaki started.|$|E
