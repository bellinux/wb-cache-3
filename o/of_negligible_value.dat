50|$|In the {{physical}} sciences, mechanical energy {{is the sum}} of potential energy and kinetic energy. It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces the mechanical energy is constant. If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object is changed, the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well. In all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, like frictional forces, will be present, but often they are <b>of</b> <b>negligible</b> <b>values</b> and the mechanical energy's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation. In elastic collisions, the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions, some mechanical energy is converted into heat. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy (dissipation) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule.|$|R
40|$|Uniformisation[1, 2] {{is a key}} {{technique}} {{which allows}} modellers to extract passage-time quantiles/densities which in turn permits the plotting of probability density and cumulative distribution functions. Uniformisation converts a CTMC (Continuous-Time Markov Chain) into a DTMC (Discrete-Time Markov Chain) with equivalent semantics. This {{can be used to}} calculate the probability of completing a passage within a given time t by calculating the probability of completing the passage within a number of iterations, n, of the DTMC and then calculating the probability that the nth iteration is performed within time t. However to calculate the passage-time quantiles we desire we must theoretically perform this calculation for values of n from zero to infinity and sum the probabilities. This can be approximated by calculating for values of n from zero to some finite value if we know that larger values of n will yield negligible probabilities and hence add nothing significant to the summation. This paper discusses two important conditions which ensure that the approximation is appropriate while also reducing the amount <b>of</b> <b>negligible</b> <b>values</b> calculated. ...|$|R

5000|$|The ISO 4217 {{standard}} {{includes a}} crude mechanism for expressing {{the relationship between}} a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency [...] "exponent" [...] and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the United States dollar) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the [...] "cent". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is <b>of</b> such <b>negligible</b> <b>value</b> that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) equal to 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to <b>negligible</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

5000|$|After a Navy Court of Inquiry {{recommended}} that McVay be court-martialed {{for the loss}} of Indianapolis, Admiral Chester Nimitz disagreed and instead issued the captain a letter of reprimand. Admiral Ernest King overturned Nimitz’s decision and recommended a court-martial, which Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal later convened. McVay was charged with failing to zigzag and failure to order abandon ship in a timely manner. He was convicted on the former. Prior knowledge of Japanese submarines being identified in the area was withheld from the court and from McVay, prior to sailing, as well. Following McVay's conviction for hazarding Indianapolis by failing to zigzag, Admiral King recommended setting aside the punishment. Hashimoto, the Japanese submarine commander who had sunk the Indianapolis, was on record as describing visibility at the time as fair (which is corroborated {{by the fact that he}} was able to target and sink the Indianapolis in the first place).

When Mogohlwane tried to take back his bag, the deceased resisted and again threatened him with the tomahawk. Mogohlwane then stabbed him with the knife, causing his death. Mogohlwane was charged with murder. The court held that, in determining {{whether or not the}} property is of trivial value, it could be taken into account that the accused (as was the case in casu) might not be richly endowed with earthly possessions. What may be of little value to a wealthy person may be of great value to a poor person. Given Mogohlwane’s financial circumstances, the stolen items were of value to him. Mogohlwane was justified in his conduct, because his attempt to recover his property was close enough in time to the robbery {{to be part of the}} same chain of events. The State had not proved that there was a less dangerous and more effective means or method reasonably available to the accused to defend himself against the act of robbery, so it was decided that Mogohlwane had acted in private defence and therefore lawfully.|$|E

Although these burdens have many purported manifestations, one commonly cited is the risk of litigation, which may be borne both directly by the firm and/or its fiduciaries, or reflected in director and officer insurance premia funded at company expense. An important issue for the 2 ̆ 2 litigation risk 2 ̆ 2 justification of privatization is whether alternative (and less expensive) steps falling short of going private—such as governance reforms—may augur sufficiently against litigation exposure. In this Article, I consider whether, controlling for other variables related to firm-specific attributes, various measurable attributes of governance help to predict subsequent litigation exposure. Although there are some governance features (such as multiple board service, {{the presence of a}} staggered/classified board, institutional investing, and the proactive adoption of a governance policy) that predict subsequent liability exposure, most governance indicia appear to be <b>of</b> <b>negligible</b> predictive <b>value,</b> both statistically and economically.

[...] Vernon goes on to state that [...] "As a result of film which the investigators took just after Feldberg's eightyninth birthday, the Medical Research Council held an inquiry. The published report of the inquiry shows that according to the Medical Research Council Feldberg failed to ensure that four of the rabbits he used were sufficiently anaesthetized during experiments performed at the National Institute for Medical Research, in Mill Hill, London. The Medical Research Council's report describes the benefit likely to accrue from Feldberg's work as 'negligible' and admitted that 'applied to the methodology the word [...] "crude" [...] is not inappropriate'. They conclude that 'a number of animals perished for no discernible beneficial reason' and criticized the British Home Secretary for the fact that he 'failed to weigh adequately the likely benefit of the research against the likely adverse effects on the animals involved'. In some ways Feldberg was probably unlucky. I very much doubt if he was the only scientist in Britain who was failing to anaesthetize laboratory animals properly. He certainly wasn't the only scientist doing research work <b>of</b> <b>negligible</b> <b>value.</b> It's quite clear from this case history that it is a lie to say that animals which are experimented on are invariably and adequately anaesthetized.
