500|$|Kīlauea's {{ecological}} community is additionally {{threatened by the}} activity of the volcano itself; lava flows often <b>overrun</b> <b>sections</b> of the volcano's forests and burns them down, and volcanic ash distributed by explosive eruptions often smothers local plant life. Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of Kīlauea ash deposits are evidence of the many times the volcano has wrought destruction on its own ecosystem and that of its neighbor Mauna Loa, and parts of the volcano present a dichotomy between pristine montane forest and recently buried volcanic [...] "deserts" [...] yet to be recolonized.|$|R
25|$|On May 4, 2013, a train derailed when it <b>overran</b> a <b>section</b> {{of track}} on Line 4. The section was {{not open to}} the public and was {{undergoing}} testing. There were no injuries.|$|R
50|$|During Christmas 2012, a large {{landslip}} <b>overran</b> a <b>section</b> of the {{sea wall}} between Totland Bay and adjacent Colwell Bay, also blocking the walkway which ran {{along the top of}} the wall. The local council sealed off the affected section from the public. After a successful local campaign the council accepted a compromise solution and a new path over the landslip was opened to the public on 12th Sep 2015.|$|R
50|$|Asparagus - A general chorus cat. Not to be {{confused}} with Gus the Theatre Cat - in the video production, the two roles are portrayed separately due to the age of Sir John Mills rendering him unable to perform the dance/singing roles of Asparagus. Portrayed by Tony Timberlake. Tony Timberlake was due to perform Growltiger in the film, but Sir John Mills's filming <b>overran</b> and the <b>section</b> had to be cut.|$|R
5|$|The Cabildo {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation, {{and ordered}} the military to control the crowd and enforce {{the resolution of the}} previous day. The commanders pointed out that if they did so, their soldiers would mutiny. As the demonstration <b>overran</b> some <b>sections</b> of the cabildo, Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted. The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures, drafted among the people in the plaza. Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta. He rejected this at first, fearing that he may be suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest, but finally accepted at Cisneros' request. As the Junta was established on May 25, the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government; on May 27, they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta. Both invitations were contradictory, but the consequences would take place some months later.|$|R
50|$|However, the Cabildo {{attempted}} {{to thwart the}} result of the open cabildo, and appointed Cisneros as head of the new Junta. He made the oath of office, but the appointment was seen as a betrayal of the Cabildo, causing huge demonstrations. By the night of May 24, Cisneros resigned, along with the criollo members of the Junta, Saavedra and Castelli. But the following day the Cabildo did not accept Cisneros' resignation, and ordered the military bodies to suppress the demonstrations by force. The military commanders denied such support, and pointed that even if they accepted, their soldiers would mutiny against such orders. The demonstration broke into the Cabildo and <b>overran</b> some <b>sections</b> of it, so the members of the Cabildo finally agreed to accept Cisneros' resignation. The composition of the new Junta came from a document with hundreds of signatures; but who actually proposed the names remains unknown. The Primera Junta was thus the government that replaced Cisneros, ending the authority of the viceroys.|$|R

50|$|On 9 September 1916, near Pozières, France, {{the first}} three {{companies}} of Clarke's battalion went over the top, leaving the fourth in reserve. Clarke, an Acting Corporal at the time, was assigned to take a section to clear the enemy on the left flank to allow his company sergeant to build a fortified dugout that would secure the Canadian position once the salient was <b>overrun.</b> When his <b>section</b> reached the trench, it was so heavily defended {{that they had to}} battle their way through with hand grenades, bayonets and their rifles as clubs. Clarke was the only man left standing; the rest had either been killed or wounded.|$|R
5|$|That {{night the}} North Koreans {{launched}} a coordinated offensive against the entire UN force. The NK 6th Division advanced first, hitting F Company {{on the north}} side of the pass on the Chungam-ni-Haman road. The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass. The North Koreans captured a 75mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks, knocking out two of them. They then <b>overran</b> a <b>section</b> of 82mm mortars at the east end of the pass. South of the pass, at dawn, First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him, a mix of US and ROK troops. The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn. They came through an abandoned opening in the barbed wire perimeter. Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire, the North Koreans quickly overran the position. Numerous officers and non-commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line, but they would not follow these orders. In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping.|$|R
50|$|Cleomenes {{became aware}} of the fact that Antigonus had {{dismissed}} all of his Macedonian troops and decided to launch a raid on the Achaean League. He gave the impression that he was going to raid the territory of Argos but instead switched directions and attacked Megalopolis. The Spartans managed to <b>overrun</b> a weak <b>section</b> of the fortifications and began to take over the city. The citizens of Megalopolis were not aware that the Spartans were in the city until dawn after which a rearguard action by some of the citizens allowed most of the Megalopolitans to escape. Cleomenes sent the Megalopolitans a message offering back their city if they joined his alliance but when this offer was refused, Cleomenes ordered that the city be sacked and razed.|$|R

50|$|Citation:Sfc. Anderson (then S/Sgt.), {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action {{while serving as}} chief of section in Battery A, against a hostile force. During {{the early morning hours}} Battery A's defensive position was attacked by a determined North Vietnamese Army infantry unit supported by heavy mortar, recoilless rifle, rocket propelled grenade and automatic weapon fire. The initial enemy onslaught breached the battery defensive perimeter. Sfc. Anderson, with complete disregard for his personal safety, mounted the exposed parapet of his howitzer position and became the mainstay of the defense of the battery position. Sfc. Anderson directed devastating direct howitzer fire on the assaulting enemy while providing rifle and grenade defensive fire against enemy soldiers attempting to <b>overrun</b> his gun <b>section</b> position. While protecting his crew and directing their fire against the enemy from his exposed position, 2 enemy grenades exploded at his feet knocking him down and severely wounding him in the legs. Despite the excruciating pain and though not able to stand, Sfc. Anderson valorously propped himself on the parapet and continued to direct howitzer fire upon the closing enemy and to encourage his men to fight on. Seeing an enemy grenade land within the gun pit near a wounded member of his gun crew, Sfc. Anderson heedless of his own safety, seized the grenade and attempted to throw it over the parapet to save his men. As the grenade was thrown from the position it exploded and Sfc. Anderson was again grievously wounded. Although only partially conscious and severely wounded, Sfc. Anderson refused medical evacuation and continued to encourage his men in the defense of the position. Sfc. Anderson by his inspirational leadership, professionalism, devotion to duty and complete disregard for his welfare was able to maintain the defense of his section position and to defeat a determined attack. Sfc. Anderson's gallantry and extraordinary heroism at the risk of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R
