40|$|The {{advantages}} of employing passive optical architectures in the access network {{have been largely}} recognized. Particularly, recent developments in optical technologies have made the realization of wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM PON's) feasible and cost-effective. These networks are more future-proof than conventional PON's, thanks to their intrinsic optical transparency and their extremely high transmission capacity. A very useful <b>optical</b> <b>routing</b> <b>device,</b> called Waveguide Grating Router, is the basic building-block of new PON architectures capable of connecting {{a large number of}} users or to improve the use of the optical bandwidth. In this paper, we analyze the connectivity of WDM PON's composed of multiple stages of WGR devices. A design tool is also presented which is able to easily evaluate the connectivity functions of complex WDM PON's. The feasibility of these architectures is discussed by considering the costs and the technological limitations on the optical components...|$|E

40|$|A novel device, {{formed by}} a widely spaced {{periodic}} array of defects in a photonic bandgap crystal, is studied {{with the goal}} of designing a waveguide with a prescribed narrow bandwidth. Tunneling of radiation between the defect sites allows wave propagation along the line of the defects. An analytical study based on the weakly coupled cavity model is performed, and the dispersion relation �(�) of the new waveguide is derived. The frequency shift and the band structure of the periodic defect waveguide are linked by an analytic relationship to the distance between the defect sites and therefore can be tuned by varying the latter.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the feasibility of tunable, monolithically integrated, nonlinear optical frequency conversion sources which work under the principles of an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The room-temperature continuous wave (CW) operation of these devices produces narrow line-width, near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, primarily used in chemical sensing applications. The devices detailed here, based on the GaAs–AlGaAs superlattice material system, benefit from post growth, ion implantation induced, quantum well intermixing, to achieve 1 st order phase matching. The experiments, which have been performed to optimize the second-order nonlinear processes in our GaAs–AlGaAs superlattice waveguides, have demonstrated improved conversion efficiencies when compared to the performance achieved previously in similar superlattice nonlinear waveguides. We have achieved pulsed type-I phase matched second harmonic generation (SHG) with powers up to 3. 65 μW (average pulse power), CW type-I phase matched SHG up to 1. 6 μW for the first time, and pulsed type-II phase matched SHG up to 2 μW (average pulse power), again for the first time. Moreover, {{we have been able to}} achieve both CW type-I and CW type-II phase matched difference frequency generation, which converts C-band wavelengths into L- and U-band wavelengths, over at least a 20 nm conversion bandwidth. These results have been made possible through the systematic optimization of processes developed to fabricate nonlinear optical waveguides. Fabrication processes have also been developed to facilitate the incorporation of on-chip lasers and <b>optical</b> <b>routing</b> components, required to achieve a fully integrated OPO and nonlinear optical frequency converter. The <b>optical</b> <b>routing</b> in these <b>devices</b> has been demonstrated using a frequency selective multi-mode interference (MMI) coupler. The superlattice laser material has been designed by optimizing the material structure and employing different growth technologies. Room-temperature CW laser action has been achieved in 100 nm thick, superlattice core, half-ring lasers. The laser excitation is measured at 801 nm, and the internal power of the on-chip pump is estimated to be in excess of 200 mW in a full-ring, after accounting for <b>optical</b> <b>routing,</b> linear, bending and nonlinear losses. We have been able to conclude that our designed OPO and frequency converter is just feasible with the performance achieved in different components.

40|$|Trust {{plays an}} {{important}} role in our daily life, both implicitly and explicitly. Our decisions are based on our estimation of how trustworthy a person is or how reliable a service is. Consequently, there has been a rise in trust systems that model human trust in a virtual or computing environment. These trust systems or trust models help to bridge the gap of human feelings and intuition in an unfamiliar environment. Trust models collect information regarding the participants' activities and give a trust rating based on observed activities. In a network environment, a plethora of network devices are in constant communication as data packets are transported from source to destination. The autonomous nature of network environments and devices make it difficult to monitor the services and devices from a central point. Security mechanisms, such as IPSec, exist in routing protocols to safeguard network packets travelling in a network, however <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> that act as service providers are not protected by malicious attacks. For example, an attack aimed at the routing architecture of a network involves a <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> advertising itself as another <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> in order to divert network traffic away from its intended destination. This dissertation investigates trust models in network environments as a possible approach to predict and ultimately eliminate at- tacks on <b>routing</b> <b>devices.</b> To accomplish this, the role of <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> as service providers and requesters must be stated explicitly. Activities on a <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> must be collected and used to determine the trust level of the <b>routing</b> <b>device.</b> This dissertation presents the TSONE - Trust in Service-Oriented Net- work Environment - model. The model incorporates traditional service- oriented architecture (SOA) principles to define a service-oriented network environment. Services in this environment are then defined. Furthermore the characteristics of this environment are adapted from SOA principles. An approach is defined to collect and measure activities on <b>routing</b> <b>devices.</b> This is later used to determine the trust level of the <b>routing</b> <b>device.</b> Finally, a pro- to type illustrates that incorporation of trust models is a possible option in assessing availability and reliability of <b>routing</b> <b>devices.</b> Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Metallic {{nanoscale}} {{structures are}} capable of supporting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), propagating collective electron oscillations with tight spatial confinement at the metal surface. SPPs represent {{one of the most}} promising structures to beat the diffraction limit imposed by conventional dielectric optics. Ag nano wires have drawn increasing research attention due to 2 D sub- 100 nm mode confinement and lower losses as compared with fabricated metal structures. However, rational and versatile integration of Ag nanowires with other active and passive optical components, as well as Ag nanowire based <b>optical</b> <b>routing</b> networks, has yet to be achieved. Here, we demonstrate that SPPs can be excited simply by contacting a silver nanowire with a SnO 2 nanoribbon that serves both as an unpolarized light source and a dielectric waveguide.

40|$|Two-photon {{absorption}} (TPA) in semiconductors {{has been}} studied for several decades. Although many impressive experiments have been reported, it {{is still one of}} most actively researched topics. One major reason is that due to mature semiconductor manufacturing techniques, almost any desired material compositions and device structures can be grown and fabricated. Moreover, semiconductor-based laboratory experiments, if feasible, can be easily transitioned to the mass production stage, unlike those with atoms or molecules in a form of gas or liquid. TPA in semiconductors, therefore, has been researched not only to investigate the material properties that cannot be revealed with single-photon absorption or understand the physics of matter-light interactions but also to embody new practical applications such as <b>optical</b> switching or <b>routing</b> <b>devices.</b> In this thesis, two pioneering semiconductor-based experiments regarding TPA will be discussed. First, I will talk about coherent control of TPA in semiconductors. Here, the coherent objective is the ratio of the two-photon induced photocurrent from one diode to that from the other. This is the first semiconductor-based demonstration, {{to the best of my}} knowledge. This technique can be used for the demultiplexer-free detection of chirp-coded signals. Second, the technique of TPA-based femtosecond pulse characterization will be discussed. This technique features a very convenient experimental setup but an innovative approach that has never been used hitherto. Through those experiments ranging from the fundamental physics level to real-world applications, a new potential of TPA in semiconductors may be discovered. Additionally, I will cover several supplemental topics, including the TPA spectrum measurement via interferometric autocorrelation, implementation of the evolutionary algorithms, design of a multiple quantum well diode that may have tunable TPA spectrum, and so on. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Trust {{has become}} an {{important}} feature of security. Originally having {{its roots in the}} social sciences, it has fast moved into the field of computer science and more recently into the domain of network security.
