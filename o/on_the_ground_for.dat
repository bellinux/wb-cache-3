5|$|A strong {{anticyclonic}} multivortex satellite tornado also formed {{southeast of}} the primary tornado at approximately 6:28pmCDT (2328UTC), and remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> 15 minutes before lifting at 6:43 (2343UTC). Such companion tornadoes tend to be observed with especially large and intense tornadoes, although {{this was the first}} documented multiple-vortex anticyclonic tornado of this kind.|$|E

5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so rare {{that it has been}} {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> a few hours in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performances during the game, North Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf was named {{the most valuable player}} of the winning team, and Virginia Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen was named the most valuable player of the losing team. Keldorf finished the game having completed 12 of his 28 pass attempts for 290 yards. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Sorensen completed four of eight passes for 24 yards and carried the ball 10 times <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> a total of 19 yards. Al Clark, the quarterback whom Sorensen replaced, finished the game having completed nine of 17 pass attempts for 66 yards.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> people exiting their cars.|$|E

50|$|The Salvation Army Conference Centre & Children's Camp is also located here. The campgrounds {{were first}} {{purchased}} by The Salvation Army in 1917, but the Army ran summer camps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> {{nearly a decade}} before that.|$|R
5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} from Kyle in South Carolina {{peaked at}} 6.35inches (161mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings; there, {{a nursing home}} had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17mobile homes, forcing about 50people to move to shelters. Ten car accidents were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> about 1.25miles (2km). At its peak strength, the tornado overturned five mobile homes and a car. The tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged 106buildings, 28severely. Eight people were injured by the tornado.|$|E
5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries. Their ability {{to switch to}} berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E

5|$|The {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, {{one of each}} aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{before moving on to}} attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 observation aircraft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but {{it is not possible to}} identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from Hiryū were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{assignment}} at {{the beginning}} of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. Ryūjōs initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E

5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

25|$|Training {{missions}} {{were typically}} in two parts; first, a 40-hour flight—followed by some time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> refueling and maintenance—then a 24-hour second flight. With a sufficiently light load, the B-36 could fly at least 10,000mi (16,000km) nonstop, {{and the highest}} cruising speed of any version, the B-36J-III, was at 230mph (380km/h). Engaging the jet engines could raise the cruising speed to over 400mph (650km/h). Hence a 40-hour mission, with the jets used only for takeoff and climbing, flew about 9,200mi (15,000km).|$|E
25|$|Like other finches, the Gouldian finch is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on ripe or half-ripe grass seeds of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex grass seed (Triodia sp.) {{is an important}} component of their diet.
