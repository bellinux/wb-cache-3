40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a model <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> which will provide a generic and {{comprehensive}} philosophical and psychological theoretical foundation for the extension of current theoretical knowledge of ethical behaviour in organizations. In addition, the study's purpose is to provide information which might enhance the practitioner's ability to make ethically right, good, and authentic decisions. The primary data for the study are 14 theoretical models <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> developed in or having relevance ot administrative contexts. The study employs an interpretative-theoretical methodology of model construction which is both rigorous and deliberative. This methodology consists of four sequential phases: exploration, analysis, classification, and explanation. The five questions posed are as follows: (1) What is the purpose <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (2) What are the theoretical foundations <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (3) What are the elements <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (4) What are the moderators <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> (5) What is the process <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making?</b> The study concludes that there are two general purposes <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in administrative contexts, member utility and organizational utility. Member utility refers to the enhanced effectiveness of organizational members who are able to avoid ethical transgression; organizational utility refers to the general enhancement of the organization in terms of efficiency and effectiveness as mediated through the organizational culture and climate. The theoretical foundations for ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> are philosophical and psychological. Seven elements <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> are identified in the model. These elements are the recognition of the ethical issue, alternative generation, ethical evaluation of the alternatives, ethical judgement, intention, overt ethical/unethical behaviour, and ethical evaluation of behaviour. The moderators <b>of</b> ethical <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> are eclectic and have been grouped into five distinct categories of influencing variables. They are: individual, issue specific, significant other, situational, and external moderators. The moderators influence the decision maker and the ethical decision-making process. The model proposes that the process that ought to be employed by decision makers is open and rational. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority.

25|$|Will Mulcaster {{argued that}} while much {{research}} and creative thought {{has been devoted}} to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect {{it can be seen that}} the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{view is that}} agricultural {{food production}} supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies {{led to the development}} of different means <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and/or cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) child and a younger child concurrently, whereas this was not possible previously. The result is that a population can significantly more-rapidly increase its size than would otherwise be the case, resources permitting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{a growing}} number of dietary {{treatment}} options to choose from for the management of many chronic diseases. Shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> represents a promising approach to improve the quality <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> process needed for dietary choices that are informed by the best evidence and value-based. However, there are no studies reporting on theory-based approaches that foster the implementation <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in health professions allied to medicine. The objectives of this study are to explore the integration <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> within real nutritional consultations, and to design questionnaires to assess dieticians' intention to adopt two specific behaviors related to shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Methods Forty dieticians will audiotape one clinical encounter to explore the presence <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> within the consultation. They will also participate to one of five to six focus groups that aim to identify the salient beliefs underlying the determinants of their intention to present evidence-based dietary treatment options to their patients, and clarify the values related to dietary choices that are important to their patients. These salient beliefs will be used to elaborate the items of two questionnaires. The internal consistency of theoretical constructs and the temporal stability of their measurement will be checked using the test-retest method by asking 35 dieticians to complete the questionnaire twice within a two-week interval. Discussion The proposed research project will be the first study to: provide preliminary data about the adoption <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> by dieticians and theirs patients; elicit dieticians' salient beliefs regarding the intention to adopt shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> behaviors, report on the development of a specific questionnaire; explore dieticians' views on the implementation <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> making; and compare their views regarding the implementation <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in different clinical settings. It is anticipated that the results generated by the proposed research project will significantly contribute to the emergence <b>of</b> shared <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> in nutrition through a theory-based approach. </p...|$|R
