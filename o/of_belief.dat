50|$|While it is popularly {{conceived}} that religions {{each have}} identifiable and exclusive sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> or creeds, surveys <b>of</b> religious <b>belief</b> have often {{found that the}} official doctrine and descriptions <b>of</b> the <b>beliefs</b> offered by religious authorities do not always agree with the privately held <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> those who identify {{as members of a}} particular religion.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} coherence {{as a source of}} epistemic justification, particularly the argument that all beliefs must cohere within one’s ‘web of belief’, aka confirmational holism. Confirmational holism runs across a potentially devastating argument that a more coherent set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> resulting from the addition <b>of</b> a <b>belief</b> to a less coherent set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> is less likely to be true than the less coherent set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> I propose confirmational chorism (CC) to avoid this troubling outcome. CC posits that coherence adds epistemic justification by limited, logically consistent sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> exhibiting a satisficing degree of strength, inferential and explanatory connection. Limited coherence may resolve the above argument, but raises the need for another kind of justification: coordination (integration across sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs).</b> Belief coordination requires suppressing some beliefs and communicating other beliefs to ensure convergence on the right action for performance success. Thus, a belief in any particular context is justified not just because it is reliably formed and coherent, but also because of how it is coordinated between local and holistic goals...|$|R
40|$|The key {{concept of}} autoepistemic logic {{introduced}} by Moore is a stable expansion {{of a set}} of premises, i. e., a set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> adopted by an agent with perfect introspection capabilities {{on the basis of the}} premises. Moore's formalization of a stable expansion, however, is nonconstructive and produces sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> which are quite weakly grounded in the premises. A new more constructive definition of the sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the agent is proposed. It is based on classical logic and enumerations of formulae. Considering only a certain subclass of enumerations, L-hierarchic enumerations, an attractive class of expansions is captured to characterize the sets <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> a fully introspective agent. These L-hierarchic expansions are stable set minimal, very tightly grounded in the premises and independent of the syntactic representation of premises. Furthermore, Reiter's default logic is shown to be a special case of autoepistemic logic based on L-hierarchic expansions. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} models derive return continuation {{in a setting}} where investors have heterogeneous beliefs or receive heterogeneous information. This paper tests the link between heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and return continuation in the cross-section of U. S. stock returns. Heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> about a firm's fundamentals {{is measured by the}} dispersion in analyst forecasts of earnings. The results show that momentum profits are significantly larger for portfolios characterized by higher heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Predictive cross-sectional regressions show that heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> has a positive effect on return continuation after controlling for a stock's visibility, the speed of information diffusion, uncertainty about fundamentals, information precision, and volatility. The results in this paper are robust to the potential presence of short-sale constraints and are not explained by arbitrage risk...|$|R

5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points <b>of</b> <b>belief,</b> (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

40|$|Hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> play {{a central}} role in game theory. In practice, they are modeled by type structures. This allows the analyst to {{describe}} hierarchies without explicitly specifying an infinite sequence <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> The focus <b>of</b> this paper is type structures that contain all hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Can the analyst identify these structures without explicit reference to hierarchies? That is, does there exist a test, defined on the type structure alone, so that the structure passes this test only if it contains all hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>beliefs?</b> This paper investigates one such test. The test is based on the concept of completeness [Brandenburger, A., 2003. On the existence of a 'complete' possibility structure. In: Basili, M., Dimitri, N., Gilboa, I.
