40|$|Dietary CLA {{treatment}} reduced color a*- and b*-values <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> {{chicken breast}} rolls. Sensory panels rated the color <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> chicken rolls with CLA treatments {{darker than the}} control. The production <b>of</b> CO in <b>cooked</b> chicken rolls increased dramatically after irradiation and was correlated with the increased redness <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> chicken rolls after irradiation. Irradiation greatly increased volatile production and induced a metallic off-flavor in chicken rolls. The hardness of chicken rolls increased and juiciness decreased as the dietary level of CLA increased, and consumer preferred the color <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> chicken rolls after irradiation to the nonirradiated ones. Although dietary CLA was somewhat positive in reducing pinkness, but negatively influenced to the eating quality <b>of</b> irradiated <b>cooked</b> chicken rolls...|$|R

One QTL, qGCR 9 detected on chromosome 9 in 83 lines, was not reported in previous studies. At this locus, the O. rufipogon allele increased the glossiness <b>of</b> <b>cooked</b> rice.|$|R
50|$|On 9 November 1769, Cook {{landed on}} the shores of this bay to observe a Transit of Mercury. In 1919, an area of land around Shakespeare Cliff was set aside, and a small {{memorial}} was constructed, based on the erroneous notion that it was the location <b>of</b> <b>Cook's</b> observations. But the actual site <b>of</b> <b>Cook's</b> landing and observation was the eastern end <b>of</b> <b>Cook's</b> Beach, near the Purangi estuary. A smaller memorial plinth was established there also.|$|R
5|$|Netball {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the social life <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> Island women. For their social activities, rather than go to bars, they play netball and go to church. Netball games are most often played on Saturdays during the winter months from April to August, though games can be played throughout the year. Female players who make the national team are treated like minor celebrities.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle is {{also the}} Democratic Committeeman for the 4th Ward, a {{position}} within the Cook County Democratic Party. Each of the 50 wards {{of the city and}} the 30 townships <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> County elect a Democratic Committeeman to the Cook County Central Committee. These committeemen form the official governing body of the Cook County Democratic Party which, among other purposes, endeavors to attract, endorse, and support qualified Democratic candidates for office.|$|E
5|$|Preckwinkle {{nominated}} Joseph Berrios {{for re-election}} as Chairman of the Democratic Party <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> County {{at a meeting}} of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee on March 3, 2010. At the time Berrios was the incumbent chairman as well as a commissioner with the Cook County Board of Review and the Democratic candidate for Cook County Assessor. Berrios was re-elected.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} Andrew Flintoff {{following}} an injury would reignite the ongoing debate about which two <b>of</b> <b>Cook,</b> Bell and Collingwood {{should be included}} in the team, with many speculating that Collingwood would be the man to miss out. With the sudden departure of Marcus Trescothick from the tour just over a week before the First Test, the debate was settled for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Still {{interested}} in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> County as a major. On April 3, 1857, {{he was appointed}} adjutant general of Illinois by Governor William Henry Bissell. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the Mountain Meadows massacre, a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the Mormons. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion {{to the rank of}} colonel. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.|$|E

5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E
5|$|Toni Preckwinkle (née Reed; March 17, 1947) is {{the current}} Cook County Board President and a former {{alderman}} in the Chicago City Council representing Chicago's 4th ward in Cook County, Illinois, United States. She was elected on November 2, 2010, as President of the Cook County Board, the Executive Branch <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> County government. Preckwinkle first sought office in 1983 and was defeated twice before securing election in 1991 and subsequently being re-elected as alderman four times.|$|E
5|$|When Bounty {{returned}} to Tahiti, on 22 September, the welcome {{was much less}} effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship that the story <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent, and did not stay long. Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed 15 ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his skills as an armourer.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and {{his wife}} Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' {{decision}} to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser. As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water, and the Premier of South Australia, whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at the small town <b>of</b> <b>Cook,</b> {{where there was no}} supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser, but it was prohibitively expensive to run, and it was cheaper to simply transport water. However, the Australian government turned down Klaphake's proposal, and he lost interest in the project.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{deposits}} and midden remains {{suggest that the}} huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the North Island, extending from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the karst of the Waitomo Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke's Bay; {{it seems to have}} preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. Its range appears to have contracted following Māori settlement in the middle 12th century. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s, the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island, south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, across the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single waiata (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south <b>of</b> <b>Cook</b> Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.|$|E
