5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. <b>Other</b> <b>crops,</b> nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> are grown alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E

30|$|Microalgae can use {{sunlight}} {{more efficiently}} than <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> plants to produce oil [168]. The oil production capacity is almost one or two times higher than any <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> [169]. The open pond system is better for large-scale production. The main disadvantage of open pond systems is that by being open to the atmosphere, they lose water by evaporation at a rate similar to land crops and are also susceptible to contamination [122, 170]. Some protozoa may contaminate the system and hamper the growth of microalgae.|$|R
5|$|At {{its first}} landfall, {{the bulk of}} Hurricane Dean's damage was to agriculture. 12,000producers {{suffered}} losses, mostly in the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán. 30,000ha (74,000acre) of habanero peppers were destroyed, along with 150,000ha (370,000acre) of corn and 60,000ha (150,000acre) of citrus. Extensive damage to fields planted with bananas, avocados, cucumbers, squash, jalapeño peppers, and <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> were also reported on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with copra {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous raffia palm handicraft industry. <b>Other</b> <b>crops</b> grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b> The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat and <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow {{to be considered}} a nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.|$|E

25|$|Mr Garton first {{showed that}} the common grain <b>crops</b> and many <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> plants are self-fertilising. Up till that time they were {{generally}} believed to be fertilised by wind or insects.|$|R
50|$|A funguslike {{unicellular}} organism named Phytophthora infestans, {{responsible for}} potato blight and <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> diseases, has caused famines throughout history. Other fungi and bacteria cause {{the decay of}} roots and leaves.|$|R
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many <b>other</b> <b>crops,</b> probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, {{the damage was}} less than expected, given {{the strength of the}} cyclone. Most of the damage occurred due to the poor infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b> A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. <b>Other</b> <b>crops</b> grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E

5000|$|Peronospora manshurica is a plant pathogen. It is a {{widespread}} disease on the leaves of soybeans and <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> plants. The fungi is {{commonly referred to as}} downy mildew, [...] "leafspot", or [...] "leaf-spot".|$|R
5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi Island, where it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with <b>other</b> <b>crops.</b> The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
50|$|Jatropha curcas is lauded {{as being}} sustainable, {{and that its}} {{production}} would not compete with food production, but the jatropha plant needs water like every <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> to grow. This could create competition for water between the jatropha and <b>other</b> edible food <b>crops.</b> In fact, jatropha requires five times more water per unit of energy than sugarcane and corn.|$|R
40|$|Four locally {{available}} {{crop residues}} viz., jowar stover (JS), maize stover (MS), red gram straw (RGS) and black gram straw (BGS) were evaluated for carbohydrate and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein (CNCP) system. Lignin (% NDF) was higher in legume straws {{as compared to}} cereal stovers while Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) (% DM) followed the reverse trend. The carbohydrate fractions A and B 1 were higher in BGS while B 2 was higher in MS as compared to <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> residues. The unavailable cell wall fraction (C) was higher in legume straws when compared to cereal stovers. Among protein fractions, B 1 was higher in legume straws when compared to cereal stovers while B 2 was higher in cereal stovers as compared to legume straws. Fraction B 3 largely, bypass protein was highest in MS as compared to <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> residues. Acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADICP) (% CP) or unavailable protein fraction C was lowest in MS and highest in BGS. It is concluded that MS is superior in nutritional value for feeding ruminants as compared to <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> residues...|$|R

5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and <b>other</b> <b>crops,</b> leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and <b>other</b> <b>crops,</b> raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and <b>other</b> <b>crops</b> may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} agrochemicals {{are used in}} the {{production}} of non-organic, conventional cotton. Cotton production uses more chemicals per unit area than any <b>other</b> <b>crop</b> and accounts in total for 10-16% of the world's pesticides (including herbicides, insecticides, and defoliants).|$|R
