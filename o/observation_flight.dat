25|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{of tropical}} storms first began in September 1935. In that year the United States Weather Bureau decentralized its hurricane warning system, which depended {{to a great}} extent on reports from ships at sea, opening three warning centers in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Jacksonville, Florida; and New Orleans, Louisiana. In August the Jacksonville center followed the progress of a developing hurricane east of the Bahamas, determining that it would pass through the Straits of Florida and strike the north coast of Cuba. It contacted the Cuban weather service when ship information was no longer available, but track of the storm was lost when the Cubans observed no evidence of it. Acting on a report from a Pan American Airlines pilot, a weather <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> was requested of the Cuban Army Ar Corps and on 2 September 1935 its chief training pilot, American expatriate Capt. Leonard J. Povey, volunteered to locate the system. Although he was unable to penetrate the storm in his open-cockpit Curtiss Hawk II biplane, Povey provided information that indicated the hurricane was moving north into the Florida Keys. The destructiveness of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane prompted Povey to recommend a regular aerial hurricane patrol.|$|E

50|$|While Schleich was {{recovering}} from his wounds of August 1914 he decided to volunteer for the Royal Bavarian Air Service and was accepted for training as an observer. After service with FEA 1 on two-seaters, he applied for pilot training and qualified in September 1915. In October 1915 he joined FA 2b, and in January 1916, during an <b>observation</b> <b>flight,</b> Schleich {{was wounded in the}} arm by an exploding anti-aircraft shell. Instead of returning to base, while still in the air he had his crewman bandage his wound and then completed his assignment. He was decorated with the Iron Cross First Class for this action. The wound meant he did not see further active service until September, when he assumed command of Fliegerschule 1. He joined Jasta 21 in May 1917 and commanded the unit from June onwards. Prior to his leadership, Jasta 21 had a lacklustre combat record and low morale, but under Schleich within a month the Jasta had downed 36 enemy aircraft, 19 of them credited to Schleich personally.|$|E

50|$|By the Decree 10094 of 19 September 1924, the Military Aeronautics (AM) is reorganized, {{becoming}} a full arm of {{service of the}} Army, with the same status as the cavalry, artillery, engineering and infantry arms. The military aeronautics arm included the Inspectorate General of the Military Aeronautics, the AM Technical Commission, the aviation and aerostatics troops, the aeronautics schools and courses, the AM establishments and the AM services. The inspector general of the AM would preferable be a general or a colonel with all the conditions to be promoted to general, graduate {{in one of the}} aeronautics course, that would assume the role of the aeronautics commandant general in the headquarters of the field army. The tactical aviation unit continued be the flight (esquadrilha), each including seven pilots and respective aircraft, headed by a captain. Several flights could be grouped to form groups of aviation flights, each headed by a senior officer. The troops of the arm were defined at that time as being a fighter flight, a bombardment flight, an <b>observation</b> <b>flight,</b> a training and depot aviation flight and an observation aerostatics company. The aeronautics schools and courses would be the Military Aeronautics School (including an aerostatics section) and the mechanics and specialists courses functioning at the PMA. The Military Aeronautics School would only be activated in 1928, by the transformation of the Military Aviation School and the disbandment of the Military Aerostatics School. The AM establishments were the PMA and the Aeronautical Material Storage. The AM included the meteorological, the communications and liaison and the photo-topographical services.|$|E
40|$|On June 13 th, 2010, the Hayabusa sample return capsule {{successfully}} re-entered Earth s atmosphere {{over the}} Woomera Prohibited Area in southern Australia in its quest to return fragments from the asteroid 1998 SF 36 Itokawa. The sample return capsule entered at a super-orbital velocity of 12. 04 km/sec (inertial), {{making it the}} second fastest human-made object to traverse the atmosphere. The NASA DC- 8 airborne observatory was utilized as an instrument platform to record the luminous portion of the sample return capsule re-entry (~ 60 sec) {{with a variety of}} on-board spectroscopic imaging instruments. The predicted sample return capsule s entry state information at ~ 200 km altitude was propagated through the atmosphere to generate aerothermodynamic and trajectory data used for initial <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> path design and planning. The DC- 8 flight path was designed by considering safety, optimal sample return capsule viewing geometry and aircraft capabilities in concert with key aerothermodynamic events along the predicted trajectory. Subsequent entry state vector updates provided by the Deep Space Network team at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory were analyzed after the planned trajectory correction maneuvers to further refine the DC- 8 <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> path. Primary and alternate <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> paths were generated during the mission planning phase which required coordination with Australian authorities for pre-mission approval. The final <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> path was chosen based upon trade-offs between optimal viewing requirements, ground based observer locations (to facilitate post-flight trajectory reconstruction), predicted weather in the Woomera Prohibited Area and constraints imposed by flight path filing deadlines. To facilitate sample return capsule tracking by the instrument operators, a series of two racetrack flight path patterns were performed prior to the observation leg so the instruments could be pointed towards the region in the star background where the sample return capsule was expected to become visible. An overview of the design methodologies and trade-offs used in the Hayabusa re-entry observation campaign are presented...|$|E

Multiple layers should be considered as normal for cirrus formations. It is noted that the cloud height is an important factor for satellite cloud retrievals and cloud climatology...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{real-time}} data-monitoring software suite that we {{developed for the}} High Energy Focusing Telescope (HEFT). HEFT {{was one of the}} first projects to develop focusing mirrors and detectors for hard X-ray astronomy. We deployed these new technologies on the scientific ballooning platform. During a balloon flight, this so-called ‘ground support equipment’ (GSE) allows us to monitor the physical condition of the payload, and to inspect preliminary science data in real time, through displays of tables of frequently updated quantities and their averages, time-series plots, histograms, spectra, and images. Unique from previous implementations of GSE s for other experiments, our system is a server-client network that utilises TCP/IP unicast and UDP multicast to enable multiple, concurrent and independent display clients. Most of the code is in Java, and thus platform-independent. We verified that the software suite works on Linux, Mac OS/X and Windows XP, deployed it in two flight campaigns for use during on-site calibration, pre-launch practice drills, and an <b>observation</b> <b>flight</b> of 24 hours. This system, and individual ideas of its implementation, can be adapted for use in future experiments requiring sophisticated real-time monitoring and data display...|$|E

An automated telemetry system {{is being used to}} expedite the AH- 64 qualification testing with minimum risk by providing on-line analysis of measured data. This paper discusses the special application software and hardware developed for this helicopter testing. The software and hardware is designed to provide timely engineering analysis of test measurements in order to minimize flight-safety risks, aircraft turnaround time, repeat testing, and developmental problem delays. The analyses include structural, dynamic, aerodynamic, weapons-systems, and aircraft-system considerations. Selected samples of real-time analytical displays generated on the system are included. The equipment and capabilities of the system which is being used in the testing will be discussed. The system has two analytical stations with display capabilities data of which can operate simultaneously on a single telemetered data stream or, alternatively, each station can operate simultaneously on separate data streams. Of interest in this paper are the spectrum of ground and flight operations required to enhance safety, to verify the attainment of test objectives, and to analyze the document test results. The acceptable time lag for analysis of measurement may vary considerably, depending on the purpose of the <b>observation.</b> <b>Flight</b> safety requires the fastest possible analysis, while several weeks may be acceptable for the documentation of results. For my purposes, then, I define real-time analysis as the attainment of engineering answers within a timeframe that will not impede the safe progression of the test.
