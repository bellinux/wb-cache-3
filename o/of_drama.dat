5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century. His thoughts on Shakespeare's plays as a whole (particularly the tragedies), his discussions of certain characters such as Shylock, Falstaff, Imogen, Caliban and Iago and his ideas about the nature <b>of</b> <b>drama</b> and poetry in general, such as expressed in the essay on Coriolanus, gained renewed appreciation and influenced other Shakespearean criticism.|$|E

5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion {{of the work of}} Sigmund Freud.

5|$|Cartier {{continued}} to direct television dramas during the 1960s, although after Barry {{stepped down as}} Head <b>of</b> <b>Drama</b> in 1961, he lost much of his creative independence. Barry's successor, Sydney Newman, abolished the BBC's traditional producer-director role and split the responsibilities into separate posts, leaving directors such as Cartier with less control over their productions. Cartier also found himself assigned to direct episodes of regular drama series, as such as Maigret and Z-Cars.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argued that}} the {{confusing}} format of The Million Second Quiz, along with its lack <b>of</b> <b>drama</b> and technical issues with the show's app during {{the first days of}} the series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air.

5|$|Hazlitt often focuses, as well, on {{specific}} traits {{by comparing the}} characters not to those of real life but to characters in Shakespeare's other plays, comparing, for example, Iago with Edmund in King Lear.
