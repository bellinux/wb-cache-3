2500|$|Zigu Ornea ( [...] ; born Zigu Orenstein or Ornstein and {{commonly}} known as Z. Ornea; August 28, 1930 – November 14, 2001) was a Romanian cultural historian, literary critic, biographer and book publisher. The author of several monographs focusing {{on the evolution of}} Romanian culture in general and Romanian literature in particular, he chronicled the debates and meeting points between conservatism, nationalism, and socialism. His main early works are primarily dedicated to the 19th and early 20th century cultural and political currents heralded by Junimea, by the left-wing ideologues of Poporanism and by the Sămănătorul circle, followed independently or in relation to one another. Written as expansions <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> Ornea's biographical essays on some of the period's leading theorists: Titu Maiorescu, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Constantin Stere.|$|E

50|$|Before 1994 {{very few}} things were {{known about the}} natural history of the great green macaws and their {{abundance}} was in a sharp decline. In order to improve our knowledge on the ecology and natural history of this bird, a large radio telemetry was conducted by a team of researchers between 1994 and 2006. The main objectives <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> to determine the home range of A. ambiguus, characterize the habitats that it frequents and learn more about its natural history in general (feeding habits, ecological associations, abundance, and reproduction and nesting habits). The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> published in 2007. It was found that, in Costa Rica and adjacent Panama, the habitats where great green macaws occur were dominated by the wood almond (Dipteryx panamensis (or D. oleifera)), oilbean trees (Pentaclethra macroloba) and raffia palms (Raphia spp.). This is not surprising considering that great green macaws depend on D. panamensis for both feeding and nesting.|$|E
