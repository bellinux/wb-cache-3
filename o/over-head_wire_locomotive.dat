40|$|A generic {{problem of}} high {{frequency}} wave propagation along a metallic strip in parallel above a PEC ground plane is considered. The wave is excited by an elemental electric dipole at an arbitrary location above the PEC plane. The full wave problem, for arbitrary widths of the strip, is solved {{by means of a}} mode matching approach and expansion of the strip surface current into Chebyshev polynomials. For narrow strips, an approximate method using only longitudinal currents is derived, and compared numerically with the full wave method. Utilizing the concept of equivalent radius, the approximate method for narrow strips is evaluated numerically against results for thin circular wires. It is concluded that the approximate method is suitable for handling multiple wires in layered structures, wherefore the method has potential usefulness for estimating long range propagation of {{high frequency wave}}s in wire structures like power lines and railway feeding systems, containing <b>over-head</b> <b>wires</b> and wires submerged into ground.

Some freight was put on Clipper ships which could do the trip in about 120 days. Some passengers and high priority freight were shipped over the newly (1855) completed Panama Railroad across the Isthmus of Panama. Using paddle steamers to and from Panama, this short cut {{could be done in}} as little as 40 days. Supplies were normally offloaded at the Sacramento, California docks where the railroad started.|$|R

50|$|Locomotives on the {{electrified}} part of {{the railroad}} used single-phase, 15-hertz electric current at 3,300 volts drawn from an overhead catenary. Three-phase, 60-hertz electric current at 35,000 volts was bought from the Mt. Whitney Power Company and converted at Exeter. A single bracket-type catenary using 7/16-inch steel messenger was suspended 22 feet above the rail on poles 120 ft apart, supporting 3/0 trolley <b>wire.</b> The <b>locomotives</b> used sliding shoe-type pantograph trolley exerting an upward force of ten pounds on the wire.|$|R

50|$|Operations were {{transferred}} to the New York City Transit Authority on June 15, 1953. Passenger service on McDonald Avenue ended on October 31, 1958, and thereafter the South Brooklyn Railway started using the surface trackage solely for freight. In 1960, two more diesel electric locomotives were bought. On December 27, 1961, the line was de-electrified, due to {{the high cost of}} refurbishing the overhead trolley <b>wire.</b> Electric <b>locomotives</b> #4, 5, 6, and 7, which had third rail conduction shoes, were given to the NYCTA for subway and elevated operation.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic system}} unit is an Elementary Electrical Section {{consisting}} of a segment {{of one or more}} parallel tracks, each with a contiguous contact (or catenary or trolley) <b>wire</b> for the <b>locomotive</b> pantograph and an electrically separate feed wire. Elementary electrical sections are separated by section breaks where the contact and feeder wires can be interrupted with motor-operated air switches to isolate a section {{in the event of a}} fault or to permit maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak's 60 Hz {{traction}} power {{system in the}} Northeast Corridor between New York and Boston also uses split-phase power distribution. Two separate wires are run along the track, the contact <b>wire</b> for the <b>locomotive</b> and an electrically separate feeder wire. Each wire is fed with 25 kV with respect to ground, with 50 kV between them. Autotransformers along the track balance the loads between the contact and feeder wires, reducing resistive losses.|$|R

50|$|Fortunately, one {{advantage}} the {{drive on the}} BL2 locomotives model, {{was the fact that}} the trucks and worm gears covers were exposed. This made it easy to handle the above described problems. On latter models, these parts were encased in a massive weight which had to be removed. Getting this weight out required several screws to be removed, some hidden under the fuel tank. The weight also guided the <b>wires</b> around the <b>locomotive.</b> This made dissembling the locomotive for maintenance difficult and frustrating.|$|R
50|$|As on {{the dual}} voltage Class 19E, the main {{electric}} circuit is automatically selected in either AC or DC mode, {{based on the}} voltage of the overhead contact <b>wire</b> feeding the <b>locomotive.</b> To facilitate automatic trouble-free transition on the run, the locomotive is equipped with onboard voltage detectors, while the overhead wire is equipped with two wooden isolators and a 3 m length of neutral wire to separate the AC and DC feed. The neutral section {{is connected to the}} rails which serve as the return conductor on electrified lines.|$|R
5000|$|The train {{ran down}} the {{gradient}} towards Penistone station when the locomotive, having no leading wheels to guide it, jumped the points where the goods line diverged from the main line on the approach to the Huddersfield Junction signal box. The locomotive crew stood by their posts and applied the brakes. The coaches followed the locomotive into the [...] "six-foot" [...] ripping up some 25 yards of track. The tender capsized and became entangled in signal <b>wires,</b> the <b>locomotive</b> dug into the ballast and the front coach was totally smashed. Coaches two and three toppled onto their sides and the following three which were pulled round in different directions were left standing broadside against the first pair. One person was killed and many injured. Those with minor injuries were treated at Penistone Station, those with more severe injuries {{were taken to the}} Wentworth Arms Hotel, opposite the bottom of the station approach road, where the billiard room was turned into an operating theatre.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCuCrZr alloys are {{attractive}} metallic materials for applications on trolley <b>wire</b> of electric <b>locomotive,</b> integrated circuit and fusion reactor. The solid solution CuCrZr alloys were thermo-mechanically treated by heating up to various temperatures from 100 °C to 300 °C for aging treatment. Different tension elongations were exerted on the samples {{to accelerate the}} introduction of high density dislocations. The {{results showed that the}} combination of aging treatment and the simultaneous tension deformation can increase the hardness of the sample while decrease their electric conductivity. The high temperature of 300 °C resulted less reduction of electri*c conductivity than the low treated temperature of 100 °C. The disperse precipitation of the secondary phase were observed from the XRD and optical observations. The tension deformation leaded to the preferred orientation in the sample. The combination of aging treatment and the simultaneous tension deformation could reduce the aging temperature of CuCrZr alloys...|$|R
60|$|Goliah {{spoke to}} the Mikado and the Elder Statesmen. It was only an {{ordinary}} cable message, despatched from San Francisco by {{the captain of the}} Energon, but it was of sufficient moment to cause the immediate withdrawal of Japan from the Philippines and of her surviving fleets from the sea. Japan the sceptical was converted. She had felt the weight of Goliah's arm. And meekly she obeyed when Goliah commanded her to dismantle her war vessels and to turn the metal into useful appliances for the arts of peace. In all the ports, navy-yards, machine-shops, and foundries of Japan tens of thousands of brown-skinned artisans converted the war-monsters into myriads of useful things, such as ploughshares (Goliah insisted on ploughshares), gasolene engines, bridge-trusses, telephone and telegraph <b>wires,</b> steel rails, <b>locomotives,</b> and rolling stock for railways. It was a world-penance for a world to see, and paltry indeed it made appear that earlier penance, barefooted in the snow, of an emperor to a pope for daring to squabble over temporal power.|$|R
5000|$|Generally two {{separate}} overhead wires are used, with the rail {{for the third}} phase, though occasionally three overhead wires are used. At junctions, crossovers and crossings the two lines must be kept apart, with a continuous supply to the locomotive, which must have two live conductors wherever it stops. Hence two collectors per overhead phase are used, but the possibility of bridging a dead section and causing a short circuit from the front collector of one phase to the back collector of the other phase must be avoided. The resistance of the rails used for the third phase or return is higher for AC than for DC because of the [...] "skin" [...] effect, but lower for the low frequency used than for industrial frequency. Losses are also increased, though {{not in the same}} proportion, as the impedance is largely reactive.The locomotive needs to pick up power from two (or three) overhead conductors. Early locomotives on the Italian State Railways used a wide bow collector which covered both <b>wires</b> but later <b>locomotives</b> used two pantographs side by side. In the United States, a pair of trolley poles were used. They worked well with a maximum speed of 15 mph. The dual conductor pantograph system is used on four mountain railways that continue to use three-phase power (Corcovado Rack Railway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Jungfraubahn and Gornergratbahn in Switzerland and the Petit train de la Rhune in France).|$|R
