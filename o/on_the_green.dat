5|$|Dartmouth is {{well known}} for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are {{centered}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green.</b> At Homecoming each fall, a bonfire is constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a snow sculpture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green.</b> In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green,</b> which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key chariot races.|$|E
5|$|Other traditions {{involving}} the Green include {{the placement of}} a Christmas tree at the center each December and an annual Native American Pow-Wow. Students gather <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> {{on the night of}} the winter's first snowfall for a school-wide snowball fight. The College's commencement ceremonies are traditionally held <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green,</b> regardless of weather conditions.|$|E

40|$|Prior to the 2004 federal {{election}} <b>the</b> Australian <b>Greens</b> were rising {{as the third}} force in the Australian political system. At the 2001 election they secured an increased share of the vote and returned a second Senator. Conversely the Australian Democrats, held to be the third force in Australian politics went backwards in 2001, losing a Senate seat. From 2001 to 2004 <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> polled strongly and were buoyed by increased support for their anti-Iraq war and pro-refugee positions. As a party {{they appeared to be}} moving beyond single-issue status. Equally the Democrats were suffering from internal disunity and their support collapsed. By the time of the 2004 election <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> were expected to win enough Senate seats to at least share {{the balance of power in}} the Senate. These high expectations were held by political commentators and <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> themselves, buoyed by strong polling. This dissertation examines <b>the</b> expectations placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b> While it was found that expectations were too high, <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> nevertheless had <b>the</b> capacity to perform better than they did in <b>the</b> Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Greens</b> 2 ̆ 7 underperformance at the 2004 {{federal election}} is generally consistent with 2 ̆ 7 constraints theory 2 ̆ 7. While institutional barriers to minor party representation in the Australian parliament provided <b>the</b> greatest constraint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> 2 ̆ 7 election performance, this dissertation also examines the impact of government and media attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> during <b>the</b> 2004 election campaign and the Australian Embassy bombing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> 2 ̆ 7 election results. ii...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} student demonstrations took place in 1814, when students gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> to celebrate Napoleon's defeat in Europe. At {{the height of the}} Vietnam War in the late 1960s, the Green regularly saw antiwar demonstrations, some attracting up to a thousand protesters. A 1969 protest over the presence of the campus Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program culminated in the occupation of Parkhurst Hall, the College's administration building. In 1986, students constructed shanties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> to encourage the College to divest from South African companies supporting Apartheid; staffers of the conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review took sledgehammers to the structures. More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 May Day rally in favor of immigrant rights.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, a highly {{unstable}} Osborn has partially regained his sanity {{with the help}} of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.|$|E

The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>the</b> German <b>Greens</b> 2 ̆ 7 recent {{policy on}} Israel and Palestine, {{from the beginning}} of the first red-green federal government to the present.

This is explained with reference to both the continuing relevance of German history to German foreign policy, and the constraints that participation in the federal coalition - and supplying Germany 2 ̆ 7 s Foreign Minister - place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b> <b>The</b> influence of history and power <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German <b>Greens</b> is further illustrated by a comparison of German Green attitudes to Israel with <b>the</b> US <b>Greens</b> 2 ̆ 7 much more critical position...|$|R
