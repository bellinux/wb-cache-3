40|$|We propose in this {{communication}} {{to study the}} scattering {{of a group of}} cylinders at P-band in bistatic configurations. The goal is to determine which radar configurations can be of interest for FOliage PENetration (FOPEN) studies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> and which radar configurations maximise the difference between the amplitude of the cross-polarized scattering coefficients, when we analyzed a forested area. To achieve this study, we analyse the scattering by a group of cylinders at P-band, whose locations and orientations are either random or deterministic. The receiver is located at a constant place and the receiver moves around a square scene of about 400 m by 400 m, so that the aspect angle varies between 0 and π/ 2 and the squint angle is in [0,π]. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{study of}} the {{different}} stages of the electroless deposition of copper on carbon nano fibers activated firstly by a chemical treatment of the carbon nano fiber and secondly by a two-step method has been performed from both a chemical and a morphological point of view. The combination of XPS measurements and scanning electron microscopy imaging has allowed optimizing the 2 different stage conditions. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand,</b> the different oxide concentration and treatment time of the carbon nano fibers and on a second hand the different conditions of the sensibilisation (Sn bath), activation (Pd bath) and coating (Cu bath) have ben studied. The control of the homogeneity and thickness of copper thin films on carbon nano fiber can be obtained and further more sintered {{in order to obtain}} fully dense materials...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{simply stated}} {{is to determine}} whether ROS (as its name implies) is in fact an operating system. To this end we developed a three-step approach. Step one is to research the functionality of ROS. This step is well underway and progress will continue. Step two is to install ROS <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computer to better understand it. Step three is to run ROS <b>on</b> <b>a</b> iRobot Create, a platform we know ROS is capable of running on. The completion of our objective relies mostly <b>on</b> step one. <b>A</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> knowledge of ROS is desirable, but with the plentiful amount of articles and publications, getting {{a good understanding of}} ROS’s functionality is possible and more efficient with a literature review of the subject. For our research, we wanted to look into the following details: 1. Is ROS stand-alone software or does it run on-top of (or in conjunction with) another operating system? 2. Does ROS offer system calls, hardware abstraction, and resource allocation? 3. Does ROS have a similar user interface and installation method to other operating systems...|$|R

40|$|Reflecting a rich global coffee culture {{this paper}} explores the {{experience}} of visitors to coffee attractions as reflected through travel narratives published in the coffee trade literature. It first positions coffee related tourism within culinary tourism and then examines the types of attractions related to coffee. Using a typology of coffee attractions derived from the literature on both attractions and coffee travel narratives from five specialized coffee periodicals are reviewed. In doing so the paper makes a dual contribution to both furthering the study of attractions related to coffee tourism and to using narrative study methods in tourism research. In particular {{it is suggested that}} the narrative methodology may be applied to the study of other sectors of culinary tourism. A limitation of this study however is the use of secondary sources mainly derived from the coffee specialist literature. Nonetheless the narratives reveal the rich coffee culture and coffee experiences that can be associated with coffee related travel. In addition this exploratory study using published coffee narratives indicates the potential for future research investigating <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> basis the coffee experiences of tourists...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTerminology is {{assigned}} to play a more and more {{important role in the}} Information Society. The need for a computational representation of terminology for IT applications raises new challenges for terminology. Ontology appears {{to be one of the}} most suitable solutions for such an issue. But an ontology is not a terminology as well as a terminology is not an ontology. Terminology, especially for technical domains, relies on two different semiotic systems: the linguistic one, which is directly linked to the " Language for Special Purposes " and the conceptual system that describes the domain knowledge. These two systems must be both separated and linked. The new paradigm of ontoterminology, i. e. a terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, emphasizes the difference between the linguistic and conceptual dimensions of terminology while unifying them. A double semantic triangle is introduced in order to link terms (signifiers) to concept names <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>hand</b> and meanings (signified) to concepts on the other hand. Such an approach allows two kinds of definition to be introduced. The definition of terms written in natural language is considered as a linguistic explanation while the definition of concepts written in a formal language is viewed as a formal specification that allows operationalization of terminology...|$|E
