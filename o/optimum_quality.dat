50|$|Jones' {{research}} {{focuses on}} the role of climate in the structure and characteristics of agricultural systems. As such he is interested in how climate influences whether a crop is suitable to a given region, how climate controls crop production and quality and ultimately drives economic sustainability. His main focus on climate's influence on agribusinesses is in viticulture and wine production where climate is arguably the most critical aspect in ripening fruit to optimum characteristics to produce a given wine style. Jones examines climate's role in growing wine grapes and wine production from a holistic perspective trying to understand 1) the weather and climate structure necessary for <b>optimum</b> <b>quality</b> and production characteristics, 2) the climate suitability to different wine grape cultivars, 3) the climate's variability in wine producing regions, and 4) the influence of climate change on the structure, suitability, and variability of climate.|$|E
50|$|At a minimum, tariffs imposed must {{cover the}} cost of {{providing}} the service to the consumer. The consumer may be the final user or an intermediary such as a service provider. If a telecommunications operator cannot recover its costs, it will make a loss and the company will go bankrupt. Tariffs must also be used to cover maintenance, additional research and other indirect costs associated with providing the service. However, telecommunications service providers must be careful not to over-price each service, as prices have a direct influence on demand for that service (see supply and demand). Such an operator must constantly balance the need to provide cheaper rates, especially if there is strong competition, with the cost of maintaining the service at an <b>optimum</b> <b>quality</b> that is acceptable to the customer. If an operator charges too much, it risks alienating its customers, resulting in a loss of traffic and therefore revenue; if they charge too little, they will have insufficient capital to maintain the network's quality of Service. Over time this will result in customer attrition.|$|E
