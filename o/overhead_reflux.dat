50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as <b>overhead</b> <b>reflux,</b> and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as reduced crude oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{operating}} parameters {{on the performance}} of a prefractionator in solvent fermentation were studied by process simulation. Effects of feed position, side stream position and flow rate, <b>overhead</b> <b>reflux</b> rate and cooling temperature on the total solvent content in the bottom residue were investigated. These parameters were further optimized by response surface analysis according to the principles of central composite design (CCD), with the minimization of total solvent content in the bottom residue as the objective. A mathematical model for the correlation of total solvent content and operating parameters was established in the optimization, and the optimized results were verified by both simulation and experiments. Results showed that the response surface approach is more advantageous than single-factor analysis in the optimization of complex distillation columns, and the simulated results agreed well with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} DOE-sponsored {{technology has}} been deployed. The technology recovers light ends from a catalytic reformer plant using waste heat powered ammonia absorption refrigeration. It is deployed at the 17, 000 bpd Bloomfield, New Mexico refinery of Western Refining Company. The technology recovers approximately 50, 000 barrels per year of liquefied petroleum gas that was formerly being flared. The elimination of the flare also reduces CO 2 emissions by 17, 000 tons per year, plus tons per year reductions in NOx, CO, and VOCs. The waste heat is supplied directly to the absorption unit from the Unifiner effluent. The added cooling of that stream relieves a bottleneck formerly present due to restricted availability of cooling water. The 350 oF Unifiner effluent is cooled to 260 oF. The catalytic reformer vent gas is directly chilled to minus 25 oF, and the FCC column <b>overhead</b> <b>reflux</b> is chilled by 25 oF glycol. Notwithstanding a substantial cost overrun and schedule slippage, this project can now be considered a success: it is both profitable and highly beneficial to the environment. The capabilities of directly-integrated waste-heat powered ammonia absorption refrigeration and their benefits to the refining industry have been demonstrated...|$|E
