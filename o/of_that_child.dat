2500|$|In {{places where}} induced {{abortion}} is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive language issue. Research {{suggests that some}} dislike the term spontaneous abortion for miscarriage, some are indifferent and some prefer it. These preferences may reflect cultural differences. In the 1960s, the use of [...] "miscarriage" [...] in Britain (instead of [...] "spontaneous abortion") occurred after changes in legislation. Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify miscarriages. According to French statutes, an infant born {{before the age of}} viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>child.</b> This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.|$|E

60|$|It is {{possible}} that the two tremendous blows which Zeppa had received during the mutiny may {{have had something to do}} with his madness; but there can be no doubt that the intense mutual affection which had subsisted between him and his only child, and the sudden and awful manner <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>child's</b> end, were <b>of</b> themselves sufficient to account for it.|$|R
