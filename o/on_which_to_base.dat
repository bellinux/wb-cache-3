5|$|Because medieval Scotland {{lacked the}} {{intrusive}} government and growing bureaucracy {{that can be}} found in contemporaneous England, there is very little evidence <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> reliable estimates of population before the early 18th century. On the basis that it had roughly a sixth of the farmable land of England, {{it has been suggested that}} the population would have been of a similar proportion, probably a little less than a million at its height before the Black Death reached the country in 1349. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the 15th century. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of fifty burghs that existed at the beginning of the period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 by the end of the era.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal.

Because states could and did ban agency fee agreements, there was no governmental action <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge agency fee payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified.

25|$|Since the 1848 sale the {{maintenance}} of the house and gardens was neglected. Though the school tried its best it was obvious by the 1980s that a major restoration was needed. On taking over ownership of the gardens the National Trust commissioned a survey <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> a restoration strategy. Individual trees, boundaries, buildings, lakes, paths and fences were mapped. The first principle was to keep all buildings and planted features that were in existence by the time the last plan of the garden in 1843 was created. Another was to restore the main views and axes of the garden. The process was greatly helped by the Stowe Papers, some 350,000 documents that are now {{in the collection of the}} Huntington Library, containing extensive and detailed information on the creation of both the house and gardens.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, {{the results of}} his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.|$|E

[...] "There's lots of analogue distortion types, there's all sorts of different pedals and valves and things that are really breaking up," [...] said Gordon. They also took inspiration from 1960s music, using analogue equipment such as tape machines and reel-to-reel machines.

In October 1948, UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of the prototype Mark 1 while on a visit to the University of Manchester. Lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. In his letter to the company, dated 26October 1948, Lockspeiser authorised the company to [...] "proceed on the lines we discussed, namely, to construct an electronic calculating machine to the instructions of Professor F.

40|$|Preeclampsia {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} {{maternal}} and fetal morbidity and mortality and has an unknown etiology. The limited progress made regarding new treatments to reduce the incidence and severity of preeclampsia has been attributed to the difficulties faced in the development of suitable animal models for the mechanistic research of this disease. In addition, animal models need hypotheses <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> be <b>based</b> and the slow development of testable hypotheses has also contributed to this poor progress. The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of preeclampsia and the development of viable reproducible animal models has contributed significantly to these advances. Although many of these models have features of preeclampsia, they are still poor overall models of the human disease and limited due to lack of reproducibility and because they do not include the complete spectrum of pathophysiological changes associated with preeclampsia. This review aims to provide a succinct and comprehensive assessment of current animal models of preeclampsia, their uses and limitations with particular attention paid to the best validated and most comprehensive models, in addition <b>to</b> those models <b>which</b> have been utilized to investigate potential therapeutic interventions for the treatment or prevention of preeclampsia...|$|R
500|$|Aside {{from his}} work on The Cod Fisheries, Innis wrote {{extensively}} in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada's immense economic problems in the Great Depression. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see {{the effects of the}} Depression for himself. The next year, in an essay entitled, The Canadian Economy and the Depression, Innis outlined the plight of [...] "a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance", yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a Prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat, yet afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada's growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal–provincial relations. [...] "We lack vital information <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> prospective policies to meet this situation", Innis warned, because of [...] "the weak position of the social sciences in Canada".|$|E
500|$|In 1861, it was {{announced}} that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw {{this as an opportunity to}} write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a [...] "dangerous modernist", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia.|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> a hypothesis {{about the origin of}} the scleractinians; plenty is known about modern species but very little about fossil specimens, which first appeared in the record in the Middle Triassic (...) [...] [...] It was not until 25 million years later that they became important reef builders, their success perhaps a result of teaming up with symbotic algae. Nine of the sub-orders were in existence {{by the end of the}} Triassic and three more had appeared by the Jurassic (200 million years ago), with a further suborder appearing in the Middle Cretaceous (100 million years ago). [...] Some may have developed from a common ancestor, either an anemone-like coral without a skeleton, or a rugose coral. A rugose coral seems an unlikely common ancestor because these corals had calcite rather than aragonite skeletons, and the septa were arranged serially rather than cyclically. However, it may be that similarities of scleractinians to rugosans are due to a common non-skeletalized ancestor in the early Paleozoic. Alternatively, scleractinians may have developed from a Corallimorpharia-like ancestor. It seems that skeletogenesis may have been associated with the development of symbiosis and reef formation, and may have occurred on more than one occasion. DNA sequencing appears to indicate that scleractinian corals are a monophyletic group.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} first examine several related models in which {{superior}} care not ’usual and customary’–and therefore not currently covered by insurers–is compared to usual and customary care.
