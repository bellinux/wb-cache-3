25|$|After EchoStar {{obtained}} the broadcasting assets {{of a failed}} joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom, it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W <b>orbital</b> <b>location.</b> Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W <b>orbital</b> <b>location</b> it developed the Dish 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one Dish and an innovative dual-LNB assembly. Although the new 20-inch Dish 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch Dish 300 and DirecTV Dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The Dish 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to Dish 500, Dish Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels {{that can only be}} received with the Dish 500 and newer systems.

Originally, Dish Network high-definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes. Currently, Dish Network subscribers can receive nationwide HDTV channels using the 129°W <b>orbital</b> <b>location</b> or 61.5°W <b>orbital</b> <b>location.</b> Because of issues with low signal strength, the older model Dish 1000 has been replaced with the Dish 1000.2.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dermoid cysts are {{frequent}} unilateral congenital benign tumors {{that can be}} found at different locations throughout the body. In the orbital region, dermoid cysts occur predominantly in the supero-temporal quadrant. However, different <b>orbital</b> <b>locations</b> are possible, making this entity an important differential diagnosis for orbital tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 23 consecutive patients operated in our institution between 2005 and 2014 for orbital tumors that were diagnosed as congenital dermoid or epidermoid cysts. RESULTS: There were 21 dermoid and 2 epidermoid cysts. The median age at surgery time was 7 years (range 1 - 41). There were 15 females and 8 males. Eleven cysts were located supero-temporally (47. 8 %), seven supero-medially (30. 4 %), two temporally (8. 7 %), one at the frontal bone (4. 4 %) and two in the fossa of the lacrimal gland (8. 7 %). The mean cyst diameter was 13. 1 [*]mm± 5. 0 (SD). None had signs of malignant disease. No recurrence was observed after complete excision. CONCLUSION: Dermoid cysts of orbital region are mostly located in the supero-temporal quadrant. However, other <b>orbital</b> <b>locations</b> are possible and dermoid cysts must thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of any mass in the orbital region...|$|R
