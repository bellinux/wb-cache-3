5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The Lawyer to his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements <b>of</b> <b>Architecture</b> and An Abridgement <b>of</b> <b>Architecture,</b> two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E

5|$|Influences of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} can {{be discerned}} in the geographically distant schools <b>of</b> <b>architecture</b> of the Hoysala Empire in southern Karnataka, and the Kakatiya dynasty in present-day Andhra Pradesh.

This influence occurred because the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval Chalukya art.
