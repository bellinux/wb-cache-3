5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how {{clinical}} supervision impacts on staff development within acute paediatric care settings. The author analysed existing work, definitions and understanding <b>of</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> and explored the experiences <b>of</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> on staff working in paediatric wards and the effect <b>of</b> the clinical <b>supervision</b> on staff development. The first part of this study was quantitative and involved participants who were registered child health nurses and nonregistered nursing staff (n= 24). The second part was a qualitative study, involving registered child health nurses (n= 4) and nonregistered staff (n= 2). The research was carried out at two acute paediatric wards at two hospitals comprising one NHS Trust. The research incorporated a mixed-method approach.
