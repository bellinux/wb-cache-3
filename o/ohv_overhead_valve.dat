5000|$|The Hemi-6 is a pushrod <b>O.H.V.</b> (<b>overhead</b> <b>valve)</b> engine, with {{combustion}} chambers comprising about 35% {{of the top}} of the globe. This creates what is known as a low hemispherical shaped chamber. Although the Hemi-6 does not contain truly hemispherical {{combustion chambers}}, the [...] "Hemi" [...] moniker was used primarily for its marketing cachet based on the reputation of Chrysler's 1950s-1970s (true) Hemi V8 engines.|$|E
50|$|The Buick Model B was Buick's first model. It {{was built}} in Jackson, Michigan and was {{introduced}} in 1905 at the New York Auto Show. William C. Durant introduced the car himself at the exhibit, and took new car orders at the car show. It had a 2-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine - the world's first production <b>OHV</b> (<b>overhead</b> <b>valve)</b> engine - installed lengthwise within the frame, had a planetary transmission, with a cone clutch and two forward speeds and one reverse gear. The engine was rated at 21 bhp. In later years, it was renamed as improvements were made.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{his most}} {{important}} achievement was building {{one of the first}} <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engines (<b>OHV).</b> This he did in 1898 when he built a trike that weighed 118 pounds, and whose single cylinder had a bore and stroke of 3 inches each. He brought the concept of the <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engine with him to Buick in 1901, where the invention was patented to Buick's chief engineer Eugene Richard in 1904 (applied 1902).|$|R

50|$|Settled in Manhattan, the two {{brothers}} set up Ardun (derived from Arkus and Duntov) which supplied parts to the military and manufactured aluminum <b>overhead</b> <b>valve,</b> hemispherical combustion chamber heads for the Flathead Ford V8 engine. The purpose of the <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> design (already common with in-line 6 cylinder engines of that era), was to cure the persistent overheating of the valve-in-block flathead designs. The Ford flat-head V-8 'siamesed' the two center exhaust ports into a single tube, passing the hot gasses between those two cylinders (a massive heat transfer to coolant which was not present in <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> designs). The Ardun heads (designed with <b>overhead</b> <b>valves,</b> now presenting no over-heating problems) allowed dramatic increases in power output from the Ford V8—to over 300 horsepower. Ardun grew into a 300 employee engineering company with a name as revered as Offenhauser, but the company later {{went out of business}} after some questionable financial decisions by a partner that Zora and Yura had taken on. Arkus-Duntov attempted to qualify a Talbot-Lago for the Indianapolis 500 in 1946 and 1947. He failed to make the race both years.|$|R

25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models. These singles were {{available}} either as flathead engines or as <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engines until 1930, {{after which they}} were only available as flatheads. The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.|$|R
