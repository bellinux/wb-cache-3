By 1972 none had been located, and exploration ceased when the Khmer Republic (see Appendix B) fell in 1975. Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the South China Sea, however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's <b>offshore</b> <b>area,</b> especially because the country is on the same continental shelf as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 Port of Spain began growing southwards, {{with the}} {{reclamation}} of the foreshore mudflats, using fill from the Laventille Hills. This {{began with the}} area immediately east of the diverted St. Ann's River; the district is still called Sea Lots today. Gradually the landfill crept west and the area south of Plaza del Marina became solid land. Further major reclamation efforts {{took place in the}} 1840s, the 1870s, and in 1906. In 1935 the Deep Water Harbour Scheme dredged the <b>offshore</b> <b>area</b> along Port of Spain's western neighbourhoods, and the dredged material was used to fill in the area south of Woodbrook. Wrightson Road, linking downtown Port of Spain to its western suburbs, was constructed at the same time. These reclaimed lands were originally called Docksite, and were home to US forces during World War II; later a number of government buildings were constructed here.|$|E
500|$|The {{northern}} {{coastal region}} of California, which includes RNSP and the adjacent <b>offshore</b> <b>area,</b> {{is the most}} seismically active in the U.S. Frequent minor earthquakes {{in the park and}} offshore under the Pacific Ocean have resulted in shifting river channels, landslides, and erosion of seaside cliffs. The North American, Pacific, and Gorda Plates are tectonic plates that all meet at the Mendocino Triple Junction, only [...] southwest of the parks. During the 1990s, more than nine magnitude6.0 earthquakes occurred along this fault zone resulting in 1 death and major financial loss, and there is always potential for a major earthquake. The park ensures that visitors are aware of the potential for a major earthquake through the use of pamphlets and information posted throughout the parks. The threat of a tsunami is of particular concern, and visitors to the seacoast are told to seek higher ground immediately after any significant earthquake.|$|E

40|$|We {{completed}} a quantitative {{investigation of the}} macrobenthic community in the intertidal zone and <b>offshore</b> <b>areas</b> of Zhangzi Island in November 2011 to identify the distribution and potential anthropogenic impacts on this aquatic community. Four biodiversity indices, Bray-Curtis similarity, MDS ordination analyses, and ABC curves {{were used in the}} present work to analyze the community structure. We identified 39 total macrobenthic species in the intertidal zone of Maya Beach, of which the most dominant groups werethe Polychaeta, followed by Crustacea, and Mollusca. We found four dominant species belonging to Polychaeta, including Capitella capitata, Lycastopsis augenari, Naineris laevigata, and Lumbrineris latreilli. Average biomass of the intertidal zone was 25. 76 ± 41. 08 g/m 2, of which Mollusca contributed most. Average density was 315. 11 ± 160. 73 ind. /m 2, of which the Polychaeta contributed most. The average value of three biodiversity indices were relatively low (Richness index 1. 17 ± 0. 89, Evenness index 0. 74 ± 0. 17 and Shannon-Wiener index 1. 80 ± 1. 09). We identified 40 species in the <b>offshore</b> <b>areas,</b> of which the most dominant group was Polychaeta, followed by Crustacea, Mollusca and Echinodermata. We also identified five dominant species in <b>offshore</b> <b>areas,</b> including Ophiopholis mirabilis, Amphioplus japonicus, Lumbrineris latreilli, Echinocardium cordatum, and Ophiura sarsiivadicola. The average value of biomass and density was higher in the <b>offshore</b> <b>areas</b> compared to that of intertidal zone, with 218. 86 ± 152. 24 g/m 2 and 700. 00 ± 471. 51 ind. /m 2, respectively. The average value of Richness index was 1. 40 ± 0. 60, Evenness index 0. 64 ± 0. 19, and Shannon-Wiener index 2. 04 ± 0. 78. MDS ordination analysis showed that community structure was significantly different within the intertidal zone and the <b>offshore</b> <b>areas.</b> Lastly, the macrobenthos fauna in intertidal zone were impacted by a moderate anthropogenic disturbance, whereas the fauna in <b>offshore</b> <b>areas</b> wasslightly disturbed...|$|R
