40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of a particular cultural preference, "body modification" (i. e. the 'atypical' practices of tattoo, piercing, scarification, suspension and related practices), in the United Kingdom and United States. In the short span of about thirty years these practices have crept from the margins toward the mainstream and have lost a degree of their deviant status in the process. In spite of the geographic differences between body modifiers, meanings and motivations are remarkably similar across a number of themes. Yet the root of these similarities and growth in practice stems mainly from the actions of body modifiers themselves rather than swooping external, global market forces that would appropriate body modifiers' culture. Using Bourdieu's concept of the "field" as an <b>orienting</b> <b>tool</b> to explore culture, this thesis draws upon life history interviews with people who conduct body modifications, historical record, law and legal debates, questionnaire data, an abbreviated ethnography and letters between founding members of the field. It looks at how body modification emerges, grows, and maintains continuity of cultural content and changes through interactions between internal and external institutions, producers and consumers. The intertwined processes of legitimation, identification and professionalization {{play a crucial role}} in structurating the field to allow for growth and popularity. As a set of cultural practices that emerged from the margins of cultural preferences, the body modification field was shaped and continues to be shaped by the hostile environment from which it emerged, even though public reception to body modification is no longer quite as antagonistic as it once was. Emerging at a time when body modification was truly deviant from the norm, early body modifiers created strong frameworks of meaning and underlying values that were aimed at normalizing practices to a wider public, being inclusive to gain members and also embraced a wide variety of body modification practices. When the field began to grow and some body modifiers had formally organized, elite members forcefully attempted to draw practice away from the more 'extreme' end of body modification. This resulted in opposing efforts to reassert core field values, but as the numbers of both consumers and producers continued to grow the field was riddled with competition and boundary struggles. Gaining a modicum of legitimacy within the wider scope of cultural preferences and gaining new members caused tension over status hierarchies and the growth of more 'extreme' practices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{sequential}} transformative study was to elucidate the negative experiences of teachers with performance evaluations and to juxtapose the intended use of current popular teacher evaluation reform movements to the evident implementation. One may quickly assume that negative experiences with evaluation {{are a result of}} unsatisfactory teaching practices. However, this may not accurately explain the negative experiences. This study focused on the negative experience of teacher evaluation to provide a broader understanding of the impact of new evaluation policy reform on student achievement and teacher quality. Five data sources were analyzed: PAR policy, a teacher survey, district PAR data, individual interviews, and one group interview. Five teachers, bound by one school district, participated in the interviews. With a paucity of previous research focused on the negative impacts of teacher evaluation, this study addressed the following questions: (1) How does the PAR teacher evaluation process negatively impact teachers? (2) What, if any, parallel traits exist among those teachers who had negative experiences with the PAR evaluation system? (3) How does the intended use of the PAR teacher evaluation process compare to the evident use of PAR? Data were collected and analyzed using the Complementary Analysis Research Matrix Application (CARMA) as an <b>orienting</b> <b>tool</b> to juxtapose data collected in interviews, surveys, and public data sources. CARMA aligned with the overarching theoretical framework of critical multiculturalism by systematically collecting data and analyzing it in an organized approach that hoped to empower participants to share their experiences. The study aligned with critical multiculturalism by giving voice to a marginalized group and empowering underrepresented people. Data revealed dissonance among intent and evident use of the evaluation policy. A disproportionate number of African Americans, women over the age of 55, and teachers higher on the pay scale were referred to PAR. Additionally, data indicated that through the PAR evaluation system, teachers experienced negative health impacts such as, high levels of stress, depression, weight gain, despondence, insomnia, hostility toward family, deteriorating relationships, high blood pressure, and overall distraction. Furthermore, vague policy language was suggested as the impetus for misuse, abuse, and biased implementation at the local level. This study suggests that policy makers and school district officials take heed of multiple perspectives and consider the negative impacts of teacher evaluation reform. Evaluation systems that prioritize teacher learning over accountability are integral to successfully improving student achievement...|$|E
