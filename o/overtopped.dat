40|$|The {{development}} of wave energy devices {{is growing in}} recent years. One type of device is the <b>overtopping</b> wave energy converter (OWEC), for which {{the knowledge of the}} wave <b>overtopping</b> rates is a basic and crucial aspect in their design. In particular, the most interesting range to study is for OWECs with steep slopes to vertical walls, and with very small freeboards and zero freeboards where the <b>overtopping</b> rate is maximized, and which can be generalized as steep low-crested structures. Recently, wave <b>overtopping</b> prediction formulae have been published for this type of structures, although their accuracy has not been fully assessed, as the <b>overtopping</b> data available in this range is scarce. We performed a critical analysis of the <b>overtopping</b> prediction formulae for steep low-crested structures and the validation of the accuracy of these formulae, based on new <b>overtopping</b> data for steep low-crested structures obtained at Ghent University. This paper summarizes the existing knowledge about average wave <b>overtopping,</b> describes the physical model tests performed, analyses the results and compares them to existing prediction formulae. The new dataset extends the wave <b>overtopping</b> data towards vertical walls and zero freeboard structures. In general, the new dataset validated the more recent <b>overtopping</b> formulae focused on steep slopes with small freeboards, although the formulae are underpredicting the average <b>overtopping</b> rates for very small and zero relative crest freeboards...|$|R

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when <b>overtopped</b> {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E

Wave <b>overtopping</b> can be characterised by mean <b>overtopping</b> discharges but this does not provide information on individual wave <b>overtopping</b> events. This study was focused on parameters related to individual wave <b>overtopping</b> events with a low probability of exceedance. Measurements of velocities and the thickness of water-layers have been performed at the crest and inner slope of dikes. The height, width and roughness of the crest have been varied and also the angle and roughness of the inner slope. Based on these tests prediction formulae have been derived for velocities, the thickness of water-layers, and low-exceedance wave <b>overtopping</b> discharges. The estimates of these parameters can be used to characterise the wave loading on the crest and inner slope of dikes, especially as the characteristic wave loading for the initial phase of breaching of dikes initiated by erosion at the crest or inner slope. Besides above mentioned parameters also other measurements have been performed. This includes pressures at the seaward slope, mean wave <b>overtopping</b> discharges, percentages of <b>overtopping</b> waves, and volumes of water within individual <b>overtopping</b> waves...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} physical {{insight into}} wave overwash processes at low-crested beach barriers, wave <b>overtopping</b> discharge events {{rather than the}} conventional average <b>overtopping</b> discharge need to be quantified. Also, {{in order to make}} intelligent use of the many empirical formulations on wave <b>overtopping</b> discharge at breakwaters from literature, a single-valued appropriate slope for a natural beach needs to be derived. To resolve these issues, laboratory experiments of composite-slope low-crested barriers were carried out. The tests deal with overwash on a smooth non-uniform slope on shallow foreshores. The conventional average <b>overtopping</b> discharge concept does not represent the discontinuous character and associated strength of <b>overtopping</b> ow. Instead, e. g. for purposes of morphological modeling, wave <b>overtopping</b> should be treated as an event-based process. In this study, several new parameters such as the wave-averaged <b>overtopping</b> time, the relative total <b>overtopping</b> time, the <b>overtopping</b> asymmetry, the average maximum discharge and the average instantaneous discharge are defined and formulated. A new approach for defining an equivalent slope is proposed in the parameterization of the <b>overtopping</b> discharge that also takes into account effects of the wave period. It is experimentally shown to be an improvement over the conventional approach by Van der Meer (1998), especially eligible for low-crested sandy slopes such as barriers, dikes, dunes, etc on shallow foreshores.

40|$|Many sea defense {{structures}} need to {{be adapted}} to the rising sea water level and changing wave climate due to global warming. The accordingly required investments open perspectives for wave energy converters (WECs) – that are built {{as part of the}} sea defense structures – to become economically viable. In this paper the average <b>overtopping</b> discharges q of <b>overtopping</b> wave energy converters built in sea defense structures are studied. Physical model tests with this type of devices have been carried out in a wave flume leading to experimentally determined values for the average <b>overtopping</b> discharge q. These experimental data are compared with predicted average <b>overtopping</b> discharges using existing empirical formulae from literature – derived mainly for sea defense structures. <b>Overtopping</b> WECs have small relative crest freeboard heights and smooth slopes to maximize <b>overtopping,</b> which is contradictive to the basic role of sea defense structures. As a consequence, the experimentally achieved average <b>overtopping</b> discharges are situated in a range that is not well covered by the existing traditional prediction formulae.

It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971USD, $ USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29inches (261mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84inches (199mm) and Trenton with 7.55inches (192mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5feet (1.5m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8feet (3m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall <b>overtopped</b> the levee system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening {{in the fall of}} 1971.

The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the optimal dam inspection interval under the consideration of <b>overtopping</b> risk incorporating uncertainty gate availability. In earlier studies, assessment of <b>overtopping</b> risk only considered the uncertainties in reservoir properties and natural randomness of hydrologic events without giving much thought to the availability of spillway gates.

In this study, an innovative concept is proposed to evaluate dam <b>overtopping</b> by taking into account spillway gate availability. The framework consists of three parts: (1) evaluation of conditional <b>overtopping</b> risk for different numbers of malfunctioning spillway gates; (2) evaluation of spillway gate availability; and (3) dam inspection scheduling. Furthermore, considerations are given to <b>overtopping</b> risk, inspection cost, and dam break cost for determining the optimal inspection schedule.
