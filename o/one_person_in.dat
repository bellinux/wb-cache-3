5|$|Bertha {{was one of}} {{only three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall on both Louisiana and Texas; the others being Allison in 2001 and Fern in 1971. Heavy surf killed <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Florida. The storm dropped moderate amounts of rainfall along its path, peaking at over 10inches (250mm) in eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Damage was light, totaling to only $200,000 (2002USD, $240,000 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|High winds {{across the}} state {{included}} a report of 47mph (76km/h) near the state's southeastern coastline. The winds downed some trees and resulted in power outages, and <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Carrolwood was injured after a tree fell onto a house. The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state, some of which damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2,000people without power after it knocked down a power line. Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{caused the}} deaths of at least 51 people along its path, and {{produced}} over $1.8 billion (2010 USD) in damage. The precursor of the hurricane produced substantial rainfall across the Greater Antilles, causing one death in the Dominican Republic. Fourteen {{people were killed in}} Central America as a result of flooding during the first landfall of Alex. In Mexico, the storm's outer rainbands killed three people in Acapulco, <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Oaxaca, and another in Chiapas. At its final landfall, Alex caused at least fifteen deaths in Nuevo León, eight in Coahuila, six in Guanajuato, and one in both Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosí; an additional twenty persons were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E

5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 USD ($ 2011 USD) in damage. The cyclone later killed <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's six {{tropical}} cyclones, five became tropical {{storms and}} four strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, {{none of these}} strengthened into a major hurricane—Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—marking the seventh such occurrence since 1900. The strongest hurricane of the season peaked as only as a strong Category2 with winds of 110mph (175 km/h). The second hurricane caused one death and $1.45million (1920USD) in damage in Louisiana, the third left one fatality in North Carolina, and the fifth storm indirectly killed <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Florida.|$|E

Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{resident}} who migrated to Singapore was Yamamoto Otokichi in 1862 and who died here in 1867. His remains were later reburied at the Japanese Cemetery Park in Hougang. Uta Matsuda, {{the first female}} Japanese settler, ran a grocery shop with her Chinese husband in the 1860s. The Japanese introduced the Jinrickshaw to the local scene, a two-wheeled, passenger cart pulled by <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> 1894, which culminated {{in the building of}} the Jinricksha Station in early 1900s. They set up various Japanese shops and companies and the community increased substantially numbering 6,950 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change {{for there to be}} any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|In Kyushu, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529ha (55,670acres) and accounting for ¥64billion ($530million USD) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya {{was killed when}} the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. High winds and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars, killing <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Ōshima. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. On nearby Shikoku island, high winds and rains caused ¥4.7billion ($35.7million USD) in damage in Tokushima, mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses. A record storm surge, in conjunction with high winds, damaged a school in Sakaide, {{as well as a}} floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture. Rough surf swept away a women in Matsuyama.|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros.

Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
