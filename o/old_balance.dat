60|$|The next {{article of}} direct {{monopoly}} subservient to the Company's export is saltpetre. This, {{as well as}} opium, is far the greater part the produce of the province of Bahar. The difference between the management and destination of the two articles has been this. Until the year 1782, the opium has been sold in the country, and the produce of the sale laid out in country merchandise for the Company's export. A great part of the saltpetre is sent out in kind, and never {{has contributed to the}} interior circulation and commerce of Bengal. It is managed by agency on the Company's account. The price paid to the manufacturer is invariable. Some of the larger undertakers receive advances to enable them to prosecute their work; but as they are not always equally careful or fortunate, it happens that large balances accumulate against them. Orders have been sent from Calcutta {{from time to time to}} recover their balances, with little or no success, but with great vexation to all concerned in the manufacture. Sometimes they have imprisoned the failing contractors in their own houses,--a severity which answers no useful purpose. Such persons are so many hands detached from the improvement and added to the burden of the country. They are persons of skill drawn from the future supply of that monopoly in favor of which they are prosecuted. In case of the death of the debtor, this rigorous demand falls upon the ruined houses of widows and orphans, and may be easily converted into a means either of cruel oppression or a mercenary indulgence, according to the temper of the exactors. Instead of thus having recourse to imprisonment, the <b>old</b> <b>balance</b> is sometimes deducted from the current produce. This, in these circumstances, is a grievous discouragement. People must be discouraged from entering into a business, when, the commodity being fixed to one invariable standard and confined to one market, the best success can be attended only with a limited advantage, whilst a defective produce can never be compensated by an augmented price. Accordingly, very little of these advances has been recovered, and after much vexation the pursuit has generally been abandoned. It is plain that there can be no life and vigor in any business under a monopoly so constituted; nor can the true productive resources of the country, in so large an article of its commerce, ever come to be fully known.|$|E
6000|$|Another quite {{logical and}} {{consistent}} element, {{in the very}} logical and consistent creed we call Mahometanism, is the element that we call Vandalism. Since such few and obvious things alone are vital, and since a half-artistic half-antiquarian affection {{is not one of}} these things, and cannot be called obvious, it is largely left out. It is very difficult to say in a few well-chosen words exactly what is now the use of the Pyramids. Therefore Saladin, the great Saracen warrior, simply stripped the Pyramids to build a military fortress on the heights of Cairo. It is a little difficult to define exactly what is a man's duty to the Sphinx; and therefore the Mamelukes used it entirely as a target. There was little in them of that double feeling, full of pathos and irony, which divided the hearts of the primitive Christians in presence of the great pagan literature and art. This is not concerned with brutal outbreaks of revenge which may be found on both sides, or with chivalrous caprices of toleration, which may also be found on both sides; it is concerned with the inmost mentality of the two religions, which must be understood in order to do justice to either. The Moslem mind never tended to that mystical mode of [...] "loving yet leaving" [...] with which Augustine cried aloud upon the ancient beauty, or Dante said farewell to Virgil when he left him in the limbo of the pagans. The Moslem traditions, unlike the medieval legends, do not suggest the image of a knight who kissed Venus before he killed her. We see in all the Christian ages this combination which is not a compromise, but rather a complexity made by two contrary enthusiasms; as when the Dark Ages copied out the pagan poems while denying the pagan legends; or when the popes of the Renascence imitated the Greek temples while denying the Greek gods. This high inconsistency is inconsistent with Islam. Islam, as I have said, takes everything literally, and does not know how to play with anything. And the cause of the contrast is the historical cause of which we must be conscious in all studies of this kind. The Christian Church had from a very early date the idea of reconstructing a whole civilisation, and even a complex civilisation. It was the attempt to make a new balance, which differed from the <b>old</b> <b>balance</b> of the stoics of Rome; but which could not afford to lose its balance any more than they. It differed because the old system was one of many religions under one government, while the new was one of many governments under one religion. But the idea of variety in unity remained though it was in a sense reversed. A historical instinct made the men of the new Europe try hard to find a place for everything in the system, however much might be denied to the individual. Christians might lose everything, but Christendom, if possible, must not lose anything. The very nature of Islam, even at its best, was quite different from this. Nobody supposed, even subconsciously, that Mahomet meant to restore ancient Babylon as medievalism vaguely sought to restore ancient Rome. Nobody thought that the builders of the Mosque of Omar had looked at the Pyramids as the builders of St. Peter's might have looked at the Parthenon. Islam began at the beginning; it was content with the idea that it had a great truth; as indeed it had a colossal truth. It was so huge a truth that {{it was hard to see}} it was a half-truth.|$|E

Other problems included drunkenness among the men—and their officers—and uncertainty as to when and where the expected Northern invasion would begin.

Physical performance balance and functional mobility were measured pre-and 1 week post-operatively using the Tinetti Fall Risk Scale, Timed Up and Go, and 6 -Minute Walk test. Measures were repeated 6 weeks after surgery. Nonparametric tests for paired data were used comparing scores baseline to post-operative (POD) 7 and to POD 42. Results: Median age was 72 years (range 65 - 88). Fall risk was elevated during the first 2 post-operative weeks, greatest on the median discharge day, POD 2 (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Dams {{are among}} the obvious {{efforts to improve the}} {{economic}} situation in a developing country. They aim at using locally available natural resources. At present they {{are among the}} most popular means for promoting socio-economic development. A significant number of these programmes have been undertaken in Africa during the past two decades, and it is to be expected that many more will follow in due course. Dams are anything but natural. They do not fit into the <b>old</b> <b>balance</b> which nature established between climate and environment. Man responded to this ecological situation by creating systems of food production, by rigidly adhering to their routine, by constructing shelter fitting the needs of his household, and by developing customs and rules to guide his daily life. These conditions of human living, also called subsistence economy, still prevail in many parts of Africa, and we usuallY consider them as belonging to a traditional life-style. But technological progress tends increasingly to disrupt the old ways of life by promising a different and· brighter future. Obstructing the natural flow of rivers on a previously unprecedented scale, and subjugating them to the strivings of man is just one of them. For growing food where this was formerly scarce, and for multiplying power which formerly depended on man's muscles only, this procedure is very efficient. As, however, only the sun rises for nothing. such gigantic efforts have to be paid somehow in gigantic currency. A dam creates a crisis situation in a given ecological setting. It does more than throwing up another physical gradient. It creates a new environment not only for flora and fauna, but also for man. Especially the history of the great seas-connecting canals is full of calamities following such interventions. Of the more recent history of numerous larger and smaller dams it can be confidently stated that every one was followed by undesirable or unforeseen effects. In recent years the attention for those effects has rapidly grown, and is still expressing itself in relevant documentation. Water and development in Africa are items very different from those in temperate climates. They have much more to do with health and wellbeing of the people involved. Those people are far less prepared for the implications than in economically advanced societies. That means that much more attention and efforts should be spent on planning, monitoring and evaluating the health effects at the introduction of dams and irrigation. The author himself was confronted with the consequences of dam construction on two different occasions. First, at Yelwa (Northern Nigeria) when he was a local doctor near the newly created lake behind Kainji Dam. Second, as a lecturer in Community Health at the University of Nairobi (Kenya). At that time the Kamburu Dam was already well underway in construction.

Fourteen lines were from Barcelona, Spain, 25 were from California populations {{and the other}} two were from laboratory stocks. Two common electromorphs, SOD(S) and SOD(F), are segregating in the populations. Our sample of 41 lines included 19 Sod(S) and 22 Sod(F) alleles (henceforward referred to as Slow and Fast alleles). All 19 Slow alleles were identical in sequence. Of the 22 Fast alleles sequenced, nine were identical in sequence and are referred to as the Fast A haplotypes. The Slow allele sequence differed from the Fast A haplotype at a single nucleotide site, the site that accounts for the amino acid difference between SOD(S) and SOD(F). There were nine other haplotypes among the remaining 13 Fast alleles sequenced. The overall level of nucleotide diversity (π) in this sample is not greatly different than that found at other loci in D. melanogaster. It is concluded that the Slow/Fast polymorphism is a recently arisen polymorphism, not an <b>old</b> <b>balanced</b> polymorphism. The large group of nearly identical haplotypes suggests that a recent mutation, at the Sod locus or tightly linked to it, has increased rapidly in frequency to around 50 %, both in California and Spain. The application of a new statistical test demonstrates that the occurrence of such large numbers of haplotypes with so little variation among them is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral model. We suggest that the high frequency of some haplotypes is due to natural selection at the Sod locus or at a tightly linked locus...|$|R

Almost uniformly, reviews noted Lambert's vocals, his [...] "sizzle" [...] and [...] "electrifying" [...] presence; along with the synergy of the collaboration, which Brian May called [...] "organic".|$|R
50|$|The card {{could not}} be used to enter a gate when the balance ran below the minimum price of a ticket, yet cash {{could not be}} added to a card. To use up the {{remaining}} fare on those cards, tickets could be bought with cards and cash in combination, or a new card could be bought with the <b>old</b> card's <b>balance</b> rolled over onto the balance of the new card. For example, a card with 100 yen left may have been used to pay for a new card costing 5,000 yen, resulting in a card with 5,700 yen's worth of fare. When buying cards from the subway system, the maximum <b>balance</b> on an <b>old</b> card to do this procedure was 310 yen and for cards bought from Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu), it was a 690 yen balance when buying cards costing 2,000 yen or 3,000 yen, and a 1,500 yen balance when buying cards costing 5,000 yen.|$|R
