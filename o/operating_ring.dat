50|$|The cocking piece {{doubles as}} a safety and is {{attached}} {{at the rear of}} the bolt sleeve assembly and secures the firing pin. When the cocking piece ending in a cocking ring is pulled rearward and turned horizontal, the cocking piece sear can be placed in a recessed safety slot in the bolt plug. This slot is shorter than the firing slot so the firing pin cannot protrude past the face of the bolt cylinder. Any contact with the cartridge primer is thus prevented. The safe mode also prevents the action from being cycled hence preventing the bolt from accidental opening. The <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> is quite large, making it easy to operate with gloves. When the <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> is in the vertical position and pulled back by cycling the action or cocking it by hand the action is ready to fire.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|E

This order is a natural <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> for the idealI, and is an important invariant of its Zp[G]-structure. We show that unlessGis cyclic no such order can contain any idempotent of Qp[G] which does not already lie in Zp[G] This is a strong restriction on the possible structures of arithmetical associated orders. We also describe an algorithm for the explicit computation of associated orders which can in many cases be implemented effectively on a computer. In this way {{we are able to}} compute explicit examples of arithmetical associated orders which falsify a conjecture previously made by the second named author...|$|E

40|$|Imperfections in {{the surface}} of {{intracavity}} elements of an optical ring resonator can scatter light from one mode into the counterpropagating mode. The phase-locking of the cavity modes induced by this backscattering is a well-known example that notoriously afflicts laser gyroscopes and similar active systems. We experimentally show how backscattering can be circumvented in a unidirectionally <b>operated</b> <b>ring</b> cavity either by an appropriate choice of the resonant cavity mode or by active feedback control.

40|$|A ring laser {{gyroscope}} (gyro) {{is an active}} laser interferometer designed to sense rotation through the Sagnac frequency shift encountered by two beams travelling in opposite directions around a closed path. The classes of devices considered in this thesis are the large and ultra-large ring laser gyros. These instruments are designed for direct measurement of earth rotation rate and find applications in geodesy, geophysics, and tests of physical theories. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the demonstration of new techniques for <b>operating</b> <b>ring</b> laser gyros. The main goal of these techniques has been the correction for variations in the geometry of an ultra-large ring laser gyro, UG- 3. This instrument is a 77 m perimeter ultra-large ring laser gyro of heterolithic construction and is the primary instrument used in the experiments presented here. UG- 3 {{has been used to}} demonstrate measurement of earth strains which have been used to correct for changes in the geometry of the instrument. It has also been used to demonstrate a control technique where the co-rotating beams were alternately offset allowing the number of wavelengths around the perimeter to be counted and a Sagnac rotation signal to be obtained. Among the most important outcomes of this research of interest to the large ring laser gyro community is that we now understand most of the problems that would affect a next generation ring laser gyro. This understanding allows us to choose an operational technique best suited to the measurements being made and thus maximise the scientific potential of the instrument. Additionally, {{the development of a new}} standard for data storage and an associated suite of software to acquire, query and analyse ring laser data is expected to improve collaboration with the wider research community. Other research outcomes of more general interest include the analysis of how oscillation of a single mode is established in a high finesse laser cavity. We demonstrate that the ultimate mode of operation can be selected with a ‘seed’ beam of exceptionally low intensity. An interesting related outcome is the demonstration of Sagnac beat frequency measurement during the ring down of a ring cavity, a type of measurement immune to dispersive and flow related frequency shifts...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} emphasis {{has been placed}} on the enhancement of dynamic stability of power systems. This involves the addition of external controller or compensators of the existing power plant. This thesis describes the application of different techniques including optimal control theory in the improving the dynamic stability of the multi-machine system. The complex power system is considered as a dual-level form of system representation, rather than a signle machine-infinite bus system. The pertinent small signal equations are derived and the state space model is developed. Different techniques including optimal control theory and its modifications and conventional "eigenvalue search" methods have been applied in designing different types of controllers in order to give improved system performance in the dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>rang</b> of a power system. A practical application involving the design of a controller for the Squaw Rapids Generating Station of Saskatchewan Power Corporation is used as a means of comparing the different techniques...|$|R
