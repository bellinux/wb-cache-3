5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> social fluidity in the society.|$|E

25|$|Most {{sources of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation contain {{a large number}} of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polarization, and the parameters of the polarization ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Unpolarized {{light can}} be {{described}} as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity.

One may then describe the light in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polarization and the parameters of the polarized component.

However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.|$|E
