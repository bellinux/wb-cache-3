40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the efficacy of using the developmental stages of the canines and third molars to predict the timing of skeletal maturity in the Saudi population. Material and methods: The lateral cephalometric radiographs and <b>orthopantograms</b> of 239 Saudi patients, 106 males and 133 females, aged 9 to 21  years, were collected from several dental centers. <b>Orthopantograms</b> were used to assess the developmental stages of the upper and lower canine teeth and third molars using two popular methods: that of Nolla and that of Demirjian. Cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) stage was assessed on the lateral cephalometric images according to the method of Baccetti et al. Trained observers with no knowledge of patient age or gender performed assessments. Data were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient at a significance level of P ≤ . 05. Result: Skeletal CVM stages III and IV had a stronger correlation with mandibular left canine developmental stage than with maxillary canine developmental stage in the two methods used (correlation with Nolla stage 10 and Demirjian stage H: root completely formed with apex closed), especially for male patients (r =  0. 700, P < . 001). In contrast, the maxillary third molars at Nolla stages 5 and 7 (crown completed to 1 / 3 of the root formed) showed an association with CVM stages III and IV (r =  0. 540 for females and r =  0. 639 for males, P ≤ . 001 for both) and with Demirjian stages D, E, and F. Males had slightly higher correlation values than females (r =  0. 578 and 0. 5010, respectively; P ≤ . 001) at CVM stages III and IV. Interestingly, canine teeth showed a stronger correlation than third molars with skeletal maturation in Saudi children.

40|$|In the past, {{forensic}} odentology {{could not}} provide estimates of reaching the age of 18, based on bio-developmental major criteria such as wisdom teeth mineralization and eruption. Until this juncture, completion of root mineralization was considered especially {{to be the final}} stage of the wisdom teeth development. Simultaneously, it was recognized in practice that changes were occurring in roots of the third molar, {{in the sense of a}} progressive invisibility of roots channels and of the parodontal gap, also after the completion of root formation. The objective of the retrospective study presented here has been to investigate to what degree the observed phenomena can be classified, and, if so, whether in the confirmed by practice stage classifications singular stages can be attributed to age, and the important for the age estimate routine secure differentiation of attaining 18 years of can be attained or not, taking into account the observed phenomena. Investigated were 1198 conventionally prepared <b>orthopantograms</b> of 629 German females and 569 males in the age range from 15 to 40. These <b>orthopantograms</b> were taken in the period from year 1987 to 2008. For each of the two investigated features visibility of root canals and visibility of parodontal gap was developed a subdivision into four stages, and statistical quantities as well as maxima and minima were determined. Superposition with anatomical features in the radiation path made impossible the evaluation of the upper third molar. For both sexes the minima and medians were increasing with the progressing stage. From the available initial stages (P 0 or W 0) the assured determination of reaching the age of 18 was impossible. However, it was possible for the more advanced stages P 1 -P 3 or W 2 -W 3.

30|$|The {{surgical}} treatment of ORN patients is challenging. Several {{factors contribute to}} this difficulty. Patients who have received radiation therapy have impaired wound-healing capacity, and some have had previous neck dissection, resulting {{in the destruction of}} tissue planes. In a study of carotid-artery images in <b>orthopantograms</b> of 122 patients, Friedlander et al. [27] concluded that patients with total radiation doses sufficient to cause ORN are at a higher risk of developing carotid-artery atherosclerotic lesions than age-matched non-irradiated controls. Careful and delicate dissection and the use of contralateral side vessels for anastomosis can overcome some of these difficulties [28]. Selection of the FFF is important when available vessels are present in the contralateral side. Interposition of vein graft is possible; however, it takes longer time than end-to-end anastomosis at the contralateral side. Our selection criteria are useful, and flaps were all successful when contralateral side anastomosis was performed. Our study involved eight patients with mandibulectomy and fibular reconstruction. Further studies with large number of patients or multicenter study are need.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Orthopantomography plays a great role to {{categorise}} {{the lesion}} {{according to its}} location and relationship with respect to tooth. It is simple and cost effective. Orthopantomography can provide clue regarding the aggressiveness of the lesion and therefore a radiologist can provide an idea as to which lesion can be left alone and which lesion require therapy or surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with specific complaint pertaining to lower jaw, pain in the lower jaw, discharge from mouth, etc. were studied by <b>orthopantogram</b> examination. The machine use for the study is D. B. Troniks and {{the duration of the}} study is one year from January 2016 to December 2016. RESULTS A study of 50 patients were carried out at our institute having symptoms and sign pertaining to lower jaw. Maximum cases were found in fourth decade. Males were more affected than females. On radiographic features, most lesions were mixed followed by sclerotic and then lytic. Most common benign malignant lesion found in our studies was squamous cell carcinoma followed by multiple myeloma. CONCLUSION The orthopantomography examination is very useful and important diagnostic aid in diagnosis of these mandibular lesions, as it is a simple and nontraumatic procedure.

40|$|Purpose: The {{quality of}} <b>orthopantogram</b> (OPG) images is {{primarily}} a function of patient positioning during image capture. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate the quality of digital panoral radiographic images obtained by using the same imaging device in a large dental treatment center {{on the basis of}} the radiography technician operator securing the image. Materials and Methods: Three hundred OPGs radiographs taken on a Kodak 8000 C Digital Panoramic and Cephalometric System device in a large dental treatment center comprised the sample. The most recent OPGs beginning at May 2010 through 2007 were selected for three radiography technicians until subgroups of 100 OPGs per technician were obtained. Each panoral was evaluated by two investigators for 21 OPG image errors. Results: Mean panoral total score was 14. 71 and mean grade was 2. 41 for the entire sample indicating a “good” quality. Significant differences were found among technicians for 3 of 21 panoral fault variables. The relative contribution to inferior OPG quality was greatest for the following positioning faults in rank order: Gazebo effect (11. 3 %), condyles pushed out (11. 0 %), unclear nasal structures (10. 0 %), airspace over U 6 s (9. 5 %), and condyles image top (9. 0 %). Conclusions: There were no significant differences among technicians for overall quality indicators (total score and grade).

Successful management relies on ac-curate {{diagnosis of the}} fracture, {{which leads to the}} determination of optimal treatment. We present a case of a fractured mandible with vertical fractures of both condyles and the parasymphisis in a child, which was difficult to diagnose using conventional radiological interpretation. The initial radiographs did not fully reveal the nature of the condylar trauma and computed tomography was necessary to clarify the extent of the injuries. Management was a combination of open reduction internal fixation for the parasymphyseal fracture, and orthodontic brackets were cemented to the teeth to allow elastic traction and conservative management of the condylar fractures, which involved both temporomandibular joints. The patient made an unremarkable postoperative recovery and had regained excellent range of motion within 2 weeks of surgery.

For statistical evaluation, descriptive statistics was used to compare deviations of the mean values of chronological and dental age in each age group. The resulting difference between dental age and chronological age is not significant in both genders only when using both Demirjian 7 -teeth methods of 1973 and 1976. Therefore these may be most appropriately used for forensic age estimation. There are shown standard deviation differences in different countries.

Material and methods: A database of 1400 patients scanned with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was searched for matching periapical (PA) radiographs and <b>orthopantogram</b> (OPG) images of maxillary premolars and molars. Matching OPG images datasets of 101 patients with 628 teeth and PA radiographs datasets of 93 patients with 359 teeth were identified. Four observers assessed the relationship between the apex of tooth root and the maxillary sinus per tooth on PA radiographs, OPG and CBCT images using the following classification: root tip is in the sinus (class 1), root tip is against the sinus wall (class 2) and root tip is not in the sinus (class 3). Results: Overall correlation between OPG and CBCT images scores was 50 %, 26 % and 56. 1 % for class 1, class 2 and class 3, respectively (Cohen’s kappa [weighted] = 0. 1). Overall correlation between PA radiographs and CBCT images was 75. 8 %, 15. 8 % and 56. 9 % for class 1, class 2 and class 3, respectively (Cohen’s kappa [weighted] = 0. 24). In both the OPG images and the PA radiographs datasets, class 1 correlation was most frequently observed with the first and second molars.

Patient {{with a history of}} left hip arthroplasty presented with acute onset of fever, pain and limited range of motion of the left hip. Arthrocentesis of the affected joint yielded purulent fluid and exchange of mobile parts of the prosthesis, but retention of fixed components was performed. Granulicatella para-adiacens grew from preoperative and intraoperative cultures, including sonication fluid of the removed implant. The transesophageal echocardiography showed a vegetation on the mitral valve; the <b>orthopantogram</b> demonstrated a periapical dental abscess.

Various methods are available for surgical correction. We have reviewed our experience with the efficacy of different interpositional materials in post-traumatic cases in our set up with special reference to temporal fascia over last three years. Twenty seven patients with history of trauma, mostly fall from height, have been studied. They were evaluated clinically and by computed tomography (CT) scan, <b>orthopantogram</b> and x- ray lateral oblique view. The most common age group was 10 - 15 years with mean 12. 5 years and male to female ratio 1 : 2. Preoperative mouth opening (inter incisor distance) was 1 - 2 mm in 17 cases and 2 - 4 mm in 10 cases. We have used temporalis fascia in nine, costochondral graft in seven, silastic sheets in five and T-plates in six cases. Post-operatively, adequate mouth opening of 30 - 50 mm was observed in six months follow-up and more than 50 mm at one year follow up in 21 cases out of which nine cases have interpositional material as temporalis fascia alone. The postoperative period was uneventful in all cases and none required re-operation for recurrences.

Method and Material: Forty patients were evaluated, of which a “cases” group was formed by 25 patients wearing mandibular overdentures on 2 lower jaw implants and fully-removable dentures on the opposite arch. The other 15 patients formed a control group that wore fully-removable dentures on both arches. Each one of the patients underwent <b>orthopantograms</b> from the moment the dentures were inserted until an average of 6 years later, which were assessed based on the Xie et al. method to estimate vertical bone loss. Once the data was collected, it was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: In terms of the maxillary midline, we observed a greater loss in patients wearing overdentures, which was statistically significant, as it registered 0. 32 mm/year. Mandibular bone loss was 2. 5 times less in patients in the cases group. The rest of the clinical criteria for Kelly’s Combination Syndrome were not observed.

40|$|Faulty radiographs have poor {{diagnostic}} quality, and {{repetition of}} such poor-quality radiographs leads to increased patient exposure to radiation. Since digital panoramic radiography has replaced manual radiography, the only hindrance in producing good-quality radiographs is the positioning errors. Objectives: Our study aims {{to determine the}} various positioning errors and their relative frequency and to identify those errors directly responsible for diagnostically inadequate images. Materials and Methods: Five hundred panoramic radiographs taken serially (from the year 2007) were retrospectively assessed for the positioning errors by three oral and maxillofacial radiology specialists using a performa enlisting the errors. The three specialists had different duration of clinical experience and they evaluated the <b>orthopantograms</b> as diagnostically acceptable or unacceptable. They also observed the relative frequency of all the positioning errors. Statistical Analysis: The kappa value for intraobserver agreement was calculated, which suggested that the agreement among the observers was fair.

Therefore, on cephalometric radiographs, the most accurate age-estimating skeletal variable and related registration method were searched and added to a regression model, with age as response and third molar stages as explanatory variable. In a pilot set up on a dataset of 496 (283 M; 213 F) cephalometric radiographs, the techniques of Baccetti et al. (2005) (BA), Seedat et al. (2005) (SE), Caldas et al. (2007) and Rai et al.

In the main study, data from 460 (208 F, 224 M) individuals in an age range between 3 and 26 years, for which at the same day an <b>orthopantogram</b> and a cephalogram were taken, were collected. On the orthopantomograms, the left third molar development was registered using the scoring system described by Gleiser and Hunt (1955) and modified by Köhler (1994) (GH). On the cephalograms, cervical vertebrae development was registered according to the BA and SE techniques. A regression model, with age as response and the GH scores as explanatory variable, was fitted to the data. Next, information of BA, SE and BA + SE was, respectively, added to this model. From all obtained models, the determination coefficients and the root mean squared errors were calculated. Inclusion of information from cephalograms based on the BA, {{as well as the}} SE, technique improved the amount of explained variance in age acquired from panoramic radiographs using the GH technique with 48 %. Inclusion of cephalometric BA + SE information marginally improved the previous result (+ 1 %). The RMSE decreased with 1. 93, 1. 85 and 2. 03 years by adding, respectively, BA, SE and BA + SE information to the GH model.

40|$|Background: Impaction of the {{permanent}} maxillary canines, which is a common problem in dentistry, may require surgery and long-term orthodontic treatment. Until now, impaction has mostly been linked to physical obstructions and the direction of movement of the tooth. However, the molecular co-ordination of bone formation and bone resorption necessary for the eruption process, which is suggested to be regulated by the dental follicle, needs to be investigated further. Aims: The overall objectives of this thesis were to determine which clinical factors are related to impacted canines, and to investigate the regulatory functions and differentiation potential of the dental follicle. Patients and methods: The positions of impacted and normally erupting canines (<b>orthopantograms),</b> the skeletal variables (profile radiographs), and dento-alveolar traits (casts) were evaluated as potential predictive factors for impaction using a multivariate data analysis (N= 90 patients). The gene expression profiles of boneregulatory markers were determined by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining of human dental follicles. Whole dental follicles (N= 11) obtained from impacted canines, with or without signs of root resorption, and from control teeth (normal erupting teeth and mesiodens), together with the apical (N= 15) and coronal (N= 15) segments (processed independently), were analysed. In vitro osteogenic differentiation of human dental follicle cells (hDFC) {{was followed by the}} quantification of gene expression of osteoblast-phenotypic markers and Alizarin Red staining. Quantifications of the molecular permeability of gap junctional intercellular communication and of CX 43 expression were performed with the dye parachute technique and flow cytometry, respectively. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics processing were used for the identification of differentially regulated genes and pathways involved in the differentiation of hDFC. Results: Clinical variables related to the spatial location of the un-erupted tooth exert the strongest influences on impaction. However, they cannot be attributed to the cause of impaction, and they cannot be used as predictors. The RT-qPCR analyses revealed that the transcript levels for osteoclast-related markers (M-CSF, MCP- 1, RANKL) were minimally expressed compared to those for osteoblastic markers (RUNX 2, COL- 1, OSX, ALP, OCN). No differential patterns of expression were identified between the impacted canines, with or without clinical signs of root resorption, or compared to the follicles from mesiodens or the normally erupting teeth. When the apical and coronal sections were analysed independently, significant differential expression was detected for the RANKL gene in the coronal part of the dental follicles, as compared with their corresponding apical parts. The induced expression levels of RANKL and OPG in cultured hDFC obtained from different patients were also significantly different. CX 43 was observed to be highly expressed in the follicular tissues, and its expression was increased when the cells were cultured in osteogenic medium, and even further enhanced when the cells were exposed to silica (Si). We found that multipotent stem cells residing in the dental follicle could be induced to differentiate towards an osteoblastic lineage under favourable in vitro conditions, resulting in regulation of the osteoblastic phenotypic markers (RUNX 2, OSX, BMP 2, ALP, and OCN) and active deposition of a mineralised matrix. In addition, Si enhanced osteogenic differentiation in combination with osteogenic induction medium, as revealed by increases in the expression of CX 43 and gap junction communication activity in the hDFC. Conclusions: The results presented in the thesis reveal that clinical variables are influential, but not determinants, for tooth impaction. The dental follicle in the late pre-eruptive stage mainly expresses osteoblastregulatory markers, whereas the levels of osteoclast-related markers are very low. Significant expression of CX 43 and gap junction communication activity were detected, indicating an important role for these factors in the functional processes in the dental follicle. The significant upregulation of RANKL expression in the coronal part of the dental follicles suggests the importance of recruiting and activating osteoclasts, so as to form the eruption path through the alveolar bone. Moreover, the differential expression of induced RANKL in cultured hDFC may explain the diversity of events noted in the clinical setting during tooth eruption. Mesenchymal cells located in the dental follicle provide the optimal precursors, which can be cultured under in vitro conditions and further triggered with Si to differentiate towards an osteoblastic lineage...|$|R
40|$|In der vorliegenden Studie wurde die metrische Genauigkeit verschiedener röntgenologischer Verfahren zur präimplantologischen Diagnostik untersucht. Das Standardverfahren der Orthopantomographie und das noch im experimentellen Stadium befindliche Verfahren der Flächendetektor-Volumencomputertomographie (engl. {{flat panel}} {{volumetric}} computed tomography, VCT) wurden zu diesem Zweck mit realen Schnittpräparaten humaner Unterkiefer verglichen. Im Bereich der Orthopantomographie kamen fünf Geräte sowohl konventioneller als auch digitaler Technik zum Einsatz. Das Hauptaugenmerk lag auf der Darstellung des im Unterkiefer verlaufenden Canalis mandibulae und des crestal befindlichen Knochenangebotes. Insbesondere ist dabei die Distanz von dem Oberrand des Canalis mandibulae zum crestalen Alveolarkammrand von Bedeutung. Die Untersuchung wurde an 18 Kopfpräparatehälften durchgeführt. An ihnen wurden röntgenopake Marker fixiert, die an definierten Stellen den Vergleich der röntgenologischen Verfahren mit den realen Schnittpräparaten erlaubten. Die röntgenopaken Marker wurden sowohl in horizontaler als auch vertikaler Dimension vermessen. Zusätzlich wurde der Abstand vom crestalen Alveolarkammrand zum Oberrand des Canalis mandibulae bestimmt. In der vertikalen Dimension variierten bei den fünf Orthopantomographieverfahren die maximalen Vergrößerungsfaktoren von 1, 15 bis 1, 23. Für jedes der fünf Orthopantomographieverfahren wurde der durchschnittliche vertikale Vergrößerungsfaktor ermittelt. Die Werte lagen zwischen 1, 05 und 1, 13. In der Horizontalen variierten die maximalen Vergrößerungsfaktoren der fünf Orthopantomographieverfahren von 1, 16 bis 1, 37. Ebenso wurde der durchschnittliche horizontale Vergrößerungsfaktor für jedes der fünf Orthopantomographieverfahren bestimmt. Die Werte lagen zwischen 1, 05 und 1, 15. Bei dem Verfahren der VCT unterschieden sich die Werte in der Vertikalen und Horizontalen nur geringfügig von den realen Schnittpräparaten. Der durchschnittliche Vergrößerungsfaktor lag in der Vertikalen bei 1, 01, in der Horizontalen bei 1, 00. Aufgrund der Abweichung des maximalen Vergrößerungsfaktors zum durchschnittlichen Vergrößerungsfaktor ist zu empfehlen, dass für die präimplantologische Diagnostik und Planung eine metrische Auswertung von Orthopantomogrammen nicht auf der Annahme konstanter Vergrößerungsfaktoren, sondern auf einem Vergleich mit in situ befindlichen Referenzobjekten basieren sollte. Innerhalb der präimplantologischen Diagnostik ist besonders die Abstandsmessung vom crestalen Alveolarkammrand zum Oberrand des Canalis mandibulae zu beachten. Hierbei variierte bei den fünf verschiedenen Orthopantomographieverfahren die Nichtbeurteilbarkeit des Oberrandes von 15, 3 bis 25, 0 %, bei der VCT hingegen lag sie bei 2, 8 %. Bei der Abstandsmessung vom crestalen Alveolarkammrand zum Oberrand des Canalis mandibulae betrug der maximale Vergrößerungsfaktor bei der VCT 1, 05. Innerhalb der fünf Orthopantomographieverfahren variierten die maximalen Vergrößerungsfaktoren von 1, 34 bis 1, 49. Der maximale Vergrößerungsfaktor der Orthopantomographie bei der Abstandsmessung vom crestalen Alveolarkammrand zum Oberrand des Canalis mandibulae ist damit höher als bei den Vermessungen der eindeutig sichtbaren röntgenopaken Marker. Bei dem Umgang mit der bildbearbeitenden Software für die Datensätze der VCT-Aufnahmen war subjektiv eine im Vergleich zu anderen dreidimensionalen Röntgentechniken beeindruckende Detailerkennbarkeit festzustellen, insbesondere bei knöchernen Strukturen. Derzeit ist die VCT im experimentellen Stadium und noch nicht für Untersuchungen am lebenden Menschen zugelassen. Die Größe der zu untersuchenden Objekte ist im Dual-Panel-Mode auf 13, 6 cm in der xy-Ebene und 21 cm in der z-Richtung beschränkt. Weitere Untersuchungen hinsichtlich der Strahlenbelastung und der Beurteilbarkeit der Knochendichte stehen noch aus, bevor die VCT eventuell zu einer ergänzenden präimplantologischen Röntgendiagnostik herangezogen werden kann. In {{the present study}} the metric precision of different radiological procedures is investigated for their application in pre-implantological diagnostics. For this purpose, standard procedures of orthopantomography {{as well as the}} procedure of flat panel volumetric computed tomography (VCT), still in the trial phase, were applied and compared with real preparations of human lower jaw. For the orthopantomography a total of five apparatuses of both conventional and digital technology were applied. The main focus was on the presentation of the mandibular canal (lower jaw) and the crestally located bone structures. Of particular significance was the distance between the upper edge of the mandibular canal and the crestal alveolar ridge. The investigation was carried out on 18 preparations of cranial halves. To these radiographical opaque markers were fixed, which allowed for comparison of different radiological procedures with real preparations at defined anatomical sites. Quantification of the radiographical opaque markers occurred in horizontal and vertical dimensions. In addition, the distance between the crestal alveolar ridge and the upper ridge of the mandibular canal were determined. The maximal augmentation factors of the vertical dimension of the five orthopantomograhic procedures varied in values from 1. 15 - 1. 23. For each of the five orthopantomographic procedures the average vertical augmentation factor was determined. The values ranged from 1. 05 - 1. 13. In the horizontal dimension the maximal augmentation factors of the five orthopantomographies varied in values from 1. 16 - 1. 37. Likewise, as carried out for the vertical dimension, the average horizontal augmentation factor was determined for each of the five orthopantomographic procedures. The values were between 1. 05 - 1. 15. In the case of the VCT, the values of the vertical and horizontal dimension displayed only minimal discrepancies from the real preparations of human lower jaw. The average of the augmentation factor for the vertical dimension was 1. 01, for the horizontal dimension the average was 1. 00. For the purpose of preimplantational diagnostics and planning, it is recommended that because of the deviation of the maximal augmentation factor from the average augmentation factor, any metric validation of the <b>orthopantograms</b> not be based on constant augmentation factors, but instead in relation to in situ. Regarding the preimplantological diagnostics, particular attention must be paid to the distance between the crestal alveolar ridge and the upper ridge of the mandibular canal. For all five different orthopantomographies the percentage of cases in which {{it was not possible to}} evaluate the upper edge of the mandibular canal varied from 15. 3 - 25 %, whereas for the VCT it was only 2. 8 %. The measurement of the distance between the crestal alveolar ridge and the upper edge of the mandibular canal displayed a maximum augmentation factor for the VCT of 1. 05. Amongst the five orthopantomographies the values of the maximal augmentation factors varied from 1. 34 - 1. 49. The maximal augmentation factor obtained for the measurement of the distance between the crestal alveolar ridge and the upper edge of the mandibular canal was thus higher than that obtained with the clearly visible radiographic opaque markers in the orthopantomographies. In handling the image software for the datasets of the VCT images, the details identified were impressive when subjectively compared to other three-dimensional radiology techniques, in particular with osseous structures. Currently, VCT is in pilot phase and it has, as yet, not been licensed as a diagnostic tool. Its limitations lie in the size of its investigational objects, which are restricted in the dual-pane-mode to 13. 6 cm for the xy-plane, and to 21 cm for the z-plane. Further investigations will need to be carried out in the future with regard to the radiation load and assessability of bone density, before VCT can possibly play a part in pre-implantological radiodiagnostics...|$|R
