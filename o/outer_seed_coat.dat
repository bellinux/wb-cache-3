The effect of crude extract from the <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> <b>coats</b> of annatto on the inflammatory was investigated to determine its antiimflamation potency. Design and Method: This study was post test only control group design. Twenty four mice is selected randomly then divided into four groups, KI (extract 0. 09 mg), K. II (extract 0. 18 mg dose), K. III (aspirin 90 mg), and K. IV (CMCNa 0. 125 %). Oedema volume was measured before injection karagenin 1 %, two, 2. 5, three and four hours after injection karagenin. The mean reduction in inflammation were tested by one way anova and pos hoc LSD. Result: Greatest reduction in inflammation indicated by K. III (0. 100 ml), then in K.

The lectin occurs predominantly in the <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> tissues (<b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> and <b>seed</b> epidermis), {{where it is}} associated, at least in part, with the cell walls. Developing D. stramonium seeds secrete newly synthesized lectin polypeptides into the incubation medium, which confirms the extracellular location of the lectin. Imbibition of mature decoated seeds results in a rapid and highly specific release of lectin. Indeed, imbibition solutions contain almost exclusively the lectin together with a few other carbohydrate-binding proteins; this {{is indicative of the}} predominance of these proteins in the seed surface layer.

50|$|PMMoV is a rigid rod shaped virus {{pathogen}} {{that can}} be easily transmitted to healthy plants via mechanical inoculation or contact between plants or another medium that can carry the pathogen such as hands, gloves, and clothing. The virus is commonly found on the <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> and very rarely in the endosperm of seeds of the infected plants. Being seedborne, the virus primarily infects through mechanical contamination during seed transplanting and other agricultural procedures. It enters the plant/seed through microscopic abrasions or wounds. The virus is in vitro, which in this case means it can survive in an isolated environment, and being highly infectious it can easily be transmitted during normal crop maintenance. PMMoV is exceptionally stable and it is known to survive for extended periods of time in plant debris and on greenhouse structures, pots, and horticultural tools. There are no known insect vectors; however, humans can be considered the main vector for this pathogen.|$|E

Additionally, seeds can be re-dried and stored for later use or ground into a flour that can be used to make porridge. Roasted seeds can also serve as a substitute for coffee.Modern uses of B. senegalensis seeds are being developed in Niger Republic. They include cakes, cookies, bread, canned and popped seeds.

Scarification, clipping and dry heat were used to break dormancy in smooth loofah seed at the Department of Horticulture, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. A completely randomized design with 20 treatments was used involving: untreated seed (control), clipping, scarifying by scarifier at 40, 70 and 100  revolutions per minute (rpm) for 1  min, and dry heat at 60  °C, 70  °C and 80  °C for 1 – 5  h. After breaking dormancy, seed germination was tested in four replicates, with 50 seeds per replicate. The thickness of the <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> was measured under a digital microscope. The results showed that clipped seeds gave the highest germination (100 %) and decreased mean germination time (3. 58  d). Scarified seed using a scarifier at 70 and 100  rpm for 1  min resulted in germination rates of 67. 0 – 75. 5 %, which was higher than for seeds scarified at 40  rpm. The dry heat-treated seeds at 60  °C for 3 – 5  h and at 70  °C for 2 – 5  h had germination of 71. 0 – 80. 5 %. The <b>outer</b> layer of <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> scarified at 100  rpm for 1  min was thinner than those of un-scarified seed samples.

30|$|The seed coat protects {{developing}} embryos from drying {{and mechanical}} injury that {{is derived from}} the integument tissue (Bewley and Black [1994]). In the mature seeds of orchids, the seed coat is usually composed of one (epiphytic orchids, e.g. Phalaenopsis) or two (terrestrial orchids, e.g. Cypripedium) thin layers (Yam et al. [2002]; Lee et al. [2005]; Lee et al. [2008]). In C. javanica, two layers of the seed coat, i.e. the thickened <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> and the thin inner seed coat are present as the seeds matured (Figure  4 C). It is worthy to note that the <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> is derived from four layers of cells, and the outermost cell layer has become thickened at the early globular stage (Figure  4 A and B). Mature seeds of several vanilloid species are very hard because the walls of seed coats are heavily thickened with perhaps the lignin polymers (Cameron and Chase [1998]; Nishimura and Yukawa [2010]). In Vanilla (a close related genus of Cyrtosia), the walls of seed coats heavily thickened with the caffeyl alcohol derived lignin polymers are recently identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Chen et al. [2012]). In this study, the histochemical staining of the <b>outer</b> <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> reveals that the cell walls contain phenolic substances, indicating the accumulation of lignin in the thicken seed coat (Figure  4 C). The sclerotization in the outer seedcoat has been observed in some basal orchid groups, such as Apostasia (the subfamily Apostasioideae) and Vanilla (the subfamily Vanilloideae), suggesting a plesiomorphic character of the seed in Orchidaceae (Nishimura and Tamura [1993]; Nishimura and Yukawa [2010]). Several vanilloid orchids, such as Cyrtosia, Erythrorchis, Galeola and Vanilla are different from most orchids by having fleshy fruits. As the fruits of Cyrtosia and Vanilla matured, they start to turn red (Figure  1 B) or have fragrances to attract the visiting of bats or birds (Soto Arenas and Dressler [2010]). Therefore, it is suggested that the lignification of seed coat could protect the embryo survival when pass through the alimentary canal of animals (Rodolphe et al. [2011]). C. javanica is a fully mycoheterotrophic orchid species, and the seeds mature just within a month (according to Nishimura and Yukawa ([2010]), the seeds of Vanilla require six months for maturation). The mechanisms that allow for formation of lignin polymers within a short period remain to be investigated.|$|E

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of time of harvest on soybean seed quality (seed composition, germination, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and lignin) in high germinability (HG) breeding lines (50 % exotic) developed under high heat. The hypothesis was that seeds of HG lines possess physiological and genetic traits for a better seed quality at harvest maturity and delayed harvest. A 2 -year field experiment was conducted under irrigated conditions. Results showed that, at harvest maturity, the exotic HG lines had higher seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, but lower seed oil compared with the non-exotic checks (Control), confirming our hypothesis. At 28 days after harvest maturity (delayed harvest), the content of seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin were higher in some of the HG lines compared with the checks, indicating a possible involvement of these seed constituents, especially <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin, in maintaining <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> integrity and protecting <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> against physical damage. Highly significant positive correlations were found between germination and seed protein, oleic acid, sugars, and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> lignin. Highly significant negative correlation was found between germination and oil, linoleic acid, <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> wrinkling, shattering, and hard seed. Yields of some HG lines were competitive with checks. This research demonstrated that time of harvesting is an important factor influencing seed protein and oil production. Also, since high oleic acid is desirable for oxidative stability, shelf-life and biodiesel properties, using HG lines could positively influence these important traits. This result should suggest to breeders of some of the advantages of selecting for high <b>seed</b> <b>coat</b> boron and lignin, and inform growers of the importance of timely harvest for maintaining high seed quality...|$|R
