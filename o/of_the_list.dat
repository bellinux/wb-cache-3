5|$|In early April 2009, {{a carbon}} copy of one version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> was {{discovered}} at the State Library of New South Wales by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by author Thomas Keneally. The 13-page document, yellow and fragile, was filed among research notes and original newspaper clippings. The document {{was given to}} Keneally in 1980 by Pfefferberg when he was persuading him to write Schindler's story. This version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> contains 801 names and is dated 18 April 1945; Pfefferberg is listed as worker number 173. Several authentic versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> exist, because the names were re-typed several times as conditions changed in the hectic days {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|The Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony {{between the}} dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The {{names of the}} Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> and those kings were {{correlated}} with historical kings {{that belonged to the}} second city. However, an undamaged copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names bears no resemblance to any of the historically attested monarchs of the second city, indicating that the compilers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second city.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{architectural}} {{and artistic}} value, the Church of St George {{has been part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927. With the reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> in the 1960s, it was included on it both as an architectural and as an artistic monument, in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Together with the native house of Dimitar Peshev and the city art gallery, since 2010 it has been listed as number 26 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} ever, the NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{promoted}} {{the use of}} written records during his reign. Hungarian chronicles from the 14th century even state that {{he was responsible for}} the establishment of the Royal Chancery.

He was the wealthiest European monarch of his time, according to a list of his revenues, but the reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> is questioned.|$|E

5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While {{it is often difficult}} to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed {{near the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E

Bradford won the trophy with 1,726 total points, and McCoy finished second with 1,604 points in the Heisman voting.|$|E
