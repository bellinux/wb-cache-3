In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring spinning spindles installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in Asia or Oceania and 44% being within China. In {{the same year}} there were 7,975,000 <b>open</b> <b>end</b> <b>spinning</b> rotors installed, with 44% of these being within Asia or Oceania and 29% within Eastern Europe.

40|$|An <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>spin</b> chain can {{serves as}} a quantum data bus for the {{coherent}} transfer of quantum state information. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of such quantum spin channels which work in a decoherence environment. Our results show that, the decoherence will highly reduce the fidelity of quantum communication through the spin channels. As the distance increases, the decoherence effects become more serious, which will put some constraints on the spin chains for long distance quantum state transfer...|$|R
40|$|We use {{fidelity}} {{to characterize the}} information about a quantum state contained in another quantum state. In a multi-qubit system, each qubit has individual information about a prescribed quantum state. We investigate how the total information changes under the interactions of nonlocal Hamiltonians. We show that for some special physical interactions the total information is conserved. This type of nonlocal Hamiltonians are named as Conservative Hamiltonians, similar to the Conservative Forces. We then apply this Information Conservation Law in the quantum spin system, and propose methods for improving the efficiency of quantum communications through an <b>open</b> <b>end</b> <b>spin</b> chain...|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on the twisting process in friction spinning. In friction spinning, the fibres are applied twist with more or less {{one at a time}} without cyclic differentials in tension in the twisting zone. Therefore, fibre migration may not take place in friction spun yarns. The mechanism of twist insertion for core type friction <b>spinning</b> and <b>open</b> <b>end</b> friction <b>spinning</b> are different,which are described below.|$|R

40|$|Using the DMRG method we {{calculate}} the surface spin correlation function, C_L(l) =, in the spin S= 3 / 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. For comparison we also investigate the S= 1 / 2 chain with S= 1 impurity <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> and the S= 1 chain. In the half-integer spin models the end-to-end correlations {{are found to}} decay to zero logarithmically, C_L(1) ∼ (L) ^- 2 d, with d= 0. 13 (2). We find no surface order, in clear contrast with {{the behavior of the}} S= 1 chain, where exponentially localized <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> induce finite surface correlations. The lack of surface order implies that <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> do not exist in the strict sense. However, the system possesses a logarithmically weakly delocalizing boundary excitation, which, for any chain lengths attainable numerically or even experimentally, creates the illusion of an <b>end</b> <b>spin.</b> This mode is responsible for the first gap, which vanishes asymptotically as Δ_ 1 ≈ (π v_S d) /(L L), where v_S is the sound velocity and d is the logarithmic decay exponent. For the half-integer spin models our results on the surface correlations and on the first gap support universality. Those for the second gap are less conclusive, due to strong higher-order corrections. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|Maple Mill {{was sold}} to Courtaulds in 1964. In 1968, Maple Mill was {{selected}} by Courtaulds to receive the first top secret BD 200s, <b>Open</b> <b>End</b> <b>Spinning</b> machines from Czechoslovakia. These were experimental, and coming without documentation were difficult to operate. Simply, they were designed for Uzbek cotton not the American cotton or synthetics used in Oldham. A research visit by Courtaulds staff to Ústí nad Labem in August 1968, was interrupted by Soviet tanks putting down the Prague spring uprising. Later a body of Czech technicians was based at Maple Mill, until the problems had been resolved. This was a rare example of cross Iron Curtain co-operation. Courtaulds ceased cotton spinning at the mill in 1991, but it was re-opened a year later by Wills Fabrics Ltd who continued spinning and weaving on the site until the company went into administration 1998.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a process to}} create quasi long-range quantum discord between the non-interacting <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> of a quantum spin chain, with the <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> weakly coupled to {{the bulk of the}} chain. The process is not only capable of creating long-range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen, when certain weak end-couplings are adiabatically varied below certain thresholds. We term this phenomenon as adiabatic freezing of quantum correlation. We observe that the freezing is robust to moderate thermal fluctuations and is intrinsically related to the cooperative properties of the quantum spin chain. In particular, we find that the energy gap of the system remains frozen for these adiabatic variations, and moreover, considering the <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> as probes, we show that the interval of freezing can detect the anisotropy transition in quantum XY spin chains. Importantly, the adiabatic freezing of long-range quantum correlations can be simulated with contemporary experimental techniques.

40|$|We {{investigate}} frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin chains at T= 0 for S= 3 / 2 and S= 2 {{using the}} DMRG method. We localize disorder and Lifshitz points, confirming that quantum disorder points {{can be seen}} as quantum remnants of classical phase transitions. Both in the S= 3 / 2 and the S= 2 chain, we observe the disappearance of effectively free S= 1 / 2 and S= 1 <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> respectively. The frustrated spin chain is therefore a suitable system for clearly showing the existence of free <b>end</b> <b>spins</b> S'=[S/ 2] also in half-integer antiferromagnetic spin chains with S> 1 / 2.

The forming limit defined by seisure is decreased according to increment of die revolution and conical angle of die and is increased according to increment of ram pressure. 2. Under a certain die revolution, seisure is occored at the approximately same time and this is not depend on ram pressure. 3.

Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings.
