5|$|You made me very low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes. Yours sincerely, Mary.|$|E
2500|$|At {{almost six}} feet tall, Parr's {{strength}} {{was said to}} be one of her greatest assets. She was particularly noted for the power of her kicking, both in delivering from the left flank and shooting at goal. Team mate Joan Whalley later wrote: [...] "She had a kick like a mule. She was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> knew who could lift a dead ball, the old heavy leather ball, from the left wing over to me on the right and nearly knock me out with the force of the shot..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In one {{edition of}} The Mark Thomas Comedy Product, Mark Thomas {{investigated}} {{the practice of}} avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law. In 2015, Thomas told The Independents Adam Jacques: [...] "I {{try to find the}} good in my enemies. It's not unusual {{to be able to get}} on with people despite what they are doing being awful. The <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> have met who I considered to be without any redeeming features was [...] Nicholas Soames. [...] He was such a pantomime baddie." ...|$|E

Still, ye and Mr. Maxwell were not the <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> saw that night at the Hallows Brig." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{ends with}} the song [...] "North Star," [...] {{which serves as a}} [...] "closing credits" [...] type of song. In regard to this track and Popa Wu's inclusion, RZA later remarked [...] "The idea is Rae did {{everything}} he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and ODB. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life." [...] Raekwon further commented [...] "'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album. It was a track that I felt a vibe of it was motion picture-like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cougar Town {{was created}} by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. Following the {{cancellation}} of Dirt, Courteney Cox wanted to return to television and do another comedy. Lawrence, who {{is best known as}} the creator of Scrubs and Spin City, was approached by Cox about [...] "wanting to do something". While developing the concept of the show, Lawrence thought he would do a tryout with Cox on Scrubs, by guest starring in the first three episodes of the eighth season. Lawrence and Biegel, who worked together writing episodes on Scrubs, came up with the concept of the show with Cox as a 40-year-old newly single woman because he thought that it was a real [...] "zeitgeist-y topic". He drew inspiration from his real-life wife, actress Christa Miller who also stars in the show as Ellie; Miller had previously worked with Cox as part of the story-arc of the three part Scrubs tryout. Lawrence told Cox that the show could be [...] "high risk, high reward", although Cox decided to go for it. He added, [...] "I rarely have this much trepidation because usually the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> could let down is myself. I want to make it work for her." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 January 1798, Hazlitt, in {{what was}} to prove {{a turning point in}} his life, {{encountered}} Coleridge as the latter preached at the Unitarian chapel in Shrewsbury. A minister at the time, Coleridge had as yet none of the fame that would later accrue to him as a poet, critic, and philosopher. Hazlitt, like Thomas de Quincey and many others afterwards, was swept off his feet by Coleridge's dazzlingly erudite eloquence. [...] "I {{could not have been more}} delighted if I had heard the music of the spheres", he wrote years later in his essay [...] "My First Acquaintance with Poets". It was, he added, as if [...] "Poetry and Philosophy had met together. Truth and Genius had embraced, under the eye and with the sanction of Religion." [...] Long after they had parted ways, Hazlitt would speak of Coleridge as [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> ever knew who answered to the idea of a man of genius". That Hazlitt learned to express his thoughts [...] "in motley imagery or quaint allusion", that his understanding [...] "ever found a language to express itself," [...] was, he openly acknowledged, something he owed to Coleridge. For his part, Coleridge showed an interest in the younger man's germinating philosophical ideas, and offered encouragement.|$|E

6000|$|... "Lady Angela," [...] I said, [...] "I must {{talk to some}} one. I do {{not know}} whom to trust. I do not know who is honest. You are the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> dare speak to at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I cannot {{write to}} her, for I {{am not sure}} that under the {{circumstances}} she would answer my letter. And I have already asked Mrs Null, the <b>only</b> other <b>person</b> <b>I</b> could ask, to speak for me, but she has declined." ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{political}} comedy show, The Mark Thomas Comedy Product (later renamed {{as simply}} The Mark Thomas Product, to reflect its increasing political agenda) on Channel 4 earned him criticism from politicians but {{was seen by}} critics as a crucial investigative tool. In one edition, Thomas investigated the practice of avoiding inheritance tax by declaring art, furniture, homes and land available for public viewing. After discovering that Conservative MP Nicholas Soames was claiming tax relief on a [...] "three-tier mahogany buffet with partially reeded slender balustrade upright supports" [...] on this basis, but without making any arrangements for the furniture to be inspected by the public, Thomas invented a 'National Soames Day' on which hundreds of people made appointments to see the furniture. Soames subsequently decided to pay the tax on the item and Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, changed the law.

5000|$|Rose has six [...] "half-siblings" [...] and she {{utilizes}} {{technology to}} feel {{closer to her}} family and friends [...] "back home". She says her grandmother is “probably the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who <b>I</b> stay in touch with every single day. We talk and text a lot. A lot, a lot.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{interests}} me very much; no one so much. I am sincerely, even deeply attached to him; {{but it is}} like your love, it is a sister's love. There is <b>only</b> one <b>person</b> <b>I</b> really love in the world, and alas! he does not love me!" [...] And her voice was tremulous.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is past; on the contrary, I wish {{to speak}} to you; indeed, you are the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> with whom <b>I</b> could speak," [...] and she sat down.|$|R

2500|$|In October 1595 De Vere {{wrote to}} his brother in law, Sir Robert Cecil, of {{friction}} {{between himself and the}} ill-fated Earl of Essex, partly over his claim to the property, terming him 'the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> that <b>I</b> dare rely upon in the court'. [...] Cecil seems to have done little to further De Vere's interests in the suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he explained, [...] "I wasn't the <b>only</b> <b>person,</b> present, and <b>I</b> hadn't {{arrived at}} the beginning. Somebody should have stopped the fellow; the shares he tried to work off on Crestwick were no good." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I'm {{sorry for}} all the rough things I said to you, Daisy. I don't blame you for anything. You only acted {{according}} to your lights. The <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> can blame is myself. It's only reasonable that I should suffer the punishment.|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I came to Mr. Malise because he's the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{know with}} {{imagination}} {{enough to see}} what my position is; I came to him {{a quarter of an}} hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly suspect him. That is disgusting.|$|E

"Of course I knew Akim Soushiloff and Petroff Stepanoff; but I {{had only}} been in their rooms once before, and the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met there before was {{the young woman who}} called herself Katia, but who you say was {{somebody}} else.

6000|$|... "She had a fancy, and I am sure I do {{not know}} any {{companion}} I could prefer to her. She is the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> of whom <b>I</b> could truly say, that every time I see her, I love her more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but my fate is {{the fate}} of ages and of nations," [...] said Theodora, {{throwing}} up her head with that tumult of the brow which he had once before noticed.

60|$|DESCENDING to the ground-floor of the house, I sent {{to request}} a moment's {{interview}} with the landlady. I had yet to learn in which of the London prisons Van Brandt was confined; {{and she was the}} <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to whom <b>I</b> could venture to address the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll {{write to}} you when I’m fixed up," [...] said the skipper, [...] "giving you my new name and address.

6000|$|... 'I {{like your}} friend much, papa.

6000|$|... "It is of {{the utmost}} {{importance}} to me to know what is doing at Thorpe Ambrose; and it would be the height of rashness, while I am quite in the dark in this matter, to venture there myself.

5000|$|Following the album's aborted {{recording}} {{sessions with}} White, Smith revealed {{his desire to}} continue producing the band's material himself: [...] "We've had every modern-day producer flying at me like, 'Oh, this guy produced this band,' and it's some fucking band that I read about on Pitchfork two years ago. It's cool to get attention but, in the end, I'm a control freak and I have a very clear vision. I'm the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who <b>I</b> can trust to produce this record." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thank God that I have emotions, and I don't mind if I do show them. <b>I</b> was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who cried. <b>I</b> knew I should cry, and I brought three {{handkerchiefs}} on purpose.

5000|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with the Billings Gazette, Sheriff Sgt.
