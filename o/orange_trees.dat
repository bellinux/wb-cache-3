5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E

25|$|<b>Orange</b> <b>trees</b> {{generally}} are grafted. The {{bottom of the}} tree, including the roots and trunk, is called rootstock, while the fruit-bearing top has two different names: budwood (when referring {{to the process of}} grafting) and scion (when mentioning the variety of orange).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to grow <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> directly from seeds, {{but they may be}} infertile or produce fruit that may be different from its parent. For the seed of a commercial orange to grow, it must be kept moist at all times. One approach is placing the seeds between two sheets of damp paper towel until they germinate and then planting them, although many cultivators just set the seeds straight into the soil.|$|E
25|$|Trees from groves in hammocks or areas {{covered with}} pine forest are budded on sour <b>orange</b> <b>trees,</b> {{a method that}} gives a high solids content. On sand, they are grafted on rough lemon rootstock.

This cultivar is now the leading early orange in Florida and, possibly, in the rest of the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} pest that {{attacked}} <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> in the United States was the {{cottony cushion scale}} (Icerya purchasi), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia to study this scale insect in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of Novius cardinalis, an Australian ladybird beetle, and within a decade the pest was controlled.|$|E
25|$|Citrus fruits — {{among them}} the bitter orange — were {{introduced}} to Sicily in the 9th century {{during the period of}} the Emirate of Sicily, but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> into the Mediterranean area. Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It also was considered a luxury item and wealthy people grew oranges in private conservatories, called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Caillebotte painted many {{domestic}} and familial scenes, interiors, and portraits.

There are scenes of dining, card playing, piano playing, reading, and sewing, all executed in an intimate, unobtrusive manner that portrays the quiet ritual of upper-class indoor life.|$|E

25|$|Aydın {{city centre}} is still {{relatively}} small but growing, centred on one palm-lined avenue of shops and cafes, and {{a maze of}} narrow side streets, dotted with <b>orange</b> <b>trees.</b> The people are traditional and family-oriented, so there is little night life, or cultural amenities for young people, although presumably now they have a university this will change. There {{are a number of}} mosques, high schools, dersane (private courses cramming students for the university entrance exams) and other public buildings. Like all Turkish cities Aydın is now spreading as the middle-classes are leaving their flats in the city for smarter apartments or houses slightly out of town.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{travelers}} {{introduced the}} sweet orange into the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493, Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit in Hispaniola. Subsequent expeditions in the mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded St Augustine. Spanish missionaries brought <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> to Arizona between 1707 and 1710, while the Franciscans {{did the same}} in San Diego, California, in 1769. An orchard was planted at the San Gabriel Mission around 1804 and a commercial orchard was established in 1841 near present-day Los Angeles. In Louisiana, oranges were probably introduced by French explorers.|$|E
25|$|Long Garden or the 'Purdha Garden': This {{is located}} to the West of the Main Garden, and runs along {{on each side}} of the central {{pavement}} which goes to the circular garden. Enclosed in walls about 12 feet high, this is predominantly a rose garden. It has 16 square rose beds encased in low hedges. There is a red sandstone pergola in the centre over the central pavement which is covered with Rose creepers, Petrea, Bougainvillea and Grape Vines. The walls are covered with creepers like Jasmine, Rhyncospermum, Tecoma Grandiflora, Bignonia Vanista, Adenoclyma, Echitice, Parana Paniculata. Along the walls are planted the China <b>Orange</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E

25|$|Commercially grown <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting {{a mature}} cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions. Thus, rootstocks influence {{the rate of growth}} and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{planting of}} the garden {{is one of the}} Taj Mahal's remaining mysteries. The contemporary accounts mostly deal just with the architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned out a lot of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|E
