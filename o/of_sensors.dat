Observability analysis {{is a prerequisite for}} developing a systematic error estimation model. Therefore, an observability matrix is adopted to study the observability and observability degree <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> bias. Initially, {{based on the}} track-independent model, both state transformation and measurement models <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> bias are built in two dimensions to construct the observability matrix. Then, the observability <b>of</b> the <b>sensor</b> bias is studied by judging the singularity of the observability matrix. Further, the mathematical expression for the degree of observability is presented. Finally, several typical simulations to demonstrate the effect of degree of observability on the estimation accuracy <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> bias and the effects <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> location and target motion on the observability and observability degree <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> bias are provide...|$|R

5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E

No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance.

5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey.

Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting <b>of</b> <b>sensors</b> past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E

40|$|Objective-The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{construct}} a data accuracy model for the maximal set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes that sense a point event and forms a cluster with fully connected network between them. We determine the minimal set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes that are sufficient to give approximately the same data accuracy achieve by the maximal set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Design approach/Procedure-L set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes are randomly deployed over a region Z. Since a point event S has occurred in the region Z, M maximal set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes wake up and start sensing the point event. The set <b>of</b> M <b>sensor</b> nodes forms a cluster with fully connected network and remaining set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes continue to be in sleep mode. One sensor node is elected randomly as a cluster head (CH) node which can estimate the data accuracy for the cluster before data aggregation and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings - Since we simulate the data accuracy for the cluster (M set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes) at CH node, there exist P minimal set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes which give approximately the same data accuracy level achieve by M set <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. Moreover we find that as the distance from the point event to the number <b>of</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes increases, the data accuracy also get decreases. Design Limitation -This model is only applicable to estimate data accuracy for the point event where the sensed data are assumed to be spatially correlated with approximately same variations. Practical implementation-Detect point event e. g. fire in forest. Inventive/Novel idea - This is the first time that a data accuracy model is performed for the cluster before data aggregation at the CH node which can reduce data redundancy and communication overhead.
