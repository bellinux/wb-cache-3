Thermal and electrical characterization of the thermal bimorph actuators showed low influence in the platforms temperature and low power consumption (< 35 μW) mainly due to the natural isolation of the structure.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{intended}} to be a guide for the design of "microdynamically quiet" deployment mechanisms for optical-precision structures, such as deployable telescope mirrors and <b>optical</b> <b>benches.</b> Many of the guidelines included herein come directly from the field of optomechanical engineering, and are neither newly developed guidelines nor are they uniquely applicable to high-precision deployment mechanisms.
