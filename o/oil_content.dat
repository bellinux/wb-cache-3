5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the <b>oil</b> <b>content</b> is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E

40|$|Productivity {{improvement}} of physic nut {{can be done}} by the increase of female flowers numbers. Introducing of plant growth regulators (PGR) is one of many ways to stimulate flowering. The research was aimed to determine the dose of plant growth regulators NAA (Naphthalene Acetic Acid) which can increase the level of production and <b>oil</b> <b>contents.</b> This research was conducted at the Asembagus Experimental for 12 months. Five doses of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 ppm NAA were applied on two years old of J. curcas and arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. For comparison, treatment without PGR was added in treatments.
