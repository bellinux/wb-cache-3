5|$|In the {{investigation}} that followed, the evidence quickly pointed to Jereboam O. Beauchamp, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824. (She was a contemporary <b>of</b> <b>Sharp).</b> On November 11, 1825, a four-man posse arrested Beauchamp {{at his home}} in Franklin.|$|E

The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E

5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E
5|$|Strategic discussions also {{occurred}} on the German side, with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition.

A total of 1258 surveys were returned, a response rate of 55. 3 %. Participants responded to 12 true/false statements on the management <b>of</b> <b>sharps</b> and three questions about recapping practices. Most respondents were knowledgeable about the correct management <b>of</b> <b>sharps,</b> with a mean of 11. 28 (out of 12, SD = 1. 32). When gauging reported practices, more than half (59. 1 %, n = 736) of participants reported recapping a needle, and 38. 5 % (n = 479) reported never having done so. These results reflect good knowledge of general management <b>of</b> <b>sharps</b> among respondents, but suggest deficits regarding reported practices. The results suggest that a comprehensive ambulance in-service education programme focusing particularly on sharps management is required. The study highlights the need for further research on sharps management practices in the field, identification of barriers to safe sharps practices in pre-hospital settings, and 'best practice' for translating good sharps management knowledge into practice.

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset <b>of</b> <b>sharp,</b> one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|However, {{while no}} Australian units {{were engaged in}} {{operations}} there, many individuals did subsequently become involved through service with the British Army during the North Russia Campaign.

About 150 men of the Australian Imperial Force who were still in England awaiting repatriation following the end of World War I also enlisted as infantry in the North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), where they were involved in a number <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> battles. The Royal Australian Navy was involved too, with the destroyer HMAS Swan briefly engaged in an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian general, Anton Denikin.

A series <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> battles against the Arabs ensued at Um Rakhum, Gebel Medwa, and Halazin during December and January. The Western Desert Force, now under Major General William Peyton, re-occupied Sidi Barrani and Sallum in February and March 1916.

5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when Mary Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo.

Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E
5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing the landscape of the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation <b>of</b> <b>Sharp,</b> who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence <b>of</b> <b>sharp</b> peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
