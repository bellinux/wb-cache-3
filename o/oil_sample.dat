40|$|In this research, two <b>samples</b> of palm <b>oil</b> {{were studied}} {{with respect to}} the effect of {{temperature}} on the rheological properties of the palm <b>oil</b> <b>samples.</b> The types of oils under investigation were special palm oil and technical palm oil. It was observed that the palm <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> exhibit shear thinning property as a non-Newtonian fluid and its rheological properties like viscosity, shear stress and shear rate were affected by temperature as indicated on the experimental result. The viscosity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> were observed to decrease with increasing temperature, it was also observed that the variation of the viscosity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> could be attributed to the degree of purity of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples.</b> The degree of purity also depends on the method of preparation of the <b>oil</b> <b>samples.</b> Newtonian behavior occurs at low shear rate when the shear stress and shear rate relationship is linear.

40|$|Butter, {{margarine}} {{and butter}} oil are three products which consume daily by Iranian’scommunity. Detection of type and existence of synthetic antioxidants (SAs) quantities in the margarine, butter and butter <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> {{is so important}} in {{point of view of}} the safety. For this purpose, peroxide value (PV), oxidative stability (OS), iodine value (IV), fatty acid analysis (FA), type and amount of SAs, and its antioxidant activity (AA%) of the samples was determined as described methods of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) documents including ISO numbers: 3960, 6886, 3961, 5509, AOCS Ce 6 - 86, and DPPH assay, respectively. The direct relationship between the quantities of OS, SA and AA% was observed in the samples. It was observed that many of butter <b>oil</b> <b>samples</b> were without SA.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} method is based on optical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) where the optical absorbance, i.e. the fraction of intensity of the incident light that is absorbed by the <b>oil</b> <b>sample,</b> is used to estimate the oil acidity. An <b>oil</b> <b>sample</b> is placed in a cuvette and analyzed by a spectrophotometer {{on a wide range of}} wavelengths. The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The feasibility to measure olive oil free acidity and peroxide value by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726 cm−1 was reported. Many commercial spectrophotometers exist [...] that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil. The main advantage of NIR spectroscopy is the possibility to carry out the analysis on raw olive oil samples, without any chemical pretreatment. The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial spectrophotometer and the need of calibration for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).|$|E
