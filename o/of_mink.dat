5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species <b>of</b> <b>mink</b> {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with debate {{about whether or not the}} sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E

25|$|Each autumn, {{from late}} September through mid-October, mature kokanee salmon (Oncorhyncus nerka) {{transform}} from silver-blue color to a fiery vermilion, and run up Taylor Creek, near South Lake Tahoe. As spawning season approaches the fish acquire a humpback and protuberant jaw. After spawning they die and their carcasses provide a feast for gatherings <b>of</b> <b>mink</b> (Neovison vison), bears (Ursus americanus), and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). The non-native salmon were transplanted from the North Pacific to Lake Tahoe in 1944.|$|E

In 1962, Day {{appeared}} with Cary Grant in the comedy That Touch <b>of</b> <b>Mink,</b> the first film in history ever to gross $1 million in one theatre (Radio City Music Hall). During 1960 and the 1962 to 1964 period, she ranked number one at the box office, the second woman to be number one four times.

500|$|In 1960 Terry-Thomas {{appeared}} as Raymond Delauney in School for Scoundrels, a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called [...] "the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well-read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T {{the man as}} T-T the film star". He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and {{they were joined by}} Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. Michael Brooke, writing for the British Film Institute, thought Terry-Thomas was [...] "outstanding as a classic British bounder". Later the same year he appeared in Make Mine Mink as Major Albert Rayne, a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang <b>of</b> <b>mink</b> coat thieves with his female co-lodgers.

500|$|In 1960, Grant {{appeared}} opposite Robert Mitchum, Jean Simmons and Deborah Kerr in The Grass Is Greener, {{which was}} shot in England at Osterley Park and Shepperton Studios. McCann notes that Grant took great relish in [...] "mocking his aristocratic character's over-refined tastes and mannerisms", though the film was panned and was seen as his worst since Dream Wife. In 1962, Grant starred in the romantic comedy That Touch <b>of</b> <b>Mink,</b> playing suave, wealthy businessman Philip Shayne romantically involved with an office worker, played by Doris Day. He invites her to his apartment in Bermuda, but her guilty conscience begins to take hold. The picture was praised by critics, and it received three Academy Award nominations, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Picture, in addition to another Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination. Deschner ranked the film as the second highest grossing of Grant's career.|$|E
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} <b>of</b> <b>minks</b> was revised in 2000, {{resulting in}} the formation of a new genus Neovison which includes only the sea mink and the American mink.

50|$|The American mink replaces and {{sometimes}} kills the European mink wherever their ranges overlap. The decline <b>of</b> European <b>mink</b> populations seems {{to coincide with}} the spread <b>of</b> the American <b>mink.</b> The diets <b>of</b> the American <b>mink</b> and European otter overlap to a great extent. In areas where these two species are sympatric, competition with the otter for fish causes the American mink to hunt land-based prey more frequently.|$|R
40|$|Spleen {{samples from}} 14 mink that {{were trapped in}} 4 {{counties}} of Nova Scotia were tested for the presence <b>of</b> the Aleutian <b>mink</b> disease virus (AMDV) by polymerase chain reaction.

The high level <b>of</b> AMDV-infected <b>mink</b> in Colchester and Halifax counties may pose {{a serious threat to}} the captive mink and wild animal populations. Because treatment <b>of</b> infected free-ranging <b>mink</b> is not an option, AMDV control strategies for the captive mink should be primarily focused on bio-security to protect clean ranches...|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture <b>of</b> <b>mink</b> (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, Grant {{forged a}} working {{relationship}} with the director Alfred Hitchcock, appearing in films such as Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), To Catch a Thief (1955) and North by Northwest (1959). Hitchcock admired Grant and considered him {{to have been the}} only actor that he had ever loved working with. Towards the end of his film career, Grant was praised by critics as a romantic leading man, and received five Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nominations, including Indiscreet (1958) with Ingrid Bergman, That Touch <b>of</b> <b>Mink</b> (1962) with Doris Day, and Charade (1963) with Audrey Hepburn. He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal, as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, possessing the ability to play with his own dignity in comedies without sacrificing it entirely. His comic timing and delivery made Grant what Premiere magazine considers to have been [...] "quite simply, the funniest actor cinema has ever produced".|$|E
500|$|Black Francis {{recalled}} {{that he wrote}} [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] around {{the time he was}} age 14 or 15. Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] for its demo [...] "The Purple Tape". The group referred to it as [...] "the Tom Petty song", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, [...] "There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was something too straight about it." [...] When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release Come on Pilgrim, he intentionally left out [...] "Here Comes Your Man". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but [...] "it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't know what we were doing with [...] ". Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>Mink</b> DeVille's [...] "Spanish Stroll". For a post-Surfer Rosa single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose [...] "Gigantic", with [...] "River Euphrates" [...] on the B-side.|$|E

50|$|The American mink was {{introduced}} and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is {{less dependent on}} wetland habitats than the European mink and is 20-40% larger. The impact <b>of</b> feral American <b>minks</b> on European mink populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though the presence <b>of</b> the American <b>mink</b> has coincided with the decline <b>of</b> European <b>mink</b> numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline <b>of</b> the European <b>mink</b> in some areas preceded the introduction <b>of</b> the American <b>mink</b> by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though European mink populations in these regions are still declining.|$|R

During 1978, Rundgren undertook an American tour playing at smaller venues including The Bottom Line in New York and The Roxy in Los Angeles; this resulted in the double live album Back to the Bars, which featured a mixture of material from his solo work and Utopia, performed with backing musicians including Utopia, Edgar Winter, Spencer Davis, Daryl Hall and John Oates and Stevie Nicks.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet <b>of</b> the American <b>mink</b> (Neovison vison) in small {{artificial}} watercourses {{located in a}} farmland area of {{the valley of the}} River Barycz in Poland.

Minks also fed willingly on fish, birds and amphibians, whereas insects, crayfish and reptiles accounted for {{only a small part of}} the biomass of food consumed. The food niche breadth <b>of</b> the <b>mink’s</b> diet was wide, and varied significantly between seasons; in spring and autumn minks preyed mainly on rodents and fish, while the winter and summer diets consisted of a broad characterization of prey items. The proportion of mammals in the diet also decreased significantly during the summer months. These patterns differ from those previously reported in Europe, and demonstrate the plasticity <b>of</b> the <b>mink</b> diet across habitats...|$|R

But they were not there; and I took to watching instead a family <b>of</b> <b>mink</b> that lived in a den under a root, and a big owl that always slept in the same hemlock. Then, one day when a flock of partridges led me out of the wild berry bushes into a cool green island of the burned lands, I ran plump upon the deer and her fawns lying all together under a fallen treetop, dozing away the heat of the day.|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} splendid black bear-skins, {{two or three}} dozen martens, or sables, five or six black foxes, and a great many silver foxes, besides cross and red ones.

40|$|In the U. K. {{the impact}} <b>of</b> {{introduced}} American <b>mink</b> Mustela vison, on water voles Arvicola terrestris, may be exacerbated by habitat loss and fragmentation. Pristine wetlands in Belarus, which American mink invaded {{in the early}} 1990 s, provide a three-pronged opportunity to test this hypothesis. First, we examine the evidence that, even in the unmanaged wetlands of our Belarussian study site, American mink have reduced water vole populations. Second, we ask whether habitat size, type and isolation mitigate the impact <b>of</b> American <b>mink</b> predation. Thirdly, we explore whether water voles {{are at greater risk}} of predation from American than European <b>mink</b> because <b>of</b> their patterns of habitat use. Following the invasion <b>of</b> American <b>mink,</b> water voles were most abundant in small, still-water sites, far from river banks, while American mink were most active in large, running-water sites. Small mammal remains were found in a higher percentage of American than European <b>mink</b> scats, and <b>of</b> these, more were water vole in American mink scats. The occurrence of water voles in scats <b>of</b> both <b>mink</b> species declined after the American mink invaded and established. Our results provide at least circumstantial evidence that American mink limit water vole populations even in unmanaged wetland eco-systems, and that they have a greater impact than their European congener at least partly because they make greater use of isolated marshes, Although by no means providing complete protection, the configuration and dispersion of available habitat mitigated the impact <b>of</b> American <b>mink</b> on water voles. This raises the possibility that habitat restoration, especially through the establishment of isolated enclaves, could help reduce the effect <b>of</b> American <b>mink</b> in the U. K. These observations are of broader interest in the context of assessing the effect of multiple pressures on vulnerable species...|$|R
