5|$|Leo Kashida {{worked as}} an <b>outsourced</b> writer with Key on Tomoyo After, Little Busters! and Angel Beats. Chika Shirokiri, another <b>outsourced</b> writer who worked with Key on Little Busters!, also wrote the {{scenario}} for Kud Wafter. Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters!, and members of MintJam helped with arrangement. Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanons release, working {{as one of the}} signature composers, but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters!. Jun'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter. Two <b>outsourced</b> writers worked on the scenario for Rewrite and its fan disc Rewrite Harvest festa!: Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, and Romeo Tanaka. Rewrite and Harvest festa! also featured three <b>outsourced</b> musical composers: Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki. Mizutsuki later returned to compose music for Harmonia. At the time Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer, Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the scenario in Little Busters!. Tonokawa later contributed to the scenario in Rewrite and Harvest festa!, but resigned from Key in 2015. Itaru Hinoue, one of Key's founding members, was Key's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for six of Key's games. Hinoue resigned from Key in September 2016 after working on Harmonia.|$|E

Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|Many of Key's {{staff have}} left the brand over time, or have been {{employed}} as <b>outsourced</b> contributors. Naoki Hisaya had worked {{as one of the}} main scenario writers for Kanon, but once the project was complete, he left the brand. Another member of the staff that made Kanon was OdiakeS, an <b>outsourced</b> composer who has since helped Key with two music albums, one each released for Air and Clannad, but has done nothing with Key since 2004. Three staff members only worked with Key on Air: Takashi Ishikawa as one of the scenario writers, Kazuki Fujii as a scenario assistant, and Din as a background artist. Air and Clannad had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as scenario writers. Kai later headed the planning of Kud Wafter, as well as contributing on the scenario of Angel Beats, Harmonia and Summer Pockets. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle Mikipon, left after Clannad. Two other <b>outsourced</b> graphic artists, Minimo Tayama and Torino, have often contributed on Key's games. Scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between Air and Planetarian. Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for Planetarian, and another artist, Fumio, worked as the art director for Tomoyo After.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Software <b>outsourcing</b> {{has become}} a common method used in many IT {{companies}} to reduce development cost, increase development efficiency and concentrate limited resource on mainstream business and technology. One of the important software engineering problems under this background is how to form an <b>outsourcing</b> software development process, which sum up all the people, artifacts, methods, working flows in <b>outsourcing</b> development field to provide instructive process guidance. On the analysis {{of different kinds of}} software <b>outsourcing</b> patterns, this paper puts up a RUP based software <b>outsourcing</b> process framework, which include <b>outsourcing</b> patterns exiting in main stages in software life circle, such as requirement <b>outsourcing,</b> design <b>outsourcing,</b> implement <b>outsourcing,</b> testing <b>outsourcing</b> etc. Because of the particularity in the field of software <b>outsourcing,</b> RUP is not completely suit for the <b>outsourcing</b> software development, an extension and customization to RUP is necessary.

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the <b>outsourced</b> services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
5|$|The Bayan class {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the previous Russian armored cruisers, as they were smaller ships designed to serve as scouts for the fleet rather than as commerce raiders. Authorized in the 1896–1902 building program, the design was <b>outsourced</b> to a French shipyard, Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée, because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Negotiations began in March 1897, and a contract was signed in May 1898 for one ship with delivery in 36 months.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{development}} {{began in}} 2011. In {{order to create}} an accurate environment and be consistent with Tolkien's books, the developers consulted many people from Warner Brothers, as well as Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. They also received assistance from Weta Workshop, who advised on the special effects.

40|$|Purpose: The {{popularity}} and growth in <b>outsourcing</b> {{has resulted in}} many different <b>outsourcing</b> arrangements, from strategic and business process <b>outsourcing</b> to selective and tactical <b>outsourcing,</b> on a national or global scale. <b>Outsourcing</b> is frequently considered a vital ingredient to corporate restructuring and business improvement initiatives. However, it is often treated as a fixed discreet event such as a make or buy decision. As the rational and strategic implications of <b>outsourcing</b> vary, so too does the required <b>outsourcing</b> process and performance measures. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to review and synthesis available empirical literature on <b>outsourcing</b> frameworks and performance management techniques, and develop a framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance. Research Approach: A sample of empirical academic publications on <b>outsourcing</b> frameworks and performance measures, across various scholarly journals constitute the main data for analytical purposes. It is compiled from searches of the main academic databases. The studies in the sample are clustered according to their main research areas, with a narrative approach being used to review developments in each area. Following analysis of the reviewed literature, a number of the frameworks and their measures are adapted and integrated to develop a conceptual framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance. Findings and Originality: This conceptual based framework brings an integrated perspective to <b>outsourcing.</b> It develops a dynamic process of strategic alignment between environmental drivers, corporate <b>outsourcing</b> objectives, the <b>outsourcing</b> process and the performance measures. The proposed conceptual framework seeks to integrate the environmental and organisational <b>outsourcing</b> drivers down into the <b>outsourcing</b> process, culminating in a managed <b>outsourcing</b> relationship. Research Impact: For both the researcher and practioner, the measured <b>outsourcing</b> framework will provide a more holistic approach when considering and implementing <b>outsourcing.</b> Practical Impact: This paper is a first step towards developing a framework for measuring <b>outsourcing</b> performance, which practioners will be able to apply when considering, analysing and managing an <b>outsourcing</b> initiative...|$|R

5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was <b>outsourced</b> to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version takes place in Japan, the localized version {{is set in the}} United States: because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it.

ILM's initial cost estimates were over Paramount's budget, so to save money the filmmakers redesigned some shots and <b>outsourced</b> some to other companies.|$|E
5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be <b>outsourced</b> to a {{developer}} separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E

The unique age demography of Bangladesh, coupled with the low-cost work force and Government's Incentive for the IT service sector, makes Bangladesh a major player at the global service <b>outsourcing</b> market. Bangladesh is fast emerging as the next major global <b>outsourcing</b> destination.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{test the}} nine corollaries {{concerning}} the determinants of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship dimensions, strategic manoeuvres, clients’ and service providers’ evaluation regarding <b>outsourcing</b> category and <b>outsourcing</b> relationship types. The paper has the purpose of reviewing the concept of <b>outsourcing</b> in relation to FM, dealing with service providers’ performance {{and its effect on}} clients before providing a comprehensive discussion of <b>outsourcing.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual approach is adopted, suggesting that a study of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship between clients and service providers from these theoretical perspectives is used to develop corollaries about the relationships between the strategic manoeuvres identified and the different dimensions of <b>outsourcing</b> relationship. The corollaries are examined using non-parametric tests. Findings – The model of the facilities management (FM) <b>outsourcing</b> relationships presented in the paper shows performance of <b>outsourcing</b> services through evaluation of <b>outsourcing</b> categories on current and future FM contracts of clients and service providers. As a template of <b>outsourcing</b> relationships, the model is the context for predicting the important <b>outsourcing</b> categories to the future four FM <b>outsourcing</b> contracts, such as building maintenance, security, cleaning and catering. On prediction of those FM contracts, there is an inclination to the types of in-house and technical expertise on category of FM <b>outsourcing</b> relationship types from clients, whilst there is an equal inclination to the type of in-house <b>outsourcing</b> category from service providers. Originality/value – Management on <b>outsourcing</b> relationships between clients and service providers is now essential for effective <b>outsourcing</b> in FM. This paper provides an intriguing insight into how the effect of <b>outsourcing</b> relationships can be strategically implemented into the performance of service providers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEven {{though there}} is a big {{established}} IT <b>outsourcing</b> market, one can witness considerable amount of failed projects there. It is proven that good relationships between an <b>outsourcing</b> recipient and a provider contribute to the <b>outsourcing</b> success whereas less successful relationships increase the cost of <b>outsourcing.</b> The research in this area is mostly focused on either an <b>outsourcing</b> provider or more often on an <b>outsourcing</b> recipient, hardly considering both sides of the <b>outsourcing</b> relationships simultaneously. Moreover, there is no study on the importance of the determinants of the IT <b>outsourcing</b> relationships which takes into consideration both parties. In this research we are presenting the determinants of the IT <b>outsourcing</b> relationships. Moreover, we are evaluating the importance of the IT relationship determinants in the case study of the relationships between one <b>outsourcing</b> provider and one <b>outsourcing</b> recipient by using interviews as a data collection method and a content analysis as a data analysis method.

40|$|Almost all {{managers}} have {{directly or indirectly}} {{been involved in the}} practice of <b>outsourcing</b> in recent years. But as they know, <b>outsourcing</b> is not straightforward. <b>Outsourcing</b> inertia, when companies are slow to adapt to changing circumstances that accommodate higher <b>outsourcing</b> levels, may undermine a firm’s performance. This article investigates the presence of <b>outsourcing</b> inertia and the factors that help managers overcome it. Using statistical evidence, we show that positive performance effects related to <b>outsourcing</b> can accumulate when circumstances change. This is then followed by rapid increases in <b>outsourcing</b> levels (i. e. <b>outsourcing</b> processes). We investigate what gives rise to these <b>outsourcing</b> processes through follow-up interviews with sourcing executives, which suggest five drivers behind <b>outsourcing</b> processes: managerial initiative (using outside experience); hierarchy (foreign headquarters); imitation (of competitors and of similar firms); outsider advice (from external institutions); knowledge sources (using external information). These five drivers all offer scope for managerial action. We tie them to academic literatures and suggest ways of investigating their presence and impact on the <b>outsourcing</b> process. Overall, we conclude that while economizing factors {{play a key role in}} explaining how much firms <b>outsource,</b> it is socializing factors that tend to drive <b>outsourcing</b> processes...|$|R
