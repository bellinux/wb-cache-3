5|$|In 1662, {{the book}} La Logique ou l’Art de Penser was {{published}} anonymously in Paris. The authors presumably were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two leading Jansenists, who worked together with Blaise Pascal.

The Ars cogitandi consists of four books, with the fourth one dealing with decision-making under uncertainty by considering the analogy to gambling and introducing explicitly {{the concept of a}} quantified probability.|$|E

5|$|Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 – 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French {{physician}} and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become widely famous. He {{is best known}} for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since the publication <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> which has rarely been out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.|$|E
5|$|Some LGBT {{interpretations of}} popular stories and {{characters}} have been controversial. Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings, applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis {{and his love}} of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> and similar application of psychoanalysis {{to the study of}} Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.|$|E
5|$|The charismatic and {{sophisticated}} vampire of modern fiction {{was born in}} 1819 {{with the publication of}} The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend. The success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television shows.

5|$|When Martin {{was between}} Hollywood {{projects}} {{in the summer of}} 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called Avalon. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of A Game of Thrones. Putting Avalon aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that {{it was part of a}} longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series Doorways that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's next novel, The Man-Eater of Malgudi, was {{published}} in 1961. The book was reviewed as having a narrative that is a classical art form of comedy, with delicate control. After the launch <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> the restless Narayan once again took to travelling, and visited the U.S. and Australia. He spent three weeks in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne giving lectures on Indian literature. The trip was funded by a fellowship from the Australian Writers' Group. By this time Narayan had also achieved significant success, both literary and financial. He had a large house in Mysore, and wrote in a study with no fewer than eight windows; he drove a new Mercedes-Benz, a luxury in India at that time, to visit his daughter who had moved to Coimbatore after her marriage. With his success, both within India and abroad, Narayan started writing columns for magazines and newspapers including The Hindu and The Atlantic.|$|E
