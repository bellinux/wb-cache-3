Use of pheromone trap is one of the suitable methods for monitoring and controlling of the pest. In this work, three main factors which affect the efficiency of traps including trap type, pheromone dose and installation height trap were studied. Four types of trap including cylindrical, rectangular, delta and wing trap were tested. Capture efficiency of the traps, were installed in the middle, and top heights of the trees were compared. Three doses of pheromone 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 mgr per trap were also compared. Results showed that there were significant differences among four types of traps. Cylindrical, rectangular and delta traps caught more number of moths than wing trap (P&lt; 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences between}} two installation heights (P&gt; 0. 05). However, a significant differences was observed among three doses (P&lt; 0. 05), and the dose of 0. 5 mg caught more moths than the other three doses.

40|$|AbstractA Δ 11 desaturase {{from the}} oblique banded leaf <b>roller</b> <b>moth</b> Choristoneura rosaceana takes the {{saturated}} myristic acid and produces {{a mixture of}} (E) - 11 -tetradecenoate and (Z) - 11 -tetradecenoate with an excess of the Z isomer (35 : 65). A desaturase from the spotted fireworm moth Choristoneura parallela also operates on myristic acid substrate but produces almost pure (E) - 11 -tetradecenoate. The two desaturases share 92 % amino acid identity and 97 % amino acid similarity. There are 24 amino acids differing between these two desaturases. We constructed mutations at all of these positions to pinpoint the sites that determine the product stereochemistry. We demonstrated with a yeast functional assay that one amino acid at the cytosolic carboxyl terminus of the protein (258 E) is critical for the Z activity of the C.  rosaceana desaturase. Mutating the glutamic acid (E) into aspartic acid (D) transforms the C.  rosaceana enzyme into a desaturase with C.  parallela-like activity, whereas the reciprocal mutation of the C.  parallela desaturase transformed it into an enzyme producing an intermediate 64 : 36 E/Z product ratio. We discuss the causal link between this amino acid change and the stereochemical properties of the desaturase {{and the role of}} desaturase mutations in pheromone evolution...|$|R

40|$|Plant-insect {{interactions}} are a wide and diverse field of study. Abiotic and biotic factors influence the dynamic interaction between plants and their insect herbivores. Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth), Lymantria monacha (nun moth) and Tortrix viridana (green leaf <b>oak</b> <b>roller)</b> are important forest pest species. Not much {{is known about}} the extent of genetic diversity within and among these insect populations in comparison to the respective host trees. The main focus of this thesis is the genetic basis of adaptation of tree-feeding insect larvae in the genus Lymantria and Tortrix to their host trees. Gene expression at the mRNA level of insect larvae feeding on different tree species was analysed, and similarly gene expression in the host trees undergoing herbivory in the field was measured. Gene diversity at the genomic DNA level was assessed in a population genetic study of one Lymantria species. As part of an EU project (EVOLTREE - Evolution of Trees as Drivers of Terrestrial Biodiversity) patterns of adaptation were evaluated by using different molecular and ecological techniques. In general a diverse mixture of techniques and methodologies was used to generate new genetic information on plant-insect interactions. Digestive adaptations in the insects were identified from the herbivory laboratory studies and the host plant responses were identified in the field study. The cDNA-AFLP technique enabled the combination and challenge of field and laboratory experiments to be met and produced a detailed overview in respect of defense strategies {{on both sides of the}} interaction...|$|R

To optimise the permitted biological treatment, {{not only in terms}} of product amount but also for the time of application baseline susceptibility of T. viridiana from the Natural Reserve of Ficuzza (Palermo, Italy) to a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined for neonates and 2, 5, 10 and 15 day old larvae. The differences in susceptibility of the different larval development were recorded. For neonates the calculated DL 50 was 0. 63 μg/ml, while after five days it was 10. 01 μg/ml. The same doses had little effect on the older larvae, showing a clear decrease in susceptibility with age and larval growth. A relationship was also found between susceptibility and body length.

40|$|A {{review is}} given of recent {{pheromone}} work {{carried out in}} the Netherlands on Lepidoptera, cockroaches, pharaoh's ants and termites, special emphasis being given to isolation and identification aspects. The sex pheromones of three leaf <b>roller</b> <b>moths</b> (Tortricidae) have been isolated, identified and field tested, viz. those of Adoxophyes orana (cis- 9 -tetradecenyl acetate (tda) and cis-I 1 -tda in the ratio 9 : 1), Clepsis spectrana (cis- 9 -tda:cis- 11 -tda, 1 : 3) and Archipspodana (cis- 11 -tda:trans-l 1 -tda, about 1 : 1). For ?ponomeuta, data have been obtained indicating a correlation between taxonomic groups and pheromone structure. Two sex pheromones (periplanone A and B) of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, have been isolated and partially identified. Their elementary formulas, C. 15 H. 20 O. 2 and C. 15 H. 20 O. 3, respectively, suggest that they are sesquiterpenoids, spectral data of periplanone B indicating that it has the germacrane skeleton. The aggregation pheromone of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica appears to be a complex mixture in which certain free acids play an important role. Three heterocyclic compounds have been isolated from Pharaoh's ants, Monomorium pharaonis. Monomorine I, C. 13 H. 25 N, is the first indolizine derivative found in the animal kingdom. Monomorine II, C. 13 H. 27 N, and monomorine III, C. 15 H. 29 N, are pyrrolidine derivatives. The three compounds are constituents of the odour trail and are present in excretions collected from the insect's sting. These excretions have a function in trail-following as well as in defense. In choice tests monomorine I and III act as attractants. Cis- 3, cis- 6, trans- 8 -dodecatrienol, initially identified as a trail pheromone of the termite Reticulitermes virginicus, was found to be a trail pheromone also for Reticulitermes santonensis. Eight dodecatrienol isomers were tested for activity towards this termite. In their ability to evoke trail-following behaviour as well as their attractancy in choice tests, they resemble each other qualitatively, but quantitatively, they show considerable differences. From fungus-infected wood a compound was isolated which effectively induces trail-following behaviour, and moreover, is a potent attractant. Its elementary formula, C. 15 H. 24 O, and the presence of acorane among its hydrogenation products, show that it is a sesquiterpenoid. Two other potent attractants for R. santonensis were found in wood oils: tricycloekasantalal, C. 12 H. 13 O in East-Indian sandalwood oil and dihydroagarofuran, C. 15 H. 20 O in West-Indian sandalwood oil. © 1974 BRILL...|$|R
40|$|In Western Europe {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur L.) is the forest tree {{with the highest}} number of {{phytophagous}} insect species (Yela & Lawton 1997). One of these, the green <b>oak</b> leaf <b>roller</b> Tortrix viridana L. is an oligophagous herbivorous moth with a host range limited to the genus Quercus (Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999). During outbreaks, T. viridana often leads to defoliation of oaks in spring. The abundance of T. viridana is subject to the population size fluctuations typical for herbivorous insects, where periods of small population sizes (latent periods) alternate with periods of high population sizes (outbreak) (e. g. Schütte 1957, Horstmann 1984). Apart from many experimental studies on population dynamics of the moth (e. g. Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999, Ivashov & al. 2002) so far little {{attention has been paid to}} the genetic variation within the species as an important aspect of the genetics of this host-parasite interaction. Simchuk & al. (1999) found changes in the heterozygosity level of different isozyme loci during outbreaks in T. viridana and molecular markers for T. viridana have been developed for analyses of genetic variation within and among populations (Schroeder & Scholz 2005). But, investigations of genetic variation within and among populations of forest pest species are important to predict future pest outbreaks. So far the processes outbreaks based on are not entirely clarified, however it is known that migration plays a major role. Using molecular markers investigations of the genetic variation are possible and offer the opportunity to analyse distribution events. In this paper first results are presented concerning the genetic variation of the green <b>oak</b> leaf <b>roller</b> at three geographic scales: (1) among trees within a population, (2) among populations at a small spatial scale of about 150 km and (3) among populations at a broader geographic scale up to 3000 km. Furthermore results of the genetic variation of oaks at the small spatial scale are represented. Populationen des grünen Eichenwicklers (Tortrix viridana L., Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) und der Stieleiche (Quercus robur L., Fagaceae) wurden auf genetische Differenzierungen mit Hilfe von Kern-DNA-Markern untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 14 Eichenbestände in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) und 7 weitere in verschiedenen Regionen Europas in die Untersuchung einbezogen. Weder für die Eiche noch für den Eichenwickler sind genetische Differenzierungen der Populationen auf einer kleinen geographischen Skala (etwa 150 km) nachweisbar, jedoch zeigen die Eichenpopulationen eine zunehmende genetische Distanz mit zunehmender geographischer Distanz. Für den Eichenwickler konnten innerhalb von Populationen in einem Radius von etwa 40 m Familienstrukturen ermittelt werden und auf einer kontinentalen Skala lassen sich die Ergebnisse für den Eichenwickler mit einer „isolation by distance“ erklären...|$|R
40|$|The green <b>oak</b> leaf <b>roller,</b> Tortrix viridana L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pests, causing damages to various species of oak, feeding on different host plants including Quercus infectoria Oliv, Q. branti Lindl, and Q. libani Oliv. Nutritional indices, activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds of T. viridana were studied under laboratory conditions. In addition, chemical components were analysed in the leaves of the three host plants. Fourth instar larvae reared on Q. branti showed the highest values of relative consumption rate (RCR), approximate digestibility, and consumption index (48. 73 ± 6. 22; 90. 45 ± 1. 06 and 97. 45 ± 12. 44 respectively), while the lowest values were observed on Q. libani. Efficiency of conversion of ingested food in the fourth instar larvae was the highest (3. 17 ± 0. 661) on Q. libani and the lowest (1. 53 ± 0. 164) on Q. branti. The fifth instar larvae fed on Q. libani had the highest RCR (15. 64 ± 2. 51). The highest amounts of triglycerides, uric acid, glucose, protein and the lowest activity of alkaline phosphatase were observed in the fifth instar larvae reared on Q. libani.

40|$|The Green <b>oak</b> leaf <b>roller</b> Tortrix viridana {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful pest of the Palearctic oaks. The young larvae of T. viridana develop inside the {{flushing}} buds and their egg hatch is synchronized with the bud burst of the oaks. The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic structure and variation of mitochondrial and nuclear loci in Sardinian populations associated with deciduous (Quercus pubescens) and evergreen (Q. suber and Q. ilex) oaks. We performed multilocus analyses (COI, COII mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellites) in about two hundreds individuals collected on all the three oak species coming from the most important forest districts in Sardinia Island, Italy. The populations were also characterized by egg hatching, after comparison in semi-field tests for egg development. Eighty-five mitochondrial haplotypes were found, with three ones shared among all populations, except the most southern one. A high haplotype diversity (H = 0. 90) and a low nucleotide diversity (? = 0. 003) have been observed. Microsatellites were highly variable with alleles ranging from 4 to 56 for locus and polymorfic information content values varying from 0. 510 to 0. 945. AMOVA tests were performed by structuring samples in different groups (geographic districts/oak species/egg development). The highest values of Fixation indexes resulted grouping populations according to early or late egg hatching. Furthermore, we tested for sex-biased dispersal, estimating pairwise FST, FIS, and relatedness r at nuclear loci separately for the sexes. We produced evidence for non random patterns of gene flow probably mediated by male biased dispersal, with values significantly higher in females than in males and females the phylopatric sex. In support of a male biased dispersal, nuclear and mitochondrial markers provided different results in the matter of genetic structure, with mitochondrial loci, unlike microsatellites, highlighting significant differentiation levels among populations...|$|R
