During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation.

5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve {{the way in which}} the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{political}} environment was tense across Europe, with terrorist attacks and riots {{in even the}} most developed countries, the situation was more critical in Portugal, with economic and financial havoc. This was a time of upheavals, locally and nationally. The old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic; factions quickly developed between groups within the party and formed new organizations. There was a succession of general strikes (now legal), demonstrations, gunfire exchanges, and even bombings in the streets of Lisbon; the Republican political class was divided <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the situation. In 1912 the monarchists exploited discontent with liberal laws imposed by the Republicans in the north, and launched a coup that failed.
