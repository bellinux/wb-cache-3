5|$|Ganymede {{participates in}} orbital {{resonances}} with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions {{change with the}} same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} asexual means of reproduction. Budding can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> new {{individuals}} are formed from pieces that divide {{off from the}} pedal disc. Fragmentation can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the individual moves slowly over the substrate and leaves small pieces of itself behind which eventually grow into new individuals. Division or fission can also <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the corallimorph divides down the centre to form two new individuals.|$|R
5|$|Shared gaze <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> two {{individuals}} are simply {{looking at an}} object. Shared gaze is {{the lowest level of}} joint attention.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
50|$|The {{velocity}} maxima and minima do {{not necessarily}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the crank makes a right angle with the rod.Counter-examples exist to disprove the idea that velocity maxima/minima <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> crank-rod angle is right angled.|$|R
50|$|Under {{excess load}} conditions, {{the system can}} be {{designed}} to fail gracefully rather than all at once. Brownouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the supply power drops below the demand. Blackouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the supply fails completely.|$|R
50|$|Subtle {{expressions}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a person’s {{emotional response}} to a situation, to another person or to the environment around them is of low intensity. They also <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a person is just starting to feel an emotion.|$|R
5|$|An annular eclipse <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the Sun and Moon {{are exactly}} {{in line with}} the Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
50|$|Automation bias {{can take}} the form of {{omission}} errors, which <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems, or commission errors, which <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information.|$|R
50|$|Dies must be {{properly}} aligned in presses for coins {{to be struck}} correctly. Errors <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> dies are offset, tilted, or rotated. Offset errors <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the hammer die is not centered over the anvil die typically resulting in an off-centered obverse, but centered reverse. Tilting errors <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> die surfaces are not parallel producing coins that are thinner along one edge, and sometimes causing missing design elements along the opposite edge because of insufficient pressure being exerted on that edge. Rotation errors <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the images on the obverse and reverse dies are turned from the normal positions such as when the reverse image is at a right angle to the obverse.|$|R

5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> adjacent sub-units of {{a cluster}} {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through displacement of a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the process begins with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is essentially sequential displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E
5|$|Dropped-ball: <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> {{the referee}} has stopped play {{for any other}} reason, such as a serious injury to a player, {{interference}} by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} market {{withdrawals}} and medical device safety alerts'. Market withdrawals <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a product has a minor violation {{that does not}} require FDA legal action. Medical device safety alerts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> there are unreasonable safety risks associated with using a product.|$|R

5|$|Equilibrium <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the {{resultant}} force {{acting on a}} point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes such as lithium-6, {{as well as}} some {{beryllium}} and boron {{are generated}} in space through cosmic ray spallation. This <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.|$|E
5|$|Language endangerment <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> a {{language}} {{is at risk}} of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Comparison of {{minimum and}} maximum {{apparent}} sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets).

30|$|Accidents {{frequently}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> {{the weather}} is clear.|$|R
50|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} {{disorders are}} one cause of metabolic disorders, and <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a defective gene causes an enzyme deficiency. These diseases, {{of which there}} are many subtypes, are known as inborn errors of metabolism. Metabolic diseases can also <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the liver or pancreas do not function properly.|$|R
5|$|Overdifferentiation is when phonemic distinctions from one's primary {{language}} are {{imposed on the}} sounds of the second system where they are not required; underdifferentiation of phonemes <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> two sounds of the second system are not maintained because they are not present in the primary system.|$|E
5|$|Release <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> the new viruses escape or are {{released}} from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called lysis. Other viruses such as HIV {{are released}} more gently by a process called budding.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.|$|E
50|$|In Slavic, Baltic, and Hungarian folklore, it is {{said that}} hiccups <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the person {{experiencing}} them is being talked about by someone not present. In Indian, Nepalese, and Arabic folklore, they are similarly said to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the person experiencing them is being thought of by somebody close.|$|R
30|$|Complete {{failures}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> {{the developers}} {{are unable to}} identify any design problem with Organic and do not try again. Partial failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the developer gives up from using Organic’s functionalities before identifying any design problem and tries to achieve this in another way. Finally, temporary failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> the developer temporarily interrupts the identification of design problems with Organic due to some communicability issue. According to the CEM, there are three types of temporary failures: (1) trying to communicate, (2) trying to fix an error, and (3) {{trying to understand the}} rules.|$|R
5000|$|The Majority of sprained ankles in volleyball <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> {{a player}} {{is at the}} net, either {{blocking}} or Spiking. [...] The reason why ankle sprains occur at the net is because both blocking and spiking involve jumping and possibly of landing on an opponents foot causing the injury. Approximately 50 percent of all sprained ankles in volleyball <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a blocker lands on the attacking players foot, while about 25 percent <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> a blocker lands on their own teammates foot following a block with multiple blockers involved.|$|R
