Our empirical results show that GDP growth is inversely related to non-performing loans, suggesting that an improvement in the real economy translates into lower non-performing loans. We also find that banks which charge relatively higher interest rates and lend excessively are likely to incur higher levels of non-performing loans.

Hence, any factors hindering the seizure of the collateral or lowering its value, such as inefficient legal systems, moratoria on foreclosures or bottlenecks in judicial procedures may significantly increase losses facing banks.

First, different satellite panel econometric models for corporate and retail loans were used to estimate loan growth and non-performing loans.

50|$|In modern credit-based economies, {{deflation}} may {{be caused}} by the central bank initiating higher interest rates (i.e., to 'control' inflation), thereby possibly popping an asset bubble. In a credit-based economy, a slow-down or fall in lending leads to less money in circulation, with a further sharp fall in money supply as confidence reduces and velocity weakens, with a consequent sharp fall-off in demand for employment or goods. The fall in demand causes a fall in prices as a supply glut develops. This becomes a deflationary spiral when prices fall below the costs of financing production, or repaying debt levels incurred at the prior price level. Businesses, unable to make enough profit no matter how low they set prices, are then liquidated. Banks get assets which have fallen dramatically in value since their mortgage loan was made, and if they sell those assets, they further glut supply, which only exacerbates the situation. To slow or halt the deflationary spiral, banks will often withhold collecting <b>on</b> <b>non-performing</b> loans (as in Japan, and most recently America and Spain). This is often no more than a stop-gap measure, because they must then restrict credit, since they do not have money to lend, which further reduces demand, and so on.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper compares four {{forms of}} inter-regional {{financial}} risk shar-ing: (i) segmentation, (ii) integration trough the secured interbank market, (ii) integration trough the unsecured interbank market, (iv) integration of retail mar-kets. The secured interbank market is an optimal risk-sharing device when banks report liquidity needs truthfully. It allows diversification without {{the risk of}} cross-regional financial contagion. However, free-riding on the liquidity provision in this market restrains the achievable risk-sharing {{as the number of}} integrated regions in-creases. In too large an area this moral hazard problem becomes so severe that either unsecured interbank lending or, ultimately, the penetration of retail markets is preferable. Even though this deeper financial integration entails the risk of con-tagion it may be beneficial for large economic areas, because it can implement an efficient sharing of idiosyncratic regional shocks. Therefore, the enlargement of a monetary union, for example, extending the common interbank market might in-crease the benefits of also integrating retail banking markets through cross-border transactions or bank mergers. We discuss these results {{in the context of the}} on-going debate on European financial integration and the removal of bank branching restrictions in the United States happening primarily during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, and we derive implications for the relationship between financial integration and financial stability.
