A stagecoach made frequent stops at roadside coaching inns for water, food and horses. A passenger train stops only at designated {{stations in the}} city centre, around which were built grand <b>railway</b> hotels. <b>Motorcar</b> traffic on old-style two-lane highways may pause at any camp, cabin court or motel along the way, while freeway traffic is restricted to access from designated off-ramps to side roads which quickly become crowded with hotel chain operators.|$|R

The journey at that time involved walking for two days, riding a vintage lorry and then a steam locomotive to the Indian border at Raxaul, followed by taking the Indian <b>railway</b> and a <b>motorcar</b> to Sikkim. From Sikkim, the merchants traveled by mule carvan to Lhasa which took 20 days. This trade route is an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road.|$|R
25|$|The {{border between}} East and West Berlin was also {{significantly}} tightened, {{although it was}} not fully closed at this stage. By the end of September 1952, about 200 of the 277 streets which ran from the Western sectors to the East were closed to traffic and the remainder were subjected to constant police <b>observation.</b> <b>Railway</b> traffic was routed around the Western sectors and all employees of nationalised factories had to pledge not to visit West Berlin on pain of dismissal. However, even with these restrictions the border in Berlin remained considerably easier to cross than the main inner German border; consequently, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West. The outflow of people remained considerable despite the new restrictions. Between 1949and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, an estimated 3.5million East Germans– a sixth of East Germany's entire population– emigrated to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising and the shortages caused by the introduction of collectivisation resulted in major increases in refugee numbers. In August 1961, the Berlin Wall was built, finally putting an end to the stream of refugees. With the erection of the Wall, Berlin quickly went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.|$|R

40|$|Decisions {{are seen}} from a phenomenological lens {{focusing}} on their characteristic temporal and flexible structure of meaning. In a bureaucratic social setting emphasizing procedural rules, legal constraints and formal rationality the temporality of decisions can prove to be problematic. The physical planning of transport systems infrastructure projects is characterized by high level of social, material, technical and regulatory complexity. Drawing on ethnographic <b>observations</b> of <b>railway</b> planning meetings this case study explores how decision processes over time are shaped by the inter-dependency of planning actors, their co-ordination of action and adaptive expectations. The paper contributes {{to the understanding of}} the interrelatedness of decision processes in organizational contexts, following a “messy” logic of practical and material considerations, negotiations of what is to be considered to be of value, and not the least, post-hoc rationalizations...|$|R
30|$|Our {{estimates}} (REBUS) {{are generally}} {{higher than the}} estimates from HEATCO and higher for road-traffic noise compared to [19]. Note that [19] finds a higher WTP to reduce railway noise than road noise. A suggested explanation for their results is too few <b>observations</b> for <b>railway</b> noise ([44], p. 334). A direct comparison between REBUS and ASEK is only relevant for road noise {{since there is no}} corresponding ASEK value for railway noise. Therefore, since the ASEK values include the health component we compare these values to the REBUS values also including the health component. These REBUS values indicate that the social cost of noise is underestimated at low levels with the current values, and substantially overestimated at higher levels. The strongly progressive relation in ASEK is not found in either HEATCO or in [19]. 17 The relation between cost and noise level for railways in REBUS is similar to that in ASEK.|$|R

Also, because rail station building quality and safety are enforced by the European Union, this paper brings into attention a lot of <b>observations</b> on Romanian <b>railway</b> buildings architecture. Unfortunately, in Romania there are no equivalent high-speed tracks, the rail network is partly electrified, with no flagship technology. In fact, new national upgraded lines do not employ 20 th century engineering. With no elimination of constrictions such as at-grade crossings, no upgraded buildings and with no range of quality services for passengers, Romanian railway accumulates deficiencies over a period longer than twenty years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{significant}} parameters in design as well as fatigue assessment of railway bridges is the dynamic factor. The dynamic factor, also called dynamic amplification factor (DAF), must {{be applied to the}} static load model in order to take account of dynamic magnification of stresses and vibration effects in the bridge. The dynamic factor which actually enhances the static load effects depends on many parameters that are difficult to take into account with reasonable accuracy. The maximum bridge-span, train speed, self-weight, expansion joints if any is placed in bridge, the type of bridge supports and finally soil–structure interaction are among these parameters. This paper studies the variations of the analytical and experimental <b>observations</b> on steel <b>railway</b> bridge dynamics. For this purpose the measured stresses due to passing a locomotive through a historical steel railway bridge in Germany are compared with the calculated stresses contemplating the dynamic factor proposed by EN 1991 - 2 [1] applied to the static load model of the same locomotive...|$|R
40|$|In road {{engineering}} research and design {{the principles of}} material mechanics have not yet become a standard tool. In this contribution a project aimed at applying these principles to asphalt concrete is presented. Attention is paid to {{the differences between the}} standard test procedures and those based on mechanics considerations, presenting examples of the disturbances that can occur to illustrate the need for mechanically sound testing. The general approach in the ACRe project is introduced, showing the material model utilised and the parameters that have to be determined. The physical meaning of the model parameters is mentioned the tests used for the model parameter determination, uniaxial tension and compression tests and four-point shear tests, are introduced. The uniaxial compression test is discussed in more detail, to illustrate the approach used in the test programme. The results from this test are also presented, as well as the way in which a general expression for the compressive strength of the material was determined {{on the basis of these}} results. Finally, an example of the application of the model for damage predictions in {{road engineering}} constructions is presented. In this example two different pavement structures are analysed, illustrating that this kind of analyses can show the different damage patterns that will occur. In current day road engineering design approaches for every structure the same location is considered normative. From observations in practise it is known that this is not the case and the differences observed in the simulations agree rather well with these <b>observations.</b> Road & <b>Railway</b> Research LaboratoryCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{dependency on}} private motor vehicles has brought massive traffic congestion and thus, signalized notable demand for {{effective and efficient}} public transportation. Rail transit system in Malaysia, particularly in Johor is required in-line with the increasing concern for global environmental and climate change issues towards socio-economic development and population growth in Johor. This study is conducted to investigate the demand for rail transportation system which is proposed to link Batu Pahat, Kluang and Mersing districts which are expected to experience rapid growth in the near future. It is also conducted because currently, there is a remarkable socioeconomic development, traffic growth and fast urban growth in the selected study area. However, {{it was found that}} there is no plan to establish a sustainable transportation system specially a rail transportation system and this study is carried out to fill up this,' gap. The research methodology for this study is by several method of data collection using traffic impact assessment, public survey, site <b>observation,</b> interviews with <b>railway</b> industries and local authority. This is to investigate the current environmental status, socio-economic and existing traffic condition of Batu Pahat, Kluang, Mersing districts. It determines the needs to possibly link Batu Pahat, Kluang and Mersing using a rail network, with the evaluation of the viable railway line alignment and its projected impacts. From the study, it was found that approximately more than 60 % of the response showed that rail transportation is demanded along the study area. Traffic projections indicated that about 3 % of the year traffic growth and latest demographic statistics forecasted growth of about 2 % (Batu Pahat), 1 % (Kluang), and 0. 1 % (Mersing) yearly population growth. In conclusion it was found that if the railway route line proposed is viable and has a potential as future public transportation especially to connect Batu Pahat, Kluang and Mersing towns, implementing this Johor East-West rail network project will be able to heighten the environmental performance, socio-economic growth and the mobility of the townships population concerned...|$|R
