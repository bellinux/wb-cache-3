5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear <b>of</b> <b>never</b> being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart {{a chance to}} make a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration <b>of</b> <b>never</b> being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration fell back on the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers. The security of the regime depended on an armed force <b>of</b> <b>never</b> less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped {{from as far away as}} Aberdeen, had cost £50,000 in 1655, when it was still unfinished. Inverlocky had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E

5|$|In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} the 1967 film Casino Royale from Sony Pictures Entertainment for $10million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the Thunderball novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on Thunderball and had licensed his rights for the production <b>of</b> <b>Never</b> Say Never Again in 1983. In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} <b>of</b> <b>never</b> missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness {{that makes it difficult}} to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool they need for their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories <b>of</b> <b>never</b> being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, {{with an adult}} male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances <b>of</b> <b>never</b> finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, {{writer and}} planner Kotaro Uchikoshi, character designer Yuu Takigawa, and composer Takeshi Abo. Because the science fiction aspects <b>of</b> <b>Never</b> 7 had been positively received, Ever 17 {{was made with}} a larger focus on science fiction. A remake, simply titled Ever 17, was developed by 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011, with the original's 2D sprites replaced by 3D models; this change was done as 3D models were seen as being easier to animate. The game has been positively received, with reviewers calling {{it one of the}} best in its genre, citing its story, characters, music, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property <b>of</b> <b>never</b> changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E

5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price <b>of</b> <b>never</b> seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to hear from him that it was probably for the better.|$|E
5|$|At the OVW tapings on May 10, Kennedy {{returned}} to in-ring action facing the Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, in a title match that Kennedy {{was unable to}} win. Kennedy made his return to SmackDown! on the June 9 episode with a victory over Scotty 2 Hotty after using the Kenton Bomb. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, Matt Hardy used a roll-up to defeat Kennedy, ending Kennedy's streak <b>of</b> <b>never</b> being defeated by pin or submission. On the July 21 episode of SmackDown!, Batista put out an open challenge to find an opponent for The Great American Bash, as his original opponent, Mark Henry, had been injured. Kennedy accepted the challenge and won the match by disqualification, however, he suffered a severe injury during the match after being thrown headfirst into the steel steps, resulting in an exposed cranium laceration which required twenty stitches to close. He then entered into a short feud with Batista, defeating him by countout in their second match, but losing via pinfall in the third. Kennedy helped The McMahons (Vince and Shane) in their feud with D-Generation X (DX), appearing at both SummerSlam and the August 28 episode of Raw to attack DX.|$|E
