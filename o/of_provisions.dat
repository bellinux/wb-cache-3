5|$|Commandant Chaltin {{recovered}} three cannons, {{over seven}} hundred rifles, and a considerable supply <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> from the Mahdist post at Rejaf. Three thousand Congolese regulars were garrisoned at the town, and a gunboat {{was brought up}} the Nile to defend its ports. After securing Rejaf, Chaltin and his column marched to the northernmost point of the Lado Enclave {{in order to establish}} a Belgian presence in the area and prevent Mahdist reentry. A serious assault on the post at Rejaf occurred in June 1898, when Mahdists forced their way through Free State defenses before being finally defeated near the town.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E

5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold and the lack <b>of</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported Athens, {{and he was able to}} put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E

5|$|Sverdrup's {{main task}} now {{was to keep}} his crew busy. He ordered a {{thorough}} spring cleaning, and set a party to chip {{away some of the}} surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there was no immediate danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of sledges, and the organisation <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet above the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E

5|$|Before the battle, Captain Charles Elliot, {{the chief}} {{superintendent}} of British trade in China, sailed to Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied by the}} schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. Upon encountering three Chinese junks, Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to re-allow the supply <b>of</b> <b>provisions.</b> After several hours of unsuccessful correspondence, Elliot delivered an ultimatum that if provisions were not received, the junks would be sunk. When it expired with no results, the British opened fire on the junks, which returned fire {{with support from the}} fort on shore. During the engagement, the larger junks pursued the British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition. But after replenishing their cartridges, the British re-engaged the ships, which retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E
5|$|Having {{exhausted}} {{most of his}} {{resources in}} Pennsylvania helping establish the new United States government, Captain Rowan decided to move the family to the western frontier, where he hoped to start fresh and rebuild his fortune. On October 10, 1783, the Rowans and five other families embarked on a flat bottomed boat near Redstone Creek and began their journey down the Monongahela River toward the Falls of the Ohio. The travelers expected the journey to last a few days at most, but ice along the river slowed the journey, and a lack <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> exacerbated the delays. Three of the families disembarked near what is now Maysville, Kentucky; the Rowans would later learn {{that most of these}} settlers were killed by Indians. The remaining settlers continued downriver, reaching Louisville, Kentucky on March 10, 1783.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, British {{relations}} with the Cherokee, which had been moderately friendly for several decades, grew sour after several Cherokee chiefs were imprisoned and killed in South Carolina. In early 1760, the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun, a remote outpost {{in what is now}} Tennessee. The garrison held out until August of that year, but was forced to surrender due to lack <b>of</b> <b>provisions.</b> A relief column under Archibald Montgomerie failed to reach the fort after burning the Cherokee Lower Towns and being stopped at the Battle of Echoee. In spite of the garrison leaving the fort under a flag of truce, the Cherokee killed 22 of its members on their march home in retaliation for the colonists' earlier killing of 22 Cherokee held as prisoners at Fort Prince George (South Carolina).|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is to {{demonstrate}} that the concept <b>of</b> location <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> investment services and performance of investment advice is a fundamental element of the MiFID framework which has not deserved expected attention of the European legislators. The study demonstrates the importance of this notion for both investment firms and for national supervisors. It analysis of the evolution of the concept and addresses problems that are likely to arise in the light of recent legislative developments - the adoption of MiFID II and MiFIR that recognise the application of the principle of solicitation in the context of defining the location <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> services by third country firms. The thesis analysis the interplay between the notion <b>of</b> location <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> services and principle of solicitation, it further examines those concepts in the light <b>of</b> other relevant <b>provisions</b> and definitions embedded in the MiFID framework and analysis problems that may occur as a lack of coherence between European legislative instruments in general. The study is supplemented with an example of problems experienced by the national legislators in Estonia when implementing the concept <b>of</b> location <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> services. The research concludes that Europe is lacking guidance in this matter and considering that the Member States are soon to face the challenge of implementing the revised MiFID suggests that it is the foremost time for providing clarity. The thesis makes suggestions for providing a coherent approach {{to the understanding of the}} concept <b>of</b> location <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> services and application of the solicitation principle...|$|R
