According to The Black Scholar journal, [...] "depending <b>on</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> listen to...

For many in Southern Africa, he remained one of the [...] "grand old men" [...] of the African liberation movement.|$|E

[...] Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: [...] "Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character.

Turner and fellow quarterback Jordan Steffy, a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate Senator John McCain, were the most frequent debaters, while defensive tackle Dean Muhtadi was described as the primary instigator. During the summer of 2009, Turner held an internship on Capitol Hill working for Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader and Maryland's fifth district congressman. Turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, which he said probably annoyed his conservative father, John Turner.

David Ownby, a {{professor}} of history at of the University of Montreal and expert on Falun Gong, wrote in Falun Gong and the Future of China that Falun Gong practitioners were probable candidates for organ harvesting in Chinese prisons. However, he felt that Falun Gong spokespersons [...] "overplayed their hand" [...] with the concentration camp allegations, potentially losing credibility in the eyes of neutral observers, despite the real persecution they were suffering. A Congressional Research Service report by Thomas Lum said that the report relies on logical inferences and telephone call transcripts which, he suggested, may not be credible. Glen McGregor of the Ottawa Citizen was skeptical about the logistical plausibility of the allegations after visiting Sujiatun at the invitation of the Chinese Medical Association.
