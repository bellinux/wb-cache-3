With help from a prototype Arc Reactor and stolen Vibranium, the Cabal builds a Static Expander which traps the Avengers and will scatter them across time and space. This causes Black Panther to call the reserve members to help fight them. When Leader is defeated, he tells the other Cabal members to help him where they don't take action.

5000|$|When Fox's {{government}} fell {{one year}} later, Stafford {{had the opportunity}} to become Premier again, but declined. His stated reason for doing so was his hostility to Governor George Grey, who Stafford believed he would be unable to <b>override</b> <b>on</b> policy matters - Stafford did not wish to become Premier if the Governor would simply block his policies. Instead, Alfred Domett took the premiership. Domett's premiership has been described as [...] "like a Stafford ministry without Stafford". Domett was replaced by Frederick Whitaker after little more than a year, but Whitaker himself only lasted a similar time before being replaced by Frederick Weld. Weld, like Domett, followed policies similar to Stafford, although did not enjoy good personal relations with him.|$|E

Attorney Robert Nelson, representing Jacquelyn Donoghue of Holder, Nebraska, the 67-year-old widow of a man killed in an accident in which her model year 2006 Prius allegedly suddenly accelerated into another vehicle, killing the man and seriously injuring her, alleged that Toyotas failure to include a brake <b>override</b> <b>on</b> their models played a [...] "direct role" [...] {{in the death of}} John Donoghue. Edgar Heiskell, an attorney involved with one of the lawsuits, contends that electromagnetic interference with the electronic throttle control system is to blame for acceleration cases.

Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, Smash, frontman Dexter Holland wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz decided to sell Smash to a major label in [...] "return for a royalty <b>override</b> <b>on</b> it," [...] an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as Geffen, Capitol and Sony, in attempt to sign The Offspring. The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they [...] "took less money" [...] with the label and the signing [...] "was not {{to try and make}} more money." [...] Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not [...] "record for someone who thinks Gurewitz can force them to" [...] and would not [...] "record for a guy who's worse than a major label."

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper {{published}} by the APSR, Carrubba, Gabel, and Hankla claim that the decisionmaking of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has been constrained – systematically – {{by the threat of}} <b>override</b> <b>on</b> the part of Member States, acting collectively, and the threat of noncompliance on the part of any single Member State government. They further purport to have found strong evidence in favor of Intergovernmentalist, but not Neofunctionalist, integration theory. Both claims conflict with prior, serious empirical research on these issues. In this paper, we reject their claims {{on the basis of the}} same data. We show that the threat of override is not credible, and that the legal system is activated, rather than paralyzed, by Member State noncompliance. In the small number of important cases in which the Member States formally sought to curb the Court and constrain future developments, they failed miserably. Moreover, in a head to head showdown between the Commission (and Neofunctionalism), on the one hand, and the Member States (and Intergovernmentalism) on the other hand, the Commission wins in a landslide. The data also provide evidence in support of a theory of the ECJ’s “majoritarian activism”: when Member States encourage the Court to “punish” defendant Member States for non-compliance, the ECJ tends to do so. In such cases, the Member States work to enable the Court, not to “constrain” it...|$|E
40|$|In {{an article}} {{previously}} {{published by the}} APSR, Carrubba, Gabel, and Hankla claim that the deci-sion making of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has been constrained—systematically—by thethreat of <b>override</b> <b>on</b> the part of member state governments, acting collectively, and {{by the threat of}} noncompliance on the part of any single state. They also purport to have found strong evidence in favor of intergovernmentalist, but not neofunctionalist, integration theory. On the basis of analysis of the same data, we demonstrate that the threat of override is not credible and that the legal system is activated, rather than paralyzed, by noncompliance. Moreover, when member state governments did move to nullify the effects of controversial ECJ rulings, they failed to constrain the court, which continued down paths cleared by the prior rulings. Finally, in a head-to-head showdown between intergovernmentalism and neofunctionalism, the latter wins in a landslide. In “Judicial Behavior under Political Constraints:Evidence from the European Court of Justice,”Carrubba, Gabel, and Hankla (CGH; 2008) make two startling claims. First, after examining the impact of member state government (MSG) briefs on the rul-ings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 3, 176 legal questions over an 11 -year period (January 1987 – December 1997), the authors declare that its decision making has been constrained by the threat of overrid...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{abundant}} human {{and natural resources}} located at rural areas, {{it is expected that}} rural dwellers will be awashed with continuous affluence. On the contrary, rural areas are deprived of the benefits of resources located within the area. Rural areas have continued to be subjected to all forms of deprivation and thus live in abject and excruciating poverty {{at the expense of the}} urban areas. This work attempted to examine the increasing or widening gulf of inequality and trace, over time, how the state has continued to roll out policies and strategies that have deprived rural areas of the basic needs of life at the expense of urban growth and consolidation. Thus, within the framework of the emergence and consolidation of the State of Zazzau, rural Zaria and its economy became subsumed into the survival operations of the city. This was facilitated through intense extraction of surplus and other forms of appropriations along with economic and political subordination leading to the further urban-rural gap. Lack of access to politically participate in and exert influence on decision making, quality education, health care services and other forms of deprivations that subjected rural communities of Zaria to intense poverty provoke them, more than anything else, to politically unite against their city counterparts and overlords. The point of departure of the study suggests that for prosperity to <b>override</b> <b>on</b> poverty, rural folks must be strategically strengthened, organized and turned out be politically proactive with enhanced services...|$|E
40|$|The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) is a {{suborbital}} surveying experiment {{designed to}} study the evolutionary history and processes of star formation in local galaxies (including the Milky Way) and galaxies at cosmological distances. The BLAST continuum camera, which consists of 270 detectors distributed between three arrays, observes simultaneously in broadband (30 %) spectral windows at 250, 350, and 500 microns. The optical design {{is based on a}} 2 m diameter telescope, providing a diffraction-limited resolution of 30 ' at 250 microns. The gondola pointing system enables raster mapping of arbitrary geometry, with a repeatable positional accuracy of 30 '; postflight pointing reconstruction to < 5 ' rms is achieved. The onboard telescope control software permits autonomous execution of a preselected set of maps, with the option of manual <b>override.</b> <b>On</b> this poster, we describe the primary characteristics and measured in-flight performance of BLAST.
