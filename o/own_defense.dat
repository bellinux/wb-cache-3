Among fans who interacted with Nicieza in a forum discussion, some responses were also negative, prompting responses from Nicieza in his <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He {{asked the}} court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to {{determine}} the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.|$|E

5|$|When Romero's {{committee}} intensifies its investigation, Underwood {{tries to}} divert their attention by ordering troops into Syria on {{the pretense of}} preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E

In addition, many modern {{warships}} operate independently of carrier-based air protection {{and they must}} provide their <b>own</b> <b>defenses</b> against missiles and aircraft. Under these circumstances, the ships themselves must utilize multilayered defenses which have been built into them.|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b>|$|R
25|$|After its {{disastrous}} {{defeat at}} the Battle of Sipe-Sipe (29 November 1815) {{the central government}} could provide little support to the northern provinces of Salta and Tucumán, which largely had to look after their <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E

Cugir Arms Factory now produces products compatible with NATO standards.|$|R
50|$|The next {{reason is}} that role {{reversal}} prevents the protagonist from being trapped in his <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b> Yablonsky provides another example about the fight within spouses. Through role reversal, the spouses change their positions with the other and then produce new insight of the whole interaction. This technique helps the protagonist to gain more understanding of a significant other rather than being stuck in his own perspective.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} had {{originally intended to}} try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due {{to the findings of}} a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which had concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in his <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Wooten {{pled guilty}} to income tax evasion, after having been indicted on charges in 2001 {{that he had not}} filed or paid taxes between 1995 and 1998.

After Jutah refuses to join with Benoit, Benoit tries to kill Jutah by ejecting him into space. He is rescued by his crew as Benoit seals off Dante.|$|R
25|$|In Griffin v. California (1965), the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} a {{prosecutor}} may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's refusal to testify in his <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the defendant's {{ability to}} {{understand}} {{the charges against him}} and his ability to assist in his <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> was challenged on five separate occasions before and during his trial and sentencing for capital murder, but the trial judge ruled he was competent to stand trial because he did not meet Oklahoma's high standard of proof.|$|E

50|$|Wayne's {{expedition}} through southern New Jersey heightened {{tensions between}} General Washington and New Jersey officials, since it brought on {{a wave of}} British violence, orchestrated by Colonel Mawhood. New Jersey had largely been left to its <b>own</b> <b>defenses</b> during the winter, and the British response to Wayne's movements led New Jersey officials to demand a Continental Army presence. One week after Wayne's departure, Washington sent a small detachment of Continentals into southern New Jersey, but it was wholly ineffective at preventing the crumbling of southern New Jersey militia organizations.|$|R
25|$|After his arrest, Einhorn {{fled the}} country and spent 23 years in Europe before being extradited to the US. He took the stand in his <b>own</b> <b>defense,</b> {{claiming}} his ex-girlfriend {{had been killed by}} CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and is currently serving a life sentence.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, the Navy Administrative Board {{determined}} that Rocha's accusations were exaggerated and that Toussaint was never questioned or {{given the chance}} to testify in his <b>own</b> <b>defense.</b> The three-man board reviewed two days of testimony and ruled that the case was based largely on uncorroborated hearsay. Some witnesses contradicted themselves and Rocha acknowledged getting some of the facts wrong in his Washington Post article and in his original testimony.|$|E
25|$|Chambliss did appeal his conviction, citing {{that much}} of the {{evidence}} presented at his trial—including testimony relating to his activities within the Ku Klux Klan—was circumstantial; that the 14-year delay between the crime and his eventual trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial; and that this delay was a tactic used by the prosecution to gain an advantage over his <b>own</b> <b>defense</b> attorneys. This appeal was dismissed on May 22, 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Challenge is a {{two-stage}} process. The {{first stage}} is clarification, {{which is the}} therapist's effort to confirm that resistance is operating, and also to acquaint the patient with the specific defense being deployed. Patients are often quite unaware of their <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b> Clarification {{takes the form of}} a question, meant to clarify the defense to both patient and therapist: [...] "Do you notice that when you speak of being angry with your boss that you smile and giggle? Is a smile something you sometimes do to cover up a deeper feeling?" ...|$|R
50|$|Czechoslovakia {{was also}} in fear of Hitler and began {{building}} its <b>own</b> <b>defenses.</b> As an ally of France, {{they were able to}} get advice on the Maginot design and apply it to Czechoslovak border fortifications. The design of the casemates is similar to the ones found in the southern part of the Maginot Line and photographs of them are often confused with Maginot forts. Following the Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Germans were able to use the Czech fortifications to plan attacks that proved successful against the western fortifications (the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael is the best known example).|$|R
