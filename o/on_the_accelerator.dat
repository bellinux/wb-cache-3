5|$|Although 47 {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more grip. Edwards felt his car had oversteer during his run. Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career {{with a time of}} 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and Mike Skinner fifth. Biffle, Scott Riggs, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers. The four drivers that failed to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger, Joe Nemechek, John Andretti, and Sauter (who crashed at turn-two on his first qualifying lap). Burney Lamar withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car's potential which was displayed in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator</b> pedal throughout his fastest lap.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body.

25|$|Zimbabwe got a {{good start}} by dismissing both Marshall twins, James and Hamish, in {{successive}} overs. Hamish's dismissal concluded the day, but Zimbabwe would be hopeful before the second day started. That hope quickly turned to despair. Twenty-eight overs were bowled before lunch, but Zimbabwe failed to take a single wicket, and New Zealand moved into a comfortable position at 180 for 2. New Zealand could push <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator,</b> Nathan Astle getting 128 and Lou Vincent 92, as New Zealand amassed 406 runs on the second day. Graeme Cremer, the leg spinner, bowled 24 overs for 111 runs, to illustrate the Zimbabweans' predicament. Test debutant Keith Dabengwa got two for 87, however, suggesting {{that he might be}} a better choice than Cremer for the spinner place in the Zimbabwean team.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons themselves {{had to wait for}} the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the Super Proton Synchrotron, where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The actual experiments were called UA1 (led by Rubbia) and UA2 (led by Pierre Darriulat), and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator</b> end (stochastic cooling). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, a most unusual step for the conservative Nobel Foundation.|$|E
25|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{round of}} the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit {{on the right to}} better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator</b> and the cars collided at 270km/h (170mph) and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.|$|E

2500|$|Ban {{early on}} {{identified}} global warming {{as one of}} the key issues of his administration. In a White House meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions. On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming. Ban stated, [...] "For my generation, coming of age {{at the height of the}} Cold War, fear of nuclear winter seemed the leading existential threat on the horizon. But the danger posed by war to all humanity—and to our planet—is at least matched by climate change" [...] (referring to Global Warming, see [...] portal). On 3 September 2009 he further emphasized his concerns at the World Climate Conference in Geneva, when he stated, [...] "Our foot is stuck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator</b> and we are heading towards an abyss". In September 2014, Ban joined demonstrators in the People's Climate March in New York City, and also called together world leaders for the UN Climate Summit, in preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in late 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency brakes do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the emergency brake {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical emergency brake is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>accelerator</b> and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel emergency brakes when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the emergency brake while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the emergency brake mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT, 1 The {{successful}} {{development of}} a new generation of high current, high voltage, linear induction <b>accelerators</b> relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> solution of a number of beam transport problems, including radial oscillations, diocotron instabilities, transverse beam break-up (BBU), etc. Most of the instabilities appear to onset either at the injector region or at the accelerating gaps. Radial oscillations were first observed in RADLAC I, while transverse beam break-up was first observed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SLAC <b>accelerator,</b> and more recently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ETA <b>accelerator.</b> A low emittance, high current, high voltage injector precisely aligned with the guiding magnetic field axis and beam vacuum pipe axis is of prime importance for successful beam C) acceleration and transport.

The main design features and the comparison for the two schemes are presented.

60|$|The adventurer {{had no time}} to lose.

Some way down there was a narrow side lane, and into this the {{fugitive}} turned, cracking on his high speed and leaving a good five miles between him and any pursuer before he ventured to stop. Then, in a quiet corner, he counted over his booty of the evening--the paltry plunder of Mr. Ronald Barker, the rather better-furnished purses of the actresses, which contained four pounds between them, and, finally, the gorgeous jewellery and well-filled note- book of the plutocrat upon the Daimler. Five notes of fifty pounds, four of ten, fifteen sovereigns, and a number of valuable papers made up a most noble haul. It was clearly enough for one night's work.
