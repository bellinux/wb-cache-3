500|$|Painful {{conditions}} {{which do not}} originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or alveolar mucosa (usually squamous cell carcinoma), {{conditions which}} cause gingivostomatitis and desquamative gingivitis. Various conditions may involve the alveolar bone, and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, infarcts in the jaws caused by sickle cell disease, and osteomyelitis. Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal zoster (maxillary or mandibular division), trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuropathies. Very rarely, a brain tumor might cause toothache. Another chronic facial pain syndrome which can mimic toothache is temporomandibular disorder (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. [...] Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed atypical <b>odontalgia,</b> which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain). Atypical <b>odontalgia</b> may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth).|$|E
5000|$|Atypical <b>odontalgia</b> {{is similar}} in nature to AFP, but the latter term {{generally}} is used where the pain is confined to the teeth or gums, and AFP when the pain involves {{other parts of the}} face. Other sources use atypical <b>odontalgia</b> and AFP as synonyms, or describe atypical <b>odontalgia</b> as a sub-type, variant, or intra-oral equivalent of AFP. Sometimes [...] "phantom tooth pain" [...] is listed as a synonym for AO, and sometimes it is defined as toothache which persists after a tooth has been extracted. It has been suggested that it is likely that these terms do not represent a single, discrete condition, but rather a collection of misdiagnosed and as yet unidentified causes. This pain is often similar to pain from organic dental disease such as periapical periodontitis, or pulpitis (toothache), but unlike normal dental pain, it is not relieved in the long term by dental treatments such as endodontic therapy (root canal treatment) or tooth extraction, and it may even be worsened, return soon after, or simply migrate to other areas in the mouth following dental treatment.|$|E

A total of 40 teeth with cervical exposure were treated in 4 sessions. They were divided into 2 groups according to treatment. A 660 nm wavelength red diode laser and an 830 nm wavelength infrared diode laser were used. Dentine sensitivity to cold nociceptive stimulus was evaluated {{by means of a}} pain numeric scale from zero to 10 before each treatment session, at 15 and 30 min after irradiation, and in a follow-up period of 15, 30 and 60 days after the end of treatment. Significant levels of dentinal desensitization were only found in patients ranging in age from 25 to 35 years. The 660 nm red diode laser was more effective than the 830 nm infrared laser and a higher level of desensitization was observed at the 15 and 30 minute post-irradiation examinations. The immediate and late therapeutic effects of the 660 nm red diode laser were more evident in 25 - 35 -year-old patients compared with those of the 830 nm infrared diode laser, in terms of the different age groups...|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{variability}} and imprecision of their pain symptoms, ATN or atypical <b>odontalgia</b> patients may be misdiagnosed with atypical facial pain (AFP) or [...] "hypochondriasis", {{both of which}} are considered problematic by many practitioners. The term [...] "atypical facial pain" [...] is sometimes assigned to pain which crosses the mid-line of the face or otherwise does not conform to expected boundaries of nerve distributions or characteristics of validated medical entities. As such, AFP is seen to comprise a diagnosis by reduction.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of ATN may {{overlap with}} a pain {{disorder}} occurring in teeth called atypical <b>odontalgia</b> (literal meaning [...] "unusual tooth pain"), with aching, burning, or stabs of pain localized {{to one or}} more teeth and adjacent jaw.

In desperate efforts to alleviate pain, some patients undergo multiple (but unneeded) root canals or extractions, {{even in the absence of}} suggestive X-ray evidence of dental abscess.|$|E
5000|$|Orofacial pain {{has been}} defined as [...] "pain {{localized}} to the region above the neck, in front of the ears and below the orbitomeatal line, as well as pain within the oral cavity; including pain of dental origin and temporomandibular disorders". However, some orofacial pain conditions may involve areas outside this region, e.g. temporal pain in TMD. Toothache, or <b>odontalgia,</b> is any pain perceived in the teeth or their supporting structures (i.e. the periodontium). Toothache is therefore a type of orofacial pain. Craniofacial pain is an overlapping topic which includes pain perceived in the head, face, and related structures, sometimes including neck pain.|$|E
50|$|Atypical <b>odontalgia</b> (AO) is {{very similar}} in many respects to AFP, with some sources {{treating}} them as the same entity, and others describing the former as a sub-type of AFP. Generally, the term AO may be used where the pain is confined to the teeth or gums, and AFP when the pain involves {{other parts of the}} face. As with AFP, there is a similar lack of standardization of terms and no consensus regarding a globally accepted definition surrounding AO. Generally definitions of AO state that it is pain with no demonstrable cause which is perceived to be coming from a tooth or multiple teeth, and is not relieved by standard treatments to alleviate dental pain.|$|E
5000|$|TMD is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} one of the 4 major symptom complexes in chronic orofacial pain, along with burning mouth syndrome, atypical facial pain and atypical <b>odontalgia.</b> TMD has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or rheumatological disorder. It has also been called a functional pain syndrome, and a psychogenic disorder. [...] Others consider TMD a [...] "central sensitivity syndrome", in reference to evidence that TMD might be caused by a centrally mediated sensitivity to pain. It is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between TMD and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, headache, chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain. These disorders have also been theorized to be caused by centrally mediated sensitivity to pain, and furthermore they often occur together.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Toothache {{prevalence}} in {{the overall}} population is considerable. However, for clinical purposes, the classification schemes available {{do not appear to}} be sufficiently sophisticated. Moreover, not all known forms of dental pain are considered. A refined classification that meets current standards is therefore introduced. To facilitate diagnosis, the characteristic features of the various types of <b>odontalgia</b> are summarized. RESULTS: The new classification differentiates among seven different origins of pain: 1. dentinal pain (originating from the pulpal tissues), 2. pulpal pain (originating from the pulpal tissues), 3. periodontal pain, 4. alveolar-osseous pain, 5. atypical <b>odontalgia,</b> 6. heterotopic dental pain, 7. <b>odontalgia</b> associated with primary psychosocial factors. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the proposed classification differentiates among the different forms of <b>odontalgia</b> more precisely than all previous ones. However, its viability and advantages over other available classification schemes still need to be verified in daily practice...|$|E

Herpes Zoster is a less common and endemic disease than varicella, although factors causing reactivation are still not well known, but it occurs in older and/or immunocompromised individuals. Involvement of C 3, T 5, L 1, L 2 and first division of trigeminal nerve are the most frequently encountered whereas the involvement of second and third division of trigeminal nerve is rarely seen. During the prodromal stage, the only presenting symptom may be <b>odontalgia,</b> which {{may prove to be}} a diagnostic challenge for the dentist, since many diseases can cause orofacial pain, and the diagnosis must be properly established before final treatment.

40|$|In {{patients}} with pain, {{it is of}} relevance to use clinical assessments that evaluate the pain modulation. In this thesis, the dynamics of descending inhibition or central sensitization and neuroendocrine analgesia were investigated: in healthy volunteers; in {{patients with}} chronic closed lock of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), before and after discectomy; and finally in patients with possible neuropathic pain, (atypical <b>odontalgia).</b> Pain assessment was made with the eleven point numerical rating scale. The Pain thresholds were determined to evaluate central sensitization, and cold pressor tests of 2 - 4 °C were used to provoke descending noxious inhibitory controls. Plasma β- endorphin was determined by radioimmunoassay. The focus of evaluation was on the change induced by provocation or pain relieving surgery. In study I, we found, that with an exception for the electrical pain threshold over the central maxillary incisor, healthy volunteers increased their electrical and pressure pain thresholds during cold pressor test. There were region and stimuli specific changes between the trigeminal and the spinal region, regarding the change in pain thresholds, but no differences in respect to gender. In study II, we demonstrated that female patients, with chronic closed lock, i. e. limited jaw function and movement-evoked pain from the TMJ, had central sensitization and an elevated neuroendocrine opioid level in plasma. Study III, showed, that in 91 % of female patients with chronic closed lock, the movement-evoked pain had disappeared at a median (range) of 8 (6 - 24) months after TMJ-discectomy. In particular, a clinically substantial reduction in pain intensity was required for a decline in plasma β-endorphin. Central sensitization showed signs to decrease in relation to relief in pain intensity. However, on the whole, central sensitization was not healed. In study IV, we noted that patients with atypical <b>odontalgia</b> had HPA-axis hyperactivity and altered coping together with deficient neuroendocrine opioid release and descending facilitation in the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve during cold pressor test. In conclusion, the outcome measure of pain relivieving surgery is feasibly a clinically substantial improvement in maximal pain intensity, here confirmed by a recovery in plasma β-endorphin. Afference from the pulp was absent from descending inhibition in healthy, and possibly promoted by descending facilitation in atypical <b>odontalgia,</b> indicating that the dentoalveolar region is vulnerable to development of chronic pain...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{frequency}} of clinical pain parameters in patients diagnosed with atypical <b>odontalgia</b> (AO), and the determine the reliability on repeated testing. Methods: 21 adult patients (18 women, 3 men; mean age 56 ± 14 years) diagnosed with atypical <b>odontalgia</b> in an extensive clinical and radiographic examination were recruited from the Orofacial Pain clinics of the Universities in Aarhus (Denmark), and Malmö (Sweden). The inclusion criterion was persistent pain in a tooth or a region where a tooth was extracted, with no signs of relevant pathology. Exclusion criteria were presence of odontogenic pain, primary headaches, or medical, psychiatric or personality disorders. In the sample, the average pain intensity was NRS 4. 0 (0 – 10 scale), and average pain duration 87 months. 75 % reported continuous pain. At the painful tooth, pain on tooth percussion, apical palpation, periodontal probing, and selective cusp loading were recorded. Presence of caries, periodontal pockets > 3 mm, furcation involvement, and bleeding on periodontal probing were noted. After approximately one week, the same examiner repeated the tests. Frequency and 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each listed provocation. Kappa statistics calculated the test-retest reliability. Results: The patients with AO reported pain on tooth percussion in 23. 5 % (4 / 17; 95 % CI: 5. 37 – 41. 63 %), pain on apical palpation in 30 % (6 / 20; 95 % CI: 9. 92 – 50. 08 %), pain on probing in 23. 8 % (5 / 21; 95 % CI: 5. 59 – 42. 01 %), and pain on cusp loading in 4. 8 % (1 / 21; 95 % CI:- 4. 34 – 13. 94 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study {{aimed to}} solve the {{problems}} faced with the previous model of inflammatory tooth pain in rats. METHODS: After cutting 2 mm of the distal extremities, the polyethylene crowns were placed on the mandibular incisors. In contrast to the original model, we used flow composite instead of wire in order to maximize the retention of crowns. Different concentrations of capsaicin (10, 25 and 100 mg/ml) and formalin were administrated into the cavities under the crowns. The algesic agent-induced behaviors were evaluated. RESULTS: The modified model had no liquid leakage. Furthermore, composite allowed the crowns to remain {{for a longer period of}} time. Capsaicin 25, 100 mg/ml and formalin applications induced significantly more painful stimulation compared with control groups (P < 0. 001). These responses were significantly reduced by the administration of ibuprofen, 20 minutes prior to the capsaicin 100 mg/ml injection.
