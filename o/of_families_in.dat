5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, {{making it impossible for}} larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E

The final chapter of the theoretical part discusses <b>family,</b> various types <b>of</b> <b>families</b> and the typology <b>of</b> <b>families.</b> As for the empirical part of the thesis, it presents literary analyses of the motif <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> order to identify it in all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales. The goal is to analyse the motif <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales, particularly the way it is featured in the anthology. Using the typology conceived by Rener, Švab, Žakelj and Humer (2005) we classified the types <b>of</b> <b>families</b> found <b>in</b> the fairy tales according the main literary character. The goal is to analyse the motif <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> all 60 fairy tale stories in Svetlana's Fairy Tales {{on the basis of the}} said typology.
