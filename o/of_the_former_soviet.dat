5|$|In {{countries}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{and other}} eastern European countries, a team {{has in the}} past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E

The armed forces were formed in 1992 using parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Armed Forces {{on the new}} republic's territory. The {{transformation}} of the ex-Soviet forces into the Armed Forces of Belarus, which was completed in 1997, {{reduced the number of}} its soldiers by 30,000 and restructured its leadership and military formations.|$|E
5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus {{are capable of}} {{producing}} lightning much like the clouds on Earth. The existence of lightning had been controversial outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006–2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their intermittent appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is {{at least half of}} that on Earth.|$|E

5000|$|Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine founded <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>of</b> Independent States (CIS) in December 1991. It was {{conceived}} as a successor organization to the USSR, and in December 1993 it included 12 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15 <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> republics (except <b>the</b> three Baltic states). It currently consists <b>of</b> nine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15 <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> republics, with one participating state (Ukraine) and one associate state (Turkmenistan). Georgia withdrew from the CIS in August 2008.|$|R
5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union use a wider rail gauge than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} Arabians were {{exported}} {{from behind}} the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who did come to the west {{caught the eye of}} breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, {{and the rise of the}} European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E

5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, twelve Japanese {{films have}} been nominees for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and one film, Departures, {{has won the}} award. The only Japanese {{directors}} to have multiple films be nominated for the award are Akira Kurosawa and Noboru Nakamura. Kurosawa received an Honorary Award prior to {{the inception of the}} formal award for his work on Rashomon and the actual Academy Award for Dersu Uzala (submitted for the former Soviet Union), and had four other films submitted, with two of them accepted as nominees. Notably, Kurosawa's 1985 film Ran was deliberately not nominated by the Japanese film industry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film due to the poor perception he had among Japanese filmmakers at the time. Nakamura had two films, Twin Sisters of Kyoto and Portrait of Chieko, submitted as nominees for the award. Among all the countries that have submitted films for the award, Japan ranks fifth in terms of total nominees, behind Sweden (fourteen nominees) and ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union (nine nominees).|$|E
5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the dressing process. Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Games {{were the}} last {{to be held in}} the same year as the Summer Games. They were hosted in the French Savoie region in the city of Albertville, though only 18 events were held in the city. The rest of the events were spread out over the Savoie. Political changes of the time were {{reflected}} in the Olympic teams appearing in France: this was the first Games to be held after the fall of Communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Germany competed as a single nation {{for the first time since}} the 1964 Games; former Yugoslavian republics Croatia and Slovenia made their debuts as independent nations; most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> republics still competed as a single team known as the Unified Team, but the Baltic States made independent appearances for the first time since before World War II. At 16years old, Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion. New Zealand skier Annelise Coberger became the first Winter Olympic medallist from the southern hemisphere when she won a silver medal in the women's slalom.|$|E

Ewing, Olajuwon, and Kirilenko are naturalized U.S. citizens, and Duncan and Bell are U.S. citizens by birth, but they are still considered international players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.|$|E
