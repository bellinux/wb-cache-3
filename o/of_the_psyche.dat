5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

25|$|Jung {{established}} {{a school of}} psychology which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and unconscious components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche)</b> through a process called individuation. Through studying folklore, world mythologies, and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> as expressions of instinctual patterns (or archetypes). The role of the psychoanalyst in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being {{cut off from the}} meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that the psyche is the source of healing and the drive toward individuation.|$|E

40|$|We {{postulate}} that <b>the</b> human <b>psyche</b> is {{a particular}} excitation of an underlying universal psychic (consciousness) quantum field. <b>The</b> human <b>psyche</b> is postulated to have a representation similar to a quantum system, with virtual and physical states corresponding to the potentiality and actuality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human mind. We postulate that free will plays {{a central role in}} the transition from potentiality to actuality and vice versa. We model <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> as a non-Abelian and supersymmetric quantum field, with its interactions mediated by another supersymmetric vector quantum field. We propose a model for <b>the</b> ground state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human species, and show how an individual's psyche is created as excitations on the individual's ground state. We briefly give a quantum description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waking and sleeping states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>psyche,</b> and lastly propose a model for <b>the</b> substructure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>psyche</b> based on <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> bound and entangled states...|$|R
25|$|Sigmund Freud {{put forward}} {{the idea that}} {{symbolic}} communication {{does not depend on}} cultural history alone but also on the workings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche.</b> Thus Freud introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. Dream interpretation is the basis of Freudian myth interpretation and Freud's concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. This suggestion would find an important point of rapprochment between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in Freud's thought.|$|E
25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche,</b> he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E
25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> through greater {{awareness}} of the physical body and emotions. There are various body-oriented approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) character-analytic vegetotherapy and orgonomy; neo-Reichian bioenergetic analysis; somatic experiencing; integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz's Hakomi psychotherapy; sensorimotor psychotherapy; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E

25|$|The eminent Jewish theologian and philosopher, Martin Buber, had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in psychoanalysis, {{and may have}} attended the same Eranos conference with Jung in 1934. In 1952 Buber and Jung exchanged letters regarding a paper Buber had published entitled “Religion and Modern Thinking”. In his rejoinder, Buber claimed that Jung had strayed outside his realm of expertise into theology by asserting that God does not exist independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyches</b> <b>of</b> human beings. He concluded that Jung was “mystically deifying <b>the</b> instincts instead <b>of</b> hallowing them in faith”, which he called a “modern manifestation of Gnosis”.|$|R

25|$|The African influence, which {{introduced}} anatomical simplifications, {{along with}} expressive features reminiscent of El Greco, are the generally assumed {{starting point for}} the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. But that wasn't all. Aside from further influences of the Symbolists, Pierre Daix explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of Claude Lévi-Strauss on the subject of myth. And too, without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism came not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche.</b>|$|E
25|$|Study of the {{unconscious}} mind, a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In {{one of the first}} psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C. S. Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference. Freud popularized this concept, with terms like Freudian slip entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech and action. His 1901 text The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.|$|E
25|$|The letter yud (י) is {{depicted}} by a point with a cusp at its head. The point-like {{nature of the}} yud corresponds to the sefirah of chochmah, which is likened to the initial spark, or point of potential through which a new insight enters reality. The cusp, or tip of the yud reaches upwards and alludes to the super-conscious root of chochmah, which resides in Keter. The first letter hei (ה) of the Tetragrammaton represents {{the expansion of the}} point of the 'yud' into all three spatial dimensions. This corresponds to the sefirah of Binah, which expands and develops the seminal point of wisdom (chochmah) into a detailed idea. The letter vav (ו) resembles a vertical line that connects the higher intellectual faculties with the emotive powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>psyche.</b> The gematria of the letter vav is 6, corresponding to the six emotive sefirot from loving-kindness to foundation. The final letter hei (ה) of the Tetragrammaton represents the sefirah of malchut.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{observations}} {{from more than}} fifty years of research into an important subgroup of non-ordinary states of consciousness that he calls holotropic, the author suggests a revision of some basic assumptions of modern psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy.

500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Psyche</b> myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
500|$|Keats {{was exposed}} to a few sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Psyche</b> myth. His {{contemporary}} sources for the myth included Lempriere's Classical Dictionary and Mary Tighe's Psyche, an 1805 work that Keats read {{as a child and}} returned to in 1818. Keats wrote to his brother George, just a few months before writing [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{to say that he was}} no longer delighted by Tighe's writing. Dissatisfied, he turned to Apuleius's Golden Ass, translated by William Adlington in 1566, and read through the earlier version of the Cupid and Psyche myth. After reading the work and realizing that the myth was established during the twilight of Roman mythology, Keats wrote to George: [...] "You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour—and perhaps never thought of in the old religion—I am more orthodox than to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected." ...|$|E
