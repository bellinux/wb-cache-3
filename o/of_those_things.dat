It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E

500|$|Although Fightstar's {{style is}} widely known as post-hardcore, they have {{incorporated}} diverse musical influences {{and have been}} called metal, emo, and alternative rock. According to Kerrang!, the band's influences are post-rock, heavy metal and hardcore punk. Simpson echoed this, describing their musical aim as trying to [...] "combine the light and dark shades, to make something utterly brutal and really heavy {{and on the other}} side have something really delicate and beautiful. The fusion <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> is what Fightstar does." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Emma Barrow of The Daily Telegraph, {{the match}} {{is said to}} have instigated the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United, which {{continued}} through the 1990s and 2000s. In later years, Winterburn said of the brawl: [...] "It probably caused a lot of the bad blood between the sides that has lasted for years but I was just competitive and desperate to win.

500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

Howe stated, [...] "I've never seen one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> in my life, but I'll take the job."
