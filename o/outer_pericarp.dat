The forms of the underlying functions are determined using experimental data for <b>Outer</b> <b>Pericarp,</b> Intermediate Layer, Aleurone and Starchy Endosperm generated from spectroscopic analysis of milled fractions of a hard and a soft wheat milled under Sharp-to-Sharp (S-S) and Dull-to-Dull (D-D) dispositions. For the hard Mallacca wheat, the <b>Outer</b> <b>Pericarp,</b> Intermediate Layer and Aleurone compositions mostly varied with particle size in similar ways, consistent with these layers fusing together as “bran” and breaking together, although with possibly a subtle difference around the production of very fine particles under D-D milling. By contrast, for the soft Consort wheat, <b>Outer</b> <b>Pericarp,</b> Intermediate Layer and Aleurone were distributed in broken particles very differently, particularly under D-D milling, suggesting a different breakage mechanism associated with differences in the mechanical properties and adhesion of the bran layers.

40|$|The tomato fruit {{consists}} of a thick, fleshy pericarp composed predominantly of highly vacuolated parenchymatous cells, which surrounds the seeds. During ripening, the activation of gene expression results in dramatic biochemical and physiological changes in the pericarp. The polygalacturonase (PG) gene, unlike many fruit ripening-induced genes, is not activated by the increase in ethylene hormone concentration associated {{with the onset of}} ripening. To investigate ethylene concentration-independent gene transcription in ripe tomato fruit, we analyzed the expression of chimeric PG pmmoter-B-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene fusions in transgenic tomato plants. We determined that a 1. 4 -kb PG promoter directs ripening-regulated transcription in <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> but not in inner pericarp cells, with a sharp boundary of PG promoter activity located midway through the pericarp. Promoter deletion analysis indicated that a minimum of three promoter regions influence the spatial regulation of PG transcription. A positive regulatory region from- 231 to- 134 promotes gene transcription in the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> of ripe fruit. A second positive regulatory region from- 806 to- 443 extends gene activity to the inner pericarp. However, a negative regulatory region from- 1411 to- 1150 inhibits gene transcription in the inner pericarp. DNase I footprint analysis showed that nuclear proteins in unripe and ripe fruit interact with DNA sequences within each of these three regulatory regions. Thus, temporal and spatial control of PG transcription is mediated by the interaction of negative and positive regulatory promoter elements, resulting in gene activity in the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> but not the inner pericarp of ripe tomato fruit. The expression pattern of PG suggests that, although they are morphologically similar, there is a fundamental difference between the parenchymatous cells within the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp...</b>|$|E

40|$|Immature green tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) fruits {{undergo a}} period of {{transient}} starch accumulation characterized by developmental changes {{in the activities of}} key enzymes in the sucrose (Suc) -to-starch metabolic pathway. Activities of Suc synthase, fructokinase, ADP-glucose (Glc) pyrophosphorylase, and soluble and insoluble starch synthases decline dramatically in parallel to the decrease in starch levels in the developing fruit. Comparison of "maximal" in vitro activities of the enzymes in the Suc-to-starch pathway suggests that these same enzymes are limiting to the rate of starch accumulation. In contrast, activities of invertase, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, and phosphoglucomutase do not exhibit dramatic decreases in activity and appear to be in excess of starch accumulation rates. Starch accumulation is spatially localized in the inner and radial pericarp and columella, whereas the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> and seed locule contain little starch. The seed locule is characterized by lower activities of Suc synthase, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase, ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and soluble and insoluble starch synthases.

This deficiency corresponds {{to a lack of}} accumulation of β-amylase activity in the endosperm and does not affect the level of activity in the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> and green tissues as compared to the normal line. Two antigenically related but distinct β-amylases (I and II) were detected in the normal line (II being the major constituent) and only one (I) in the mutant line. I and II display very similar electrophoretic polymorphism. In both lines, I appears to be ubiquitous, although it disappears from the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> during ripening. Antigen II was present only in the normal line and appears to be specific for the endosperm and perhaps for the maternal green tissues of the seed. Posttranslational modifications occurring during germination, which are mimicked by the action of papain, affect II but not I.

Polymeric neutral sugar and phenolic acid contents of the samples were determined and used to identify specific composition patterns in each tissue irrespective of the cultivar. The scutellum and embryonic axis showed the lowest amount of carbohydrates with similar relative amounts of arabinose and xylose (Ara+Xyl), but the scutellum differed from the embryonic axis in its high phenolic acid, in particular ferulate dehydrodimer, content. The peripheral layers of the grains were mainly composed of cell wall polysaccharides, chiefly arabinoxylans but with differing structures. The hyaline layer was mostly composed of arabinoxylan with extremely low Ara/Xyl ratio (0. 1), with high amounts of ferulic acid monomers and hence very weakly crosslinked.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} developing and ripening triticale cv. Dagro caryopses. Increasing capability for precocious germination of the caryopses was seen as development and maturation progressed. A significant role of the embryoless parts of the caryopses (testa, pericarp and endosperm) in preventing germination processes was found. Isolated embryos (after 8 days of incubation) germinated by 100 % from the 32 nd day after flowering, while only 10 % of whole caryopses from this sample germinated. Removal of the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> strongly stimulated germination of unripe caryopses. However, incising the caryopses near the embryo only slightly stimulated this process, which indicates that hypoxia of the embryo is {{not the cause of}} triticale embryo dormancy. Another very sensitive indicator of release of dormancy in the caryopses was the increased synthesis of embryo polyribosomal RNA induced by germination. The results of investigations on RNA synthesis in embryos - which undergoes extreme intensification when germination processes are initiated in the caryopses - were in agreement with those of biological studies based on observation of the elongation of the radicle. The lowest inhibition of transcription in the embryo was found when it was completely separated from the testa, pericarp and endosperm. A smaller effect was seen upon removal of the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> from developing and ripening caryopses, and decidedly the smallest effect still of incising the caryopses near the embryo...|$|E

40|$|Kiwifruit are of huge {{economic}} {{importance for}} New Zealand representing 29 {{percent of total}} horticultural exports. Fruit size is the biggest determinant of what consumers are willing to pay, {{and there is also}} a positive relationship between consumer preference for flavour and percentage dry matter. The two main cultivars exported from New Zealand are Actinidia chinensis ‘Hort 16 A’ (gold kiwifruit) and A. deliciosa ‘Hayward’ (green kiwifruit). Under current commercial practice the only product allowed for use on kiwifruit to increase fruit size in New Zealand is Benefit®. Benefit® has been shown to induce different results when applied to A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, whereas synthetic plant growth regulators such as the cytokinin-like substance N-(2 - chloro- 4 -pyridyl) -N’-phenylurea (CPPU) have been found to promote similar increases in fresh weight of fruit in both cultivars. Final fruit size is determined by both cell division and cell enlargement. It was been shown that fresh weight can be increased in both of the major Actinidia cultivars even though their physiology differs. Hormonal control of fruit size in relation to cell division and cell enlargement phases of fruit growth was studied in both A. chinensis and A. deliciosa. CPPU was applied to both cultivars in a growth response experiment where fruit were collected throughout the growing season. The objective of this experiment was to create growth curves, to compare and contrast the effect on A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, and to provide material for hormone analysis. Application of CPPU was found to significantly increase the fresh weight of both A. chinensis and A. deliciosa fruit (46. 98 and 31. 34 g increases respectively), and alter the ratio of inner and <b>outer</b> <b>pericarps</b> of A. chinensis fruit. CPPU and Benefit® were applied individually and together to both cultivars. It was found that only A. chinesis fruit were affected by the application of Benefit®; fresh weight was increased by 26. 38 g, and percentage dry matter was significantly reduced. There was a statistically significant (p < 0. 05) interaction between CPPU and Benefit® when applied to A. chinensis. 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyloxyacetic acid (3, 5, 6 -TPA) was applied to A. deliciosa on two application dates at three concentrations and was found to decrease fresh weight of fruit, but significantly increase percentage dry matter regardless of application date or concentration. Lastly CPPU and 1 -naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) were applied to A. deliciosa at two application dates and in all combinations. Application date affected the response to both a low concentration of CPPU and NAA. A synergistic interaction was observed when CPPU was applied early plus NAA late (CPPU early (4. 53 g increase) plus NAA late (13. 29 g) < CPPU early plus NAA late (33. 85 g). Finally endogenous hormone content was studied. Methods were developed and tested for the simultaneous analysis of both indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins. Freeze dried fruit were purified using Waters Sep-pak® cartridges and Oasis® columns then IAA was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography.

Overexpression of the CDKB genes at later stages of development and the down-regulation of CDKA 1 result in a very similar fruit phenotype, showing a reduction in the number of cell layers in the pericarp and alterations in the desiccation of the fruits.

The enzyme protein, as detected immunologically on Western blots, is present during the early stages of ripening, before any enzyme activity is detectable. The mRNA for the enzyme is also present at these stages; endo-ß-mannanase may be produced and sequestered in a mature-sized inactive form during early ripening.

40|$|Cereals are {{cultivated}} grasses {{that are}} grown throughout the world. As well as providing food for man, they, or fractions derived from processing them, make {{an important contribution}} to the diets of farm stock. Cereal grains have a long storage life under favourable conditions because they are harvested at a relatively low moisture content and comprise stable components. The principal energy sources within the grains are protected from infestation by outer coverings that are difficult to penetrate and in some cases unpalatable components in the coverings discourage predation by wild populations. The largest morphological component of all grains is the starchy endosperm, and approximately 80 % of this is starch, occurring as microscopical granules with forms characteristic of the species. Also characteristic of the species are the storage proteins, which make the next largest contribution to endosperm dry weight. Proteins are important both as nutrients and by virtue {{of the fact that the}} class includes enzymes which, although making a small contribution to grain weight, can have a marked effect on grain quality and hence price. Other chemical components present as minor contributors, but with potential for exerting significant nutritional influence, are phytates and tannins, and current knowledge of these is briefly discussed. The walls of endosperm cells comprise a complex mixture of polysaccharides including cellulose, arabinoxylans, and β-glucans, as well as proteins and esterified phenolic acids.

40|$|Correlative {{physiological}} {{evidence suggests}} that membrane transport into storage parenchyma cells is a key step in determining hexose levels accumulated in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit (Ruan et al. 1997). Expression of three previously identified hexose transporter genes (LeHT 1, 2 and 3) demonstrated that LeHT 3, {{and to a lesser}} extent LeHT 1, are the predominant transporters expressed in young fruit (10 d after anthesis; DAA). Expression of both transporters dropped sharply until 24 DAA, after which only LeHT 3 expression remained at detectable levels through to fruit ripening. LeHT 2 was not expressed substantially until the onset of fruit ripening. For fruit at both 10 and 30 DAA, LeHT 3 transcripts were detected in storage parenchyma cells of the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> tissue, but not in vascular bundles or the first layer of parenchyma cells surrounding these bundles. In contrast to LeHT gene expression, hexose transporter protein levels were maximal between 20 and 30 DAA, which corresponded to the period of highest hexose accumulation. The delayed appearance of transporter protein is consistent with some form of post-transcriptional regulation. Based on these analyses, LeHT 3 appears to be responsible for the rapid hexose accumulation in developing tomato fruit. © CSIRO 2005...|$|E

In the present work, 86 rice samples (Oryza saliva L.) and 7 rice husk samples were digested by dry ashing for the purpose of determining the total Sr levels by ICP-OES. The mean concentrations found were: 0. 281 µg g- 1 for milled, 0. 287 µg g- 1 for parboiled milled, 0. 564 µg g- 1 for brown, 0. 73 µg g- 1 for parboiled brown, and 1. 16 µg g- 1 for paddy rice, and 3. 44 µg g- 1 for the rice husks. Validation of the method was conducted with a certified reference material, NIST CAM 8418 Wheat Gluten, and the recovery obtained ranged from 89 - 98 %. As the <b>outer</b> layers (aleurone, <b>pericarp)</b> of the grain are removed, the Sr concentration decreases. It can then be assumed that most of the Sr is stored in these layers. Although no extensive data exist for Sr levels in rice, the values obtained are in good agreement with the results reported for Sr in brown rice from Japan (0. 25 - 0. 72 µg g- 1) and with non-contaminated foodstuffs {{from other parts of the}} world. Thus, the Uruguayan rice has Sr levels that match non-contaminated samples and its consumption presents no health threat. Publicado en: Atomic Spectroscopy. [...] 2006, 27 (3) : 80 - 85 </p...|$|R

Anthocyanin expression was reduced in backcross populations compared to F 2 populations. Anthocyanin concentration, {{as measured by the}} pH differential method, of pigment-rich pericarp and skin tissues from LA 1996 was estimated to be 20. 6 mg/ 100 g and 66. 5 mg/ 100 g, respectively. Anthocyanidin composition was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fruit of accession LA 1996 contained predominantly petunidin, followed by malvidin and delphinidinin. Lycopene, b-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene levels were similar to those of normal tomatoes and lower than those found in high pigment tomatoes. Anthocyanins are the most common class of purple, red, and blue plant pigments. More than 300 different anthocyani...|$|E
40|$|The tomato Anthocyanin fruit (Aft) {{genotype}} {{is characterized}} by purple color in skin and <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> of its fruits due {{to higher levels of}} anthocyanins—flavonoid metabolites. Our objectives were to carry out metabolic and molecular characterization of this genotype, emphasizing its interaction with the high pigment- 1 (hp- 1) mutation, known to increase flavonoids in tomato fruits. These objectives fit the growing interest in developing tomato fruits with higher levels of functional metabolites. Our results show that 1) Aft fruits are also characterized by significantly higher levels of the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol, thus enhancing their functional value; 2) the tomato Anthocyanin 1 (Ant 1) gene, encoding a Myb transcription factor, displayed nucleotide and amino acid polymorphisms between the Aft genotype and cultivated genotypes; 3) a DNA marker based on Ant 1 showed that the Aft trait is encoded by a single locus on chromosome 10 fully associated with Ant 1; and 4) double homozygotes Aft/Aft hp- 1 /hp- 1 plants displayed a more-than-additive effect on the production of fruit anthocyanidins and flavonols. This effect was manifested by approximately 5 -, 19 -, and 33 -fold increase of petunidin, malvidin, and delphinidin, respectively, in the double mutants compared with the cumulative levels of their parental lines. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that occur naturally in most plants. Flavonoids are present in fruits, vegetables...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} {{of water into}} harvest-ripe grains of dormant and non-dormant genotypes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated using Magnetic Resonance Micro-Imaging (MRMI). Images of virtual sections, both longitudinal and transverse, throughout the grain were collected at intervals {{after the start of}} imbibition and used to reconstruct a picture of water location within the different grain tissues and changes over time. The observations were supplemented by the weighing measurements of water content and imbibition of grains in water containing I 2 /KI which stains starch and lipid, thereby acting as a marker for water. In closely related genotypes, with either a dormant or a non-dormant phenotype, neither the rate of increase in water content nor the pattern of water distribution within the grain was significantly different until 18 h, when germination became apparent in the non-dormant genotype. Water entered the embryo and scutellum during the very early stages of imbibition through the micropyle and by 2 h water was clearly evident in the micropyle channel. After 12 h of imbibition, embryo structures such as the coleoptile and radicle were clearly distinguished. Although water accumulated between the inner (seed coat) and <b>outer</b> (<b>pericarp)</b> layers of the coat surrounding the grain, there was no evidence for {{movement of}} water directly across the coat and into the underlying starchy endosperm...|$|E
40|$|The pedicel {{of tomato}} fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv `Rutgers') of {{different}} developmental stages from immature-green (IG) to red was injected {{on the vine}} with 7 microcuries [14 C(U) ]sucrose and harvested after 18 hours. Cell walls were isolated from <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> and further fractionated yielding ionically associated pectin, covalently bound pectin, hemicellulosic fraction I, hemicellulosic fraction II, and cellulosic fraction II. The dry weight of the total cell wall and of each cell wall fraction per gram fresh weight of pericarp tissue decreased after the mature-green (MG) stage of development. Incorporation of radiolabeled sugars into each fraction decreased from the IG to MG 3 (locules jellied but still green) stage. Incorporation in all fractions increased from MG 3 to breaker and turning (T) and then decreased from T to red. Data indicate that cell wall synthesis continues throughout ripening and increases transiently from MG 4 (locules jellied and yellow to pink in color) to T, corresponding to the peak in respiration and ethylene synthesis during the climacteric. Synthesis continued {{at a time when}} total cell wall fraction dry weight decreased indicating the occurrence of cell wall turnover. Synthesis and insertion of a modified polymer with removal of other polymers may produce a less rigid cell wall and allow softening of the tissue integrity during ripening...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is a non-destructive {{imaging method}} that enables acquisition of three-dimensional (3 D) images of sub-surface structures of semi-transparent and turbid objects. This {{technology is a}} potential tool to provide new information about the structural nature of horticultural products. This work used kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa x chinensis, 'G 14 ') {{as a case study}} to develop an appropriate OCT image capture and analysis method, to characterise microstructural properties of the large parenchyma cells such as: total volume, surface area, maximum length and equivalent diameter. An automated image processing protocol was established using Avizo (R) 7. 1. Raw images were pre-treated using smoothing filters by averaging a small box of voxels. Image segmentation was carried out by automated interactive threshold binarisation, which identifies black voids (large cells) from the background (the rest of the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> tissue) based on two manually-selected grey level threshold values. Connected cells were separated by applying a watershed algorithm and then displayed using a cyclic colour-map so that objects in close proximity were labelled in a different colour. Screening of mislabelled objects was conducted by selecting specified ranges of microstructural properties of the cells, which had been previously identified, based on manual selection of cells using a 'wrapping' method. A final 'closing' process was applied to fill up small voids within cells as well as to smoothen cells boundaries. The resulting methodology enabled non-destructive characterisation of cellular structure immediately beneath the epidermis of kiwifruit. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the roles of the apoplasmic and symplasmic pathways in the delivery of solutes to the <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> of developing green-fleshed kiwifruit berries (Actinidia deliciosa [A. Chev. ] C. F. Liang et A. R. Ferguson var. deliciosa ‘Hayward’). Experiments with the symplasmic tracer 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein (CF) showed symplasmic movement of dye during the initial rapid growth stage of the fruit, but as fruit growth slowed and starch content increased, a reduction in symplasmic spread of CF was observed (+ 126 DAA [days after anthesis]). Measurements of sugar uptake rates from the apoplasm were sufficient to account for the dry matter accumulation in growing fruit at each stage of fruit growth, and could potentially operate alongside a symplasmic pathway for post-phloem unloading of sugars during the rapid growth period. Energy requirements driving uptake from the apoplasm appear to depend on the sugar concentration gradients across the cell membrane throughout fruit development. Together, these data suggest: 1) the post-phloem symplasmic pathway is important during the fruit rapid growth stage, 2) the uptake of sugars from the apoplasm has a role in the transport of carbohydrates in the fruit, especially later in fruit development when the symplasmic pathway is reduced, and 3) apoplasmic sugar has {{an important role in the}} flow of water into the apoplasm of the fruit, providing a mechanism to maintain hydrostatic pressure gradients along the phloem supplying the fruit...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined in three kiwifruit (Actinidia) species including A. deliciosa, A. chinensis, and A. arguta. Among the species tested, the highest SOD activity {{was found in}} crude extracts prepared from fruit tissues of A. deliciosa. The highest enzyme activity was localized in seed, followed by locules, core and <b>outer</b> <b>pericarp</b> (OP). SOD activity in crude extract of whole fruit remained stable {{for at least one}} month when stored at - 20 ℃. The effect of synthetic protease inhibitors (PI) on SOD activity was investigated. Supplementing crude kiwifruit extracts with PI improved SOD activity in freshly prepared extracts, and in extracts stored at 4 ℃, but had no effect on those stored at - 20 ℃. Among the PI used, iodoacetamide (an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, for example, actinidin which is a principal protease found in kiwifruit) and PMSF (an inhibitor of serine proteases), had the most and least influence on SOD activity in crude kiwifruit extracts, respectively. There was a significant increase in SOD activity in kiwifruit (that were relatively firm) when the fruits were stored at low temperature (4 ℃). An increase in SOD activity was also correlated with a decrease in fruit firmness. Staining fruit tissues with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) provided evidence for stress-induced superoxide generation in kiwifruit tissues. Taken together, the changes in SOD activity and the capacity for stress-inducible superoxide production in post-harvest kiwifruit suggest that SOD might play a fundamental role in the storage life/ripening of kiwifruit...|$|E
