40|$|In {{our earlier}} work, silica-based diatom frustules were {{successfully}} converted to 3 -dimesional F-doped titania-based replicas via shape-preserving gas/solid displacement reactions, and experiments {{showed that the}} hydrolysis of <b>organophosphorous</b> <b>ester</b> pesticides, methyl paraoxon (MOX) and methyl parathion (MTH) was significantly faster {{in the presence of}} these 3 -D titania nanostructures than in the presence of other commercial titania nanoparticles. The enhancement effect of titania frustules appeared to be strongly related to the amount of F-doping on these materials. In this work, a wider range of titania frustule replicas with various F-doping were prepared and characterized, and compared in the hydrolysis of MOX and MTH as well as three carboxylic acids (methyl salicylate, methyl benzoate and methyl 4 -(aminomethyl) benzoate). A strong relationship between the amount of F-doping and the enhancement effect on the hydrolysis of organophosphorous esters was still observed. However, such enhancement effect did not occur in the hydrolysis of the carboxylic acids. It was discovered that fluorine-leaching from the titania frustules was significant and yielded high concentration of fluoride ions in the reaction solutions. Dissolved fluoride ions alone could significantly catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphorous esters but not that of carboxylic acids in the oxide-free systems. It is believed that fluoride ions act as nucleophilic catalysts to accelerate the hydrolysis of organophosphorous esters. Comparison in the hydrolysis product formation from the two potential hydrolysis pathways (i. e., the P-O bond and the C-O bond cleavages) in the studied systems also supports the direct involvement of dissolved fluoride ions in the observed catalytic effect.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{microscale}} assemblies of fluorine-doped tit-ania nanoparticles were synthesized from silica-based diatom microshells (frustules) via a shape-preserving reactive {{conversion process}} (as per {{the method of}} Unocic et al.). The nanostructured F-doped titania frustules were found to induce rapid hydrolysis of the <b>organophosphorous</b> <b>esters,</b> methyl paraoxon, and methyl parathion (insecticides and nerve agent mimics), under mild con-ditions (pH 4. 5 â€“ 7. 9, 221 C) {{and in the absence}} of light. Fluorine doping of the titania frustules, which altered the surface Lewis acidity, was found to have a strong impact on the rate of hy-drolysis. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhosphonium ions {{are shown}} {{to undergo a}} gas-phase Meerwein {{reaction}} in which epoxides (or thioepoxides) undergo three-to-five-membered ring expansion to yield dioxaphospholanium (or oxathiophospholanium) ion products. When the association reaction is followed by collision-induced dissociation (CID), the oxirane (or thiirane) is eliminated, making this ion molecule reaction/CID sequence a good method of net oxygen-by-sulfur replacement in the phosphonium ions. This replacement results in a characteristic mass shift of 16 units and provides evidence for the cyclic nature of the gas-phase Meerwein product ions, while improving selectivity for phosphonium ion detection. This reaction sequence also constitutes a gas-phase route to convert phosphonium ions into their sulfur analogs. Phosphonium and related ions are important targets since they are commonly and readily formed in mass spectrometric analysis upon dissociative electron ionization of <b>organophosphorous</b> <b>esters.</b> The Meerwein reaction should provide a new and very useful method of recognizing compounds that yield these ions, which includes a number of chemical warfare agents. The Meerwein reaction proceeds by phosphonium ion addition to the sulfur or oxygen center, followed by intramolecular nucleophilic attack with ring expansion to yield the 1, 3, 2 -dioxaphospholanium or 1, 3, 2 -oxathiophospholanium ion. Product ion structures were investigated by CID tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) experiments and corroborated by DFT/HF calculations...|$|R
