5|$|The Hot Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin 50 and Hot Latin Tracks), {{published}} in Billboard magazine, {{is a record}} chart based on Latin music airplay. The data were compiled by the Billboard chart and research department with information from 70 Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those radio stations were selected based on their number <b>of</b> <b>listeners,</b> {{and were asked to}} report their playlists for the week. This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States. Before this chart's inception, the Latin music information on the magazine was presented only {{in the form of the}} biweekly album sales chart Top Latin Albums, which continues to be listed separately.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} the band's first after joining the main Victor Entertainment roster, after {{releasing}} two albums with Victor sub-label BabeStar. After {{the release of}} Night Fishing, the band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were choosing between, none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of making music for a much wider group <b>of</b> <b>listeners,</b> and was surprised when all of the members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions <b>of</b> <b>listeners</b> who previously had ignored it.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} how the perception <b>of</b> <b>listener</b> envelopment is changed when altering the sidewall material {{in a computer}} model of a real concert hall. The research question {{is based on the}} lack of information on how the frequency content of the late arriving sound energy affects listener envelopment, but also on the conclusion that envelopment is an affect to large degree of late lateral reflective sounds. A computerized model is used for the purpose to take the research <b>of</b> <b>listener</b> envelopment into a more real acoustical situation than before. Alterations of the late lateral reflections are done by using four side wall materials attaining different sets of absorptions coefficients. A listening test is used for evaluating the change <b>of</b> <b>listener</b> envelopment and 21 listeners conducted the test. Results from earlier research were used to explain the attained results from the ANOVA tests. Sidewall materials which absorbs high frequencies and those that are nonabsorbent creates larger sensations <b>of</b> <b>listener</b> envelopment than materials in which absorbs low, low-mid and mid frequencies in this particular hall.
