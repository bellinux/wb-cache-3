Along with the family Noasauridae, abelisaurids are included in the superfamily Abelisauroidea, which is in turn a subdivision of the infraorder Ceratosauria. Abelisaurids are known for their tall skulls with blunt snouts, extensive sculpturing on the outer surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> bones (convergent with carcharodontosaurids), very reduced (atrophied) forelimbs (convergent with tyrannosaurids), and stocky hindlimb proportions, among other features.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To define an objective, easy to perform, rapid {{method for}} <b>the</b> {{assessment}} <b>of</b> ocular synkinesis by employing both <b>the</b> <b>Facial</b> Assessment by Computer Evaluation software and a modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glasgow <b>Facial</b> Palsy Scale. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Fifty normal subjects and 50 patients with known ocular synkinesis were studied. Measurements of ocular synkinesis were made using <b>the</b> semiautomated <b>Facial</b> Assessment by Computer Evaluation software, and a modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automated Glasgow <b>Facial</b> Palsy program. RESULTS: The mean resting vertical palpebral fissure {{width of a}} normal eye was 10. 17 mm (standard deviation [SD], 1. 63 mm), and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> eye closure during smile was on average 21. 56 % (SD, 13. 38 %). Synkinetic eyes had a statistically significantly smaller resting palpebral fissure width on average (8. 99 mm; SD, 1. 61 mm; P <. 001, t test), and a statistically significantly greater degree of narrowing during smiling (32. 65 %; SD, 13. 68 %; P <. 001, t test). Using a modified synkinesis-determining application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glasgow <b>Facial</b> Palsy Scale did not consistently correlate with <b>the</b> <b>Facial</b> Assessment by Computer Evaluation program or clinical observations of eye closure during smiling (R = 0. 251, Pearson correlation) and puckering (R = 0. 253, Pearson correlation). CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>Facial</b> Assessment by Computer Evaluation program yields rapid, consistent, palpebral fissure width measurements, and when combined with a subjective self-assessment questionnaire yields a comprehensive measure of ocular synkinesis. Our modified application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glasgow <b>Facial</b> Palsy Scale {{did not appear to}} be a reliable method for quantitative ocular synkinesis assessment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] - <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this report}} is to {{demonstrate}} how to measure <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FAS <b>facial</b> phenotype using <b>the</b> new 4 -Digit Diagnostic Code and the previously developed D-Score and to demonstrate how these two measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FAS <b>facial</b> phenotype correlate with brain function and structure; correlations that fail to be identified by the older gestalt method <b>of</b> <b>facial</b> measurement. <b>The</b> D-Score and <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 -Digit Code quantitatively measure <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FAS <b>facial</b> phenotype using three facial features (palpebral fissure length, philtrum smoothness and upper lip thinness). These facial measurement systems were developed by the Washington State FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FASDPN) of clinics and are used to screen and diagnose <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> component <b>of</b> FAS for all patients evaluated in <b>the</b> network <b>of</b> clinics (1, 500 to date). The 4 -Digit Code is a comprehensive diagnostic system developed by the FAS DPN in 1997 to diagnose <b>the</b> full spectrum <b>of</b> outcomes among patients with prenatal alcohol exposure. The four digits reflect <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four key diagnostic features <b>of</b> FAS in <b>the</b> following order: 1) growth deficiency, 2) <b>the</b> FAS <b>facial</b> phenotype, 3) brain dysfunction, and 4) gestational alcohol exposure.

Prior to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4 -Digit Code, the first 445 patients evaluated in the FAS DPN were diagnosed using the gestalt method. For research purposes, their gestalt diagnoses were transformed into 4 -Digit Diagnostic Codes, presenting a unique opportunity to directly compare the two diagnostic methods.

25|$|Bell's palsy is {{the most}} common cause of one sided facial nerve {{paralysis}} (70%). It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year. About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life. It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60. Males and females are affected equally. It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774–1842), who first described the connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> nerve to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Around 9% of {{patients}} {{have some sort}} of sequelae after Bell's palsy, typically the synkinesis already discussed, or spasm, contracture, tinnitus and/or hearing loss during facial movement or crocodile tear syndrome. This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or Bogorad's Syndrome and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating. This is thought to be due to faulty regeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> nerve, a branch of which controls the lacrimal and salivary glands. Gustatorial sweating can also occur.|$|E
25|$|Since synkinesis {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients within 1–2 months, the nuclear hyper-excitability hypothesis is being supported by more researchers. Furthermore, axonal regeneration is a slow process (~1mm/day growth) and regeneration at this rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> nerve would roughly take 4–8 months. Since synkinesis is observed much earlier, aberrant regeneration and ephaptic communication fail to explain for this observation thus providing evidence that nuclear hyper-excitability {{is an important factor in}} the mechanism of synkinesis development.|$|E
