50|$|The cost of {{cleaning}} up after a crisis can be huge. In systemically important banking crises in the world from 1970 to 2007, the average net recapitalization cost to the government was 6% of GDP, fiscal costs associated with crisis management averaged 13% of GDP (16% of GDP if expense recoveries are ignored), and economic <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> averaged about 20% of GDP during {{the first four years}} of the crisis.|$|E
5000|$|For example, [...] "normal" [...] fouling at a {{conventionally}} fired 500 MW (net electrical power) {{power station}} unit accounts for <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> of the steam turbine of 5 MW and more. In a 1,300 MW nuclear power station, typical losses could be 20 MW and up (up to 100% if the station shuts down due to fouling-induced component degradation). In seawater desalination plants, fouling may reduce the gained output ratio by two-digit percentages (the gained output ratio is an equivalent that puts the mass of generated distillate {{in relation to the}} steam used in the process). The extra electrical consumption in compressor-operated coolers is also easily in the two-digit area. In addition to the operational costs, also the capital cost increases because the heat exchangers have to be designed in larger sizes to compensate for the heat-transfer loss due to fouling. To the <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> listed above, one needs to add the cost of down-time required to inspect, clean, and repair the components (millions of dollars per day of shutdown in lost revenue in a typical power plant), and the cost of actually doing this maintenance. Finally, fouling is often a root cause of serious degradation problems that may limit the life of components or entire plants.|$|E

A recent laboratory experimental study also shows that, compared to financial markets, real estate markets involve longer boom and bust periods.

50|$|In {{these two}} earlier {{versions}} of original sin hypothesis, Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza argued that {{in the presence of}} high levels of original sin, domestic investments will have a currency mismatch (projects that generate domestic currency will be financed with a foreign currency) so that macroeconomic and financial instability will be unavoidable. Hence, original sin and currency mismatch are used interchangeable in these early studies. Goldstein and Turner (2003) criticized this by showing that large <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> due to the currency mismatches during financial crises could not be attributed to original sin. Hence, they claimed that the original sin is not a sufficient condition for a currency mismatch.|$|E
50|$|Systemic banking crises are {{associated}} with substantial fiscal costs and large <b>output</b> <b>losses.</b> Frequently, emergency liquidity support and blanket guarantees {{have been used to}} contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy.|$|E
50|$|Modern large wind {{turbines}} are typically actively controlled {{to face the}} wind direction measured by a wind vane situated {{on the back of}} the nacelle. By minimizing the yaw angle (the misalignment between wind and turbine pointing direction), the power output is maximized and non-symmetrical loads minimized. However, since the wind direction varies quickly the turbine will not strictly follow the direction and will have a small yaw angle on average. The power <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> can simply be approximated to fall with (cos(yaw angle))3. Particularly at low-to-medium wind speeds, yawing can make a significant reduction in turbine output, with wind direction variations of ±30° being quite common and long response times of the turbines to changes in wind direction. At high wind speeds, the wind direction is less variable.|$|E

If expenditure constrains are present and binding, unconstrained profit-maximization is not valid for modelling producers' input use decisions. In this paper we apply the indirect production function approach which describes output maximization subject to a given technology, a set of quasi-fixed inputs and a given {{budget for the}} purchase of variable inputs. By employing the indirect production function in the stochastic frontier framework we can estimate producer's <b>output</b> <b>loss</b> due to both expenditure constraints and technical inefficiency. Our estimation results show that most of the study farms were expenditure constrained during the considered period.

50|$|A {{firm with}} {{monopoly}} power sets a monopoly price that maximizes the Monopoly profit. The most profitable {{price for the}} monopoly occurs when output level ensures the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal revenue (MR)) associated with the demand curve. Under normal market conditions for a monopolist, this monopoly price will be higher than the Marginal (Economic) cost of producing the product, thereby indicating the price paid by the consumer, which {{is equal to the}} marginal benefit for the consumer, is above the firm's marginal cost. In the chart below the shaded area represents the profits of the monopolist, such that MR = MC for the case of monopoly.

50|$|Criticism on {{the concept}} of {{original}} sin has been twofold. On the one hand, Morris Goldstein and Philip Turner claim that original sin is not a sufficient condition for a currency mismatch, and thus cannot account for the large <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> due to the currency mismatches during financial crises. On the other hand, Carmen Reinhart, Kenneth Rogoff and Miguel Savastano claim that the main problem of emerging market economies is to learn how to borrow less rather than learn how to borrow more in their domestic currency. They assumed that the problems of emerging markets were not due to original sin, but to so-called debt intolerance: the inability of emerging markets to manage levels of external debt that, under the same circumstances, would be manageable for developed countries. Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza respond to both criticisms in a paper elaborating the difference between currency mismatches, debt intolerance and original sin.|$|E

This measure of the <b>output</b> <b>loss</b> associated with a recession can take unexpected twists and turns as the recovery unfolds.

5000|$|A banking panic or {{bank panic}} is a {{financial}} crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or {{try to get out}} of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out. The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down. [...] According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System, and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs. The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic <b>output</b> <b>losses</b> averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.|$|E

The Nordisk films remain little seen outside Denmark. In 1999, MOMA, and later the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, held the first retrospective screening of Christensen's work under the rubric Benjamin Christensen: An International Dane. Of Christensen, Carl Theodor Dreyer once described him as [...] "a man who knew exactly what he wanted and who pursued his goal with uncompromising stubbornness."

To analyze this question, we present a model that defines currency crises as situations in which the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange rate exceed the costs of abandonment. The results show that a higher exposure to interest rate changes increases the probability of crisis through an increased need for <b>output</b> <b>loss</b> compensation and an increased efficacy of monetary policy in stimulating output. A higher exposure to exchange rate changes also increases the need for <b>output</b> <b>loss</b> compensation.
