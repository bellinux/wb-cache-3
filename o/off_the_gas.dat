25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E
25|$|Carl Froch lost in {{the final}} of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in a {{dramatic}} bout against undefeated WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward. The vacant The Ring super-middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super-middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward seemed to take his foot <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas,</b> leaving Froch to win a couple of rounds {{near the end of the}} fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant The Ring super-middleweight title and is also regarded as becoming Lineal champion with his Super Six World Boxing Classic win against Froch, despite some independent sources rating undefeated IBF title holder Lucian Bute #1 or 2. The fight peaked at 580,000 viewers on Showtime.|$|E

500|$|An {{obsession}} is an [...] "undesired, unpleasant, intrusive {{thought that}} cannot be suppressed through the patient's volition", but unlike passivity experiences described above, {{they are not}} experienced as imposed from outside the patient's mind. Obsessions are typically intrusive thoughts of violence, injury, dirt or sex, or obsessive ruminations on intellectual themes. A person can also describe obsessional doubt, with intrusive worries about whether they have made the wrong decision, or forgotten to do something, for example turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> or lock the house. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the individual experiences obsessions with or without compulsions (a sense of having to carry out certain ritualized and senseless actions against their wishes).|$|E
500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and letting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time". Likewise, Nutter called the controls [...] "initially tricky... but incredibly playable," [...] Next Generation stated [...] "the proper techniques, with time, can be learned," [...] and John concluded [...] "once you get used to it, you'll find a real solid game". The latter reviewer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. Dan Elektro agreed that the controls were [...] "responsive", but [...] "to a fault": [...] "At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line".|$|E

[...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones stated that [...] "the episode came together nicely in the end, with an expected twist and a snog, although for a great part it bordered on tedium. [...] Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain one's attention over a flashback. [...] She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. [...] There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack." [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a [...] "C+"; however, he wrote that [...] "the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell [...] was [...] "not impressed with Jack and Juliet's chemistry" [...] and found their kiss [...] "unconvincing". [...] Martell commended Emerson's acting, Ben's one-liners and his [...] "too funny for words" [...] casual greeting to Hurley and Sawyer {{at the end of the}} episode after he is released from captivity. [...] The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought that [...] "this was another great episode [...] could have lived up to last week's episode, but there was still a lot of solid character development." ...|$|E

[...] Garner explained the move in his 2011 autobiography The Garner Files: [...] "When you are going straight in reverse about 35 miles an hour, you come <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> pedal, go hard left, and pull on the emergency brake.

500|$|Neon (Greek [...] (néon), neuter {{singular}} form of νέος meaning [...] "new"), {{was discovered}} in 1898 by the British chemists Sir William Ramsay (1852–1916) and Morris W.

Neon was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> as they boiled <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> nitrogen, oxygen, and argon had been identified, but <b>the</b> remaining <b>gases</b> were isolated in roughly their order of abundance, in a six-week period beginning {{at the end of}} May 1898. First to be identified was krypton. The next, after krypton had been removed, was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge. This gas, identified in June, was named neon, the Greek analogue of [...] "novum", (new), suggested by Ramsay's son. The characteristic brilliant red-orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately; Travers later wrote, [...] "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget." ...|$|R
