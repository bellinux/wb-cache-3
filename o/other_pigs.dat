60|$|The Irishman had {{observed}} that the wild pigs were particularly fond of a certain root which was plentiful in a valley about three miles distant from the hut. Repairing to that valley, he dug {{up one of the}} roots, baited his hook with it, hung it from a low branch to attract attention, fastened {{the other end of the}} line to a tree, and went off to hide and bide his time. Before half-an-hour had elapsed, a gay young pig visited the scene of its former festivities, saw the pendent bait, smelt it, took it in its mouth, and straightway filled the woods with frantic lamentations. The struggle between the Irishman and that pig was worthy of record, but we prefer leaving it to the reader's imagination. The upshot was, that the pig was overcome, carried--bound, and shrieking--to the hut, and tamed by Peggy. In a short time, <b>other</b> <b>pigs</b> were caught and tamed. So, also, were rabbits. These bred and multiplied. The original pig became the mother of a large family, and in a short time something like the sounds and aspects of a farm began to surround the old hut. Still further--by means of the cast-iron pot, which already boiled their soup and their soap--they managed to boil sea-water down into salt, and with this some of the pigs were converted into salt pork--in short, the place began to assume the appearance of a busy and thriving backwoods settlement.|$|E
60|$|Our enclosure, round {{which this}} {{composite}} of degradations wandered, was of some extent. In one corner was a trellis {{with a long}} table of rough boards. Here the Fourth of July feast had been held not long before with memorable consequences, yet to be set forth; here we took our meals; here entertained to a dinner the king and notables of Makin. In the midst was the house, with a verandah front and back, and three is rooms within. In the verandah we slung our man-of-war hammocks, worked there by day, and slept at night. Within were beds, chairs, a round table, a fine hanging lamp, and portraits {{of the royal family}} of Hawaii. Queen Victoria proves nothing; Kalakaua and Mrs. Bishop are diagnostic; and the truth is we were the stealthy tenants of the parsonage. On the day of our arrival Maka was away; faithless trustees unlocked his doors; and the dear rigorous man, the sworn foe of liquor and tobacco, returned to find his verandah littered with cigarettes and his parlour horrible with bottles. He made but one condition--on the round table, which he used in the celebration of the sacraments, he begged us to refrain from setting liquor; in all else he bowed to the accomplished fact, refused rent, retired across the way into a native house, and, plying in his boat, beat the remotest quarters of the isle for provender. He found us pigs- -I could not fancy where--no <b>other</b> <b>pigs</b> were visible; he brought us fowls and taro; when we gave our feast to the monarch and gentry, it was he who supplied the wherewithal, he who superintended the cooking, he who asked grace at table, and when the king's health was proposed, he also started the cheering with an English hip-hip- hip. There was never a more fortunate conception; the heart of the fatted king exulted in his bosom at the sound.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have already}} seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet; but some {{additional}} instances may be given. In the Polynesian Islands and in China the dog is fed exclusively on vegetable matter, and the taste {{for this kind of}} food is to a certain extent inherited. (24/34. Gilbert White 'Nat. Hist. Selborne' 1825 volume 2 page 121.) Our sporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds, whilst most other dogs devour them with greediness. In {{some parts of the world}} sheep have been largely fed on fish. The domestic hog is fond of barley, the wild boar is said to disdain it; and the disdain is partially inherited, for some young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this grain, whilst others of the same brood relished it. (24/35. Burdach 'Traite de Phys.' tome 2 page 267 as quoted by Dr. P. Lucas 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 1 page 388.) One of my relations bred some young pigs from a Chinese sow by a wild Alpine boar; they lived free in the park, and were so tame that they came to the house to be fed; but they would not touch swill, which was devoured by the <b>other</b> <b>pigs.</b> An animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet, which can generally be effected only during youth, dislikes its proper food, as Spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been long fed on meat. Individuals of the same species take to new food with different degrees of readiness; one horse, it is stated, soon learned to eat meat, whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than have partaken of it. (24/36. This and several other cases are given by Colin 'Physiologie Comp. des Animaux Dom.' 1854 tome 1 page 426.) The caterpillars of the Bombyx hesperus feed in a state of nature on the leaves of the Cafe diable, but, after having been reared on the Ailanthus, they would not touch the Cafe diable, and actually died of hunger.

40|$|Data from {{attendees}} of {{the annual}} World Pork Expo spanning the five-year period 1991 - 1995 were analyzed to determine the relationships between pork production and worker health. Self-reported or subjective health problems suggest that pork production is associated with nagging types of chronic problems for the producer and the family. Farmers {{were significantly more likely}} than non-farmers to report chronic health problems of cough/phlegm and flu-type symptoms. Pig farmers were significantly more likely than other farmers to report cough/phlegm, sinus problems, sore throat, and family being affected. Confinement farmers {{were more likely to report}} or observe effects and family member effects than were <b>other</b> <b>pig</b> farmers. Objective lung measurements did not show any significant differences in lung capacity. The lack of objective evidence is not compelling enough to conclude that the self-reported health effects do not exist, because the data 2 ̆ 7 s time frame may not be sufficient to reveal permanent respiratory damage. Farmers were less likely to report hearing problems than were non-farmers. Pig farmers and confinement farmers were no different in this area than other farmers. However, hearing measurements showed that farmers had significantly impaired (reduced) hearing in both ears as compared to nonfarmers. Hearing problems for confinement farmers and <b>other</b> <b>pig</b> farmers were not significantly different from other farmers. Farmers also had significantly lower hand strength than non-farmers, and pig farmers had less hand strength than <b>other</b> farmers. <b>Pig</b> farmers may be more susceptible to hand injury or repetitive motion disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome...|$|R

"`I {{was away}} in the dissert somewheres,' he is wont to say, `I don't rightly remimber where, for my brain's no better than a sive at geagraphy, {{but it was a}} wild place, anyhow--bad luck to it! Well, we had sot up a line o' {{telegraph}} in it, an' wan the posts was stuck in the ground not far from a pool o' wather where the wild bastes was used to dhrink of a night, an' they tuk a mighty likin' to this post, which they scrubbed an' scraped at till they broke it agin an' agin. Och! it's me heart was broke intirely wi' them. At last I putt me brains in steep an' got up an invintion. It wouldn't be aisy to explain it, specially to onscientific people. No matter, it was an electrical arrangement, which I fixed to the post, an' bein' curious to know how it would work, I wint down to the pool an' hid mesilf in a hole of a rock, wid a big stone over me an ferns all round about. I tuk me rifle, av coorse, just for company, you know, but not to shoot, for I'm not bloodthirsty, by no means. Well, I hadn't bin long down whin a rustle in the laves towld me that somethin' was comin', an' sure enough down trotted a little deer-- as purty a thing as you could wish to see. It took a dhrink, tremblin' all the time, an' there was good cause, for another rustlin' was heard. Off wint the deer, just as a panther o' some sort jumped out o' the jungle an' followed it. Bad luck go wid ye says I; but I'd scarce said it whin a loud crashing in the jungle towld me a buffalo or an elephant was comin'. It was an elephant. He wint an' took a long pull at the pool. After that he goes straight to the post. Ha! says I, it's an owld friend o' yours, I see. When he putt his great side agin' it, for the purpose of scratchin', he got a shock from my electrical contrivance that caused his tail to stand upon end, and the hairs at its point to quiver. Wid a grunt he stood back an' gave the post a look o' surprise, as much as to say, Did ye do that a-purpose, ye spalpeen? Then he tried it again, an' got another shock that sot up his dander, for he twisted his long nose round the post, goin' to pull it down, no doubt, but he got another shock on the nose that made him squeal an' draw back. Then he lowered his great head for a charge. It's all over wid ye now, me post, says I; but the baste changed its mind, and wint off wid its tail an' trunk in the air, trumpetin' as if it had got the toothache. Well, after that nothin' came for some time, and I think I must have gone off to slape, for I was awoke by a most tremendious roar. Lookin' up I saw a tiger sprawlin' on his back beside the post! Av coorse the shock wasn't enough to have knocked the baste over. I suppose it had tripped in the surprise. Anyhow it jumped up and seized the post with claws an' teeth, whin av coorse it got another shock that caused it to jump back about six yards, with its tail curled, its hair all on end, all its claws out, an' its eyes blazin'. You seem to feel it, says I--into meself, for fear he'd hear me. He didn't try it again, but wint away into the bush like a war-rocket. After that, five or six little wild pigs came down, an' the smallest wan wint straight up to the post an' putt his nose to it. He drew back wid a jerk, an' gave a scream that seemed to rend all his vitals. You don't like it, thinks I; but, faix, it looked as if I was wrong, for he tried it again. Another shock he got, burst himself a'most wid a most fearful yell, an' bolted. His brothers didn't seem to understand it quite. They looked after him in surprise. Then the biggest wan gave a wriggle of his curly tail, an' wint to the post as if to inquire what was the matter. When he got it on the nose the effect was surprisin'. The curl of his tail came straight out, an' it quivered for a minute all over, wid its mouth wide open. The screech had stuck in his throat, but it came out at last so fierce that the <b>other</b> <b>pigs</b> had to join in self-defence. I stuck my fingers in my ears and shut me eyes. When I opened them again the pigs were gone. It's my opinion they were all dissolved, like the zinc plates in a used-up battery; but I can't prove that. Well, while I was cogitatin' on the result of my little invintion, what should walk out o' the woods but a man! At first I tuk him for a big monkey, for the light wasn't very good, but he had a gun on his shoulder, an' some bits o' clothes on, so I knew him for a human. Like the rest o' them, he wint up to the post an' looked at it, but didn't touch it. Then he came to the pool an' tuk a dhrink, an' spread out his blanket, an' began to arrange matters for spendin' the rest o' the night there. Av coorse he pulled out his axe, for he couldn't do widout fire to kape the wild bastes off. An' what does he do but go straight up to my post an' lift his axe for a good cut. Hallo! says I, pretty loud, for I was a'most too late. Whew! What a jump he gave--six futt if it was an inch. Whin he came down he staggered with his back agin the post. That was enough. The jump he tuk before was nothin' to what he did after. I all but lost sight of him among the branches. When he returned to the ground it was flat on his face he fell, an', rowlin' over his head, came up on his knees with a roar that putt the tigers and pigs to shame. Sarves you right, says I, steppin' out of my hole. Av coorse he thought I was a divil of some sort, for he turned as white in the face as a brown man could, an' bolted without so much as sayin' farewell. The way that nigger laid his legs along the ground was a caution. Ostriches are a joke to it. I picked up his blanket an' fetched it home as a keepsake, an' from that day to this the telegraph-posts have been held sacred by man an' baste all over that part of the country.'" ...|$|E
