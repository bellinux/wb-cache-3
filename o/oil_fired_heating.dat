50|$|The estate {{included}} a primary school at its south eastern end {{along with a}} nursery at deck level within the complex of flatted buildings. As discussed, the estate was served by a communal, <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> <b>heating</b> system and was served by landscaped open spaces located in amongst the buildings. The estate {{was connected to the}} nearby shopping complex, but was not otherwise served by local shops, which could be problematic for the estate's inhabitants as Shopping City would close in the evenings and on Sundays. The estate was served by a public house. Construction had commenced on a church but this was never completed.|$|E
50|$|Biomass {{is widely}} used as a fuel in {{electricity}} production, CHP plants and district heating, often mixed with other fuels, especially peat. In fact, Finland is among the world leaders {{in the use of}} CHP. Both renewable and fossil fuels are used. The world’s largest bio power plant with a capacity of 265 MW is situated in Pietarsaari in Finland. Wood is also used directly for heating. In total around 6 million m3 or 50 PJ of firewood are used annually for space heating. There are also dedicated boilers that burn wood chips or pellets. Fuel <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> <b>heating</b> can be converted to use pellets, which has been estimated to have a potential of 25 PJ/a.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the energy saving methods of <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> water <b>heating</b> in Hokkaido households, an actual condition investigation on conventional and latent heat recovery water heaters, was performed. The following results were obtained: 1) Latent heat recovery heaters heated water 10 - 12 % more efficiently than conventional heaters. 2) The water heating requests lasting under 30 seconds had little influence on the daily efficiency of hot water heaters. 3) As a result of case study, lowering the hot water heating temperature by 2. 0 degrees centigrade reduced energy use by 5. 9 %...|$|R
50|$|The present {{building}} (the {{chapel and}} large school room) {{dates back to}} 1869, when the site {{was used as the}} village school. The Methodists used the building for education and catered for around 140 children until 1907 when Leicestershire County Council leased the school rooms as a 'public elementary school' instead. Nowadays, the present day primary school still use the building for whole school assemblies. The Church is now regularly used for Sunday worships, baptisms, weddings, funerals and carol services. Currently the community are attempting to improve the 'community atmosphere' by improving the Methodist Church. Their mission is to 'create an accessible entrance, foyer, kitchen with lounge and to restructure the toilet facilities within the existing 'Schoolroom' area. The whole area is to be independently heated rather than use the <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> central <b>heating</b> system, improving their energy efficiency'.|$|R
50|$|The Depression profoundly {{impacted}} {{education in}} Poughkeepsie. Although in 1930, the district {{went ahead with}} a commitment to provide “modern” instructional aids by purchasing four “moving picture” machines for $700 and spending $1,000 on a district-wide film library, by 1932, all employees were taking salary cuts to cover school costs. An enrollment decline was also noted that year: elementary enrollment increased by only 72 students {{in comparison with the}} normal annual increase of 275 children. It was during the Depression that interest in student health services first increased; speech programs were started, feet were examined, glasses bought for those who could not afford them, a dental hygiene program was begun and physical education was given prominent consideration. Students were required to show proof of small pox vaccinations. Law mandated fire inspections and <b>fire</b> drills. School <b>heating</b> plants were changed from coal burning to <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> <b>heat.</b> It was noted that “undernourished children” were observed in the schools and funds were set aside to provide limited school feeding programs. High unemployment led to the State’s raising the compulsory age for school attendance to sixteen, a move that created even greater overcrowding {{at the high school level}} and the need for high school programs that better responded to a range of student interests and abilities.By 1936, the economic picture had improved somewhat. Discussion began in earnest about the need for more instructional space at the high school level. Plans were initially developed to build an addition onto the North Hamilton Street High School, but the State Education Department rejected the proposal for an addition, claiming that the site offered insufficient space. Noting that he was opposed to seeing the children of Poughkeepsie “constrained on the North Hamilton Street site for the next 50 years”, a representative from the State Education Department recommended that a new “modern” high school, similar to the recently completed Arlington High School, be built on Forbus Street, with Memorial Field as its grounds. Two bond issues to build on that site; one for a new, comprehensive high school and the other for a supplemental vocational school, which could be funded in part by a federal Public Works Assistance matching grant (similar to the ones being used to build the Post Office, the Journal building and the Violet Avenue School in Hyde Park) were defeated by the voters.|$|R
40|$|As plant {{modelling}} becomes {{capable of}} more complexity and detailed resolution, new opportunities arise for the virtual evaluation of discrete plant components such as flow control and energy conversion devices, and controllers. Such objects are conventionally developed and tested at the prototype {{stage in a}} laboratory environment. Designers now seek to use modelling technology to extend their understanding from limited laboratory test results to full building and plant system analysis. This paper describes {{the development of a}} modelling system, using ESP-r, for typical United Kingdom domestic house types with hydronic gas or <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> central <b>heating</b> including radiator and underfloor heating systems, and with a variety of conventional or advanced control types. It demonstrates the ability of detailed building and plant modelling to reveal unexpected insights into how real control systems perform in combination with other plant items and in different building types, including estimation of their influence on annual energy consumption. Comparisons with measurements taken in test rooms confirm that the observed behaviour of controls is realised in practice. The authors conclude that the complex dynamic interactions that take place between the various elements that make up a real building energy system have an important influence on its overall energy performance, revealing causes of variance that cannot be identified by laboratory testing alone, or by simplistic energy assessment tools...|$|R

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, <b>oil</b> <b>fires</b> must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|R
