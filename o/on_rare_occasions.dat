5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{both male and}} female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> German surface {{ships were}} able to reach Japan as well. These {{included}} auxiliary cruisers Michel and Thor, which were brought to Yokohama after the Kriegsmarine chiefs realized in the late 1942 {{that it would not}} practical for them to return to Germany-controlled European ports.|$|E

5|$|While waterspouts form {{mostly in}} the tropics and {{subtropical}} areas, other areas also report waterspouts, including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes, Antarctica and <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> the Great Salt Lake. Although rare, waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake-effect snow precipitation bands.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on the wood of dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E

50|$|Quality: it's {{not a true}} barreling, Indonesian-style wave, in {{comparison}} to other, more famous waves in Indonesia. Usually a long wall, but can barrel <b>on</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>occasions,</b> especially <b>on</b> lower tides.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> the reverse will occur. It {{should also be noted}} that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> mourning doves {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{snowfall}} {{can occur}} near large inland bays, {{where it is}} known as bay-effect snow. Bay-effect snows fall downwind of Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and Massachusetts Bay when the basic criteria are met, and <b>on</b> <b>rarer</b> <b>occasions</b> along Long Island.|$|R
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the western Atlantic Ocean, from Chesapeake Bay southward through the Florida Keys, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles; <b>on</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> it is found as far north as New Jersey and Massachusetts, as far south as Venezuela, and as far west as Mexico. It is absent from the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean coast of Central America. Reports of this species from off Brazil and Argentina likely represent misidentifications of the groovebelly stingray (D.hypostigma).|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} {{is found}} throughout the inshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico (where {{it is the only}} representative of its family) and the Caribbean Sea, including Florida, the Bahamas, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles to Trinidad. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> it ranges as far north as Cape Lookout in North Carolina. It is quite abundant in the Florida Keys and parts of the Antilles, and rather uncommon elsewhere. Off Mexico, this species occupies a salinity range of 26–40ppt.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. <b>On</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
