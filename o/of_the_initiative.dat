5|$|New Formulation {{reviewer}} Michael Glavin cited Newman's ignorance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> of anarchists to decentralize {{power and}} of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and affinity groups {{as evidence that}} he failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with domination.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Initiative</b> tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> to {{challenge}} {{the constitutionality of the}} Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed Swine Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market.

As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E
5|$|The Dennis {{decision}} {{paved the}} way for the prosecution of hundreds of other Communist party members. The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield was {{a popular}} Governor who {{supported}} Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the postwar era expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative,</b> he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center {{in what is now}} the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative,</b> Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This was the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not {{in compliance with the}} 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, {{was one of the last}} holdouts for school desegregation.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
30|$|One {{critical}} feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DAT {{is that it}} {{was composed}} of department members, in this case five faculty. While the SITAR team worked with them, offering suggestions and guidance, it was ultimately the DAT who chose what course of action to pursue. Thus, agency and ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> were squarely theirs. It was the DAT faculty members who settled on curricular coherence as a common goal worth pursuing, and this personal interest in <b>the</b> outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> motivated their continued efforts. This internal ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change <b>initiative</b> is aligned with the people frame.|$|R

5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets. The hope is to bring more businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. This phase {{of the project was}} expected to be completed by 2016. The other part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a revitalization plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.|$|E
5|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{capitulation}} of Tsarist Russia the Germans, having moved {{the bulk of}} their forces to the Western Front, launched the Spring Offensive, striking against the British forces in the Somme. The initial onslaught pushed the Allied forces back and the Australian divisions, which had been merged into the Australian Corps, were thrown into the line in an effort to stem the tide. In early March, the 11th Battalion moved to the Hollebeke sector, where they were subjected to gas attacks before being sent south to Amiens at the start of April, joining the rest of the 1st Division in defence of Hazebrouck {{in the middle of the}} month. For the next couple of months the battalion rotated through the line in a defensive role as the German offensive was blunted. In June, as the Allies sought to regain some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative,</b> they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration raids. On 2 June, the 11th Battalion attacked Mont de Merris, which resulted in the capture of a large amount of German equipment and over 200 prisoners for the loss of 16 men killed and 74 wounded. A lesser attack was launched on the German trenches opposite the battalion on 22 June. Around this time, a small group of US soldiers was attached to the 11th Battalion to gain experience. The following month, the battalion captured Gerbedoen Farm before supporting the 10th Battalion's successful attack on Merris.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initiative,</b> a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E
