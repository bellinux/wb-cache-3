500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E
