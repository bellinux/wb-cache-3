5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E

It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes.

5|$|The {{cane toad}} has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its {{voracious}} appetite, the cane toad {{has been introduced}} to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E

One area <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> was the region of Maryland south of the Anacostia River.

5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E

For example in Kenya, two World Food Program of the United Nation purchased maize samples were confiscated and destroyed {{because of the}} lack of acceptable levels of aflatoxins in the purchased crops (Hassan et al. 1998). This is <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concerns</b> to smallholder farmers as aflatoxins toxicity primarily emerge out where there is high moisture content and high temperatures which is supported by inadequate storage structures. The place visited in this study fulfils all of these criteria and was confirmed by our study that aflatoxins contamination is serious challenge to smallholder farmers especially in this part of country.|$|R

5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> is {{the damage done}} to honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health.

5|$|Main Roads Western Australia {{monitors}} {{traffic volume}} across the state's road network, including various locations along Great Eastern Highway. In 2008/09, the busiest section was {{east of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway interchange, averaging 60,760 vehicles per weekday. The lowest volume was an average of 850 vehicles per day near Ryans Find Road, partway between Southern Cross and Coolgardie; however, this point also received the largest proportion of heavy vehicles, at 40.2% of all traffic. , Great Eastern Highway between Mundaring and Northam is the state's worst section of National Highway, in terms of road safety. Casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007, although the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities. In 2013, Great Eastern Highway remained as a road <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern,</b> with the Australian Automobile Association giving 67% of the highway a low one- or two-star rating (out of five), and 77% of the route between The Lakes and Northam a one-star safety rating.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>concern</b> as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
