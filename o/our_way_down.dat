60|$|Before {{we reached}} Seathwaite in Borrowdale, a few stars had appeared, and we pursued <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Vale, to Rosthwaite, by moonlight.|$|E

6000|$|On Ponkawtasset, since, we took <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> [...] <b>Down</b> {{this still}} stream to far Billericay, [...] A poet wise has settled, whose fine ray [...] Doth often shine on Concord's {{twilight}} day.|$|R
60|$|We saw at a {{distance}} several huts or houses of the mountaineer inhabitants, but went near none of them, but kept on <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> going <b>down</b> two or three pretty steep places, not at all dangerous, though something difficult.|$|R
60|$|We made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{steadily}} <b>down</b> {{the rim of}} {{the beautiful}} river which flows the length of the island, coming at last to a wood rather denser than any that I had be-fore encountered in this country. Well within this forest my escort halted.|$|R
60|$|We made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} garden, which they searched last. At the creek's side {{the boat was}} gone, and there were {{footsteps}} in the mud.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good indeed. As soon as {{she gets}} strong enough to travel we will begin to think how we can best make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's what {{it amounts}} to," [...] persisted the Waters. [...] "We see {{a good deal}} of the minor graces of life on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to our job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cut our brides out,' {{said the}} colonel, 'and then cut <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> without going <b>down</b> a single turning, bang to the Spanish main!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut our Brides out," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "and then cut <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> without going <b>down</b> a single turning, Bang to the Spanish Main!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After what Weston {{has told}} us, boys, {{you want to}} get hold of the {{significance}} of that. People have been selling <b>our</b> stock <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> on the notion that before they had to deliver they could cover at a still lower figure. Now, they can't buy it. We're going to smash them flat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{not think}} we might crawl out between the wheel and the wall, and make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tail race, Master Rupert? This water is {{chilling}} me to the bones." ...|$|E
6000|$|At noon, {{the rain}} slacking a little, we {{determined}} to pack up, {{and with such}} cheer as we could called out, [...] "Line up, boys--line up!" [...] starting on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the trail.|$|E
60|$|He {{addressed}} his ball, {{and drove}} a beauty over the trees. It flashed {{out of sight}} {{in the direction of the}} seventeenth tee. Arthur and I made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the hill to play our second.|$|E
60|$|When we had {{kissed the}} little girl good night, we started at once to rejoin <b>our</b> friends. Half <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the hall we met Mrs. Sanderson and her son coming to us.|$|R
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>way</b> was <b>down</b> the Nollichucky, {{past the}} great bend of it below Lick Creek, {{and so to}} the Great War-path, the trail by which countless parties of red marauders had {{travelled}} north and south. It led, indeed, northeast between the mountain ranges. Although we kept a watch by day and night, we saw no sign of Dragging Canoe or his men, and at length we forded the Holston {{and came to the}} scattered settlement in Carter's Valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is our road," [...] Dick exclaimed. [...] "That {{clump of}} houses, Surajah, {{must be the}} one where we {{generally}} turned. I know that, from below, these rocks looked as steep as walls, {{so there is no}} chance of <b>our</b> finding a <b>way</b> <b>down</b> anywhere, between this and the fort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{we could}} not go in that direction," [...] the countess agreed; [...] "but I have thought often, Magdalene, that we may {{possibly}} make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Ostend. Things are much quieter on that line." ...|$|E
60|$|Gerard {{had already}} sprung from his horse, and was leading {{him through the}} bushes. I {{followed}} his example, and in {{a minute or two}} we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> a winding path into a deep chalk quarry.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the only plan will be to hide up {{for a couple of}} days, or so; then to make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> again to where the horses are, and then make a dash through Parton." ...|$|E
6000|$|This is all I know of Falmouth. Nothing {{occurred}} of note in <b>our</b> <b>way</b> [...] <b>down,</b> {{except that}} on Hartford Bridge we changed horses at an inn, [...] where the great----, Beckford, [2] sojourned for the night. We tried [...] {{in vain to}} see the martyr of prejudice, but could not. What we thought [...] singular, though you perhaps will not, was that Ld Courtney [3] [...] travelled the same night on the same road, only one stage behind him.|$|R
60|$|A mile of front {{trenches}} {{and then}} we are on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> that weary walk. Then I am whisked off upon a ten mile drive. There is a pause for lunch at Corps Headquarters, and after it we are taken to a medal presentation in a market square. Generals Munro, Haking and Landon, famous fighting soldiers all three, are the British representatives. Munro with a ruddy face, and brain above all bulldog below; Haking, pale, distinguished, intellectual; Landon a pleasant, genial country squire. An elderly French General stands beside them.|$|R
60|$|What {{with this}} noise {{on the part}} of Mr. Commissioner Pordage, and what with the cries of Sergeant Drooce on the raft astern (which were {{sometimes}} more than Tom Packer could silence), we often made <b>our</b> slow <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the river, anything but quietly. Yet, that it was of great importance that no ears should be able to hear us from the woods on the banks, could not be doubted. We were looked for, to a certainty, and we might be retaken at any moment. It was an anxious time; it was, indeed, indeed, an anxious time.|$|R
60|$|Together we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the precipitous {{slope and}} {{approached}} the body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} yet decided. We can go still farther south, into Texas, or make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> into Phoenix and across the prairies to Imperial Valley, or follow the Santa Fe route {{by way of the}} Grand Canyon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{there are}} places where we may lie hid," [...] Sihamba answered, [...] "and thence we can make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the {{seashore}} and so back homewards, whereas here upon the plain we {{can be seen from}} miles away." ...|$|E

60|$|We went on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up stairs {{after this}} episode; and, {{as we were}} going up, we met a gentleman groping his <b>way</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was so agreed; dispositions {{were made}} to {{surround}} Secundra at his task; some of Sir William's Indians hastened in advance; and a strong guard being left at our headquarters, we set forth along the uneven bottom of the forest; frost crackling, ice sometimes loudly splitting under foot; and overhead the blackness of pine-woods and the broken brightness of the moon. <b>Our</b> <b>way</b> led <b>down</b> into a hollow of the land; and as we descended, the sounds diminished and had almost died away. Upon the other slope it was more open, only dotted with a few pines, and several vast and scattered rocks that made inky shadows in the moonlight. Here the sounds began to reach us more distinctly; we could now perceive the ring of iron, and more exactly estimate the furious degree of haste with which the digger plied his instrument. As we neared {{the top of the}} ascent, a bird or two winged aloft and hovered darkly in the moonlight; and the next moment we were gazing through a fringe of trees upon a singular picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is just as}} I expected," [...] Egbert said; [...] "they {{have formed}} a boom across the river of trunks of trees and beams lashed together. We cannot make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> until that {{obstacle}} is removed. What say you Edmund?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} business!" [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed. [...] "We had better find our ponies and make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> into the valley at once. Seeing how thick the fog has come on, the Sardinians may not return here at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{as long as}} it is {{straight}} running, Sahib; but if they follow us far, they may come up within range of us as we are making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> some of those nasty places, where we came up the face of the ghaut." ...|$|E
60|$|Will it be credited? The monomaniac fell to rating {{me for my}} indiscretion! But {{the battle}} was over; these were her last guns, and more {{in the nature of}} a salute than of renewed hostilities. And {{presently}} she condescended on very moderate terms, and Rowley and I were able to escape in quest of supper. Much time had, however, been lost; the sun was long down, the lamps glimmered along the streets, and the voice of a watchman already resounded in the neighbouring Leith Road. On our first arrival I had observed a place of entertainment not far off, in a street behind the Register House. Thither we found <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> and sat <b>down</b> to a late dinner alone. But we had scarce given our orders before the door opened, and a tall young fellow entered with something of a lurch, looked about him, and approached the same table.|$|R
60|$|<b>Our</b> homeward <b>way</b> was <b>down</b> {{the hill}} and by the sea in the black open. We traversed a waste of {{shattered}} lava; spires, ravines, well-holes showing the entrance to vast subterranean vaults in whose profundities our horse-hooves doubtless echoed. The whole was clothed with stone fiorituri fantastically fashioned, like débris from the workshop of some brutal sculptor: dog's heads, devils, stone trees, and gargoyles broken in the making. From a distance, so intricate was the detail, {{the side of a}} hummock wore the appearance of some coarse and dingy sort of coral, or a scorched growth of heather. Amid this jumbled wreck, naked itself, and the evidence of old disaster, frequent plants found root: rose-apples bore their rosy flowers; and a bush between a cypress and a juniper attained at times a height of twenty feet.|$|R
60|$|March 18th.--To-day, {{it being}} very bright and mild, we set out, at noon, for an {{expedition}} to the Temple of Vesta, though I did not feel much inclined for walking, having been ill and feverish {{for two or three}} days past with a cold, which keeps renewing itself faster than I can get rid of it. We kept along on this side of the Corso, and crossed the Forum, skirting along the Capitoline Hill, and thence towards the Circus Maximus. On <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> looking <b>down</b> a cross street, we saw a heavy arch, and, on examination, made it out to be the Arch of Janus Quadrifrons, standing in the Forum Boarium. Its base is now considerably below the level of the surrounding soil, and there is a church or basilica close by, and some mean edifices looking down upon it. There is something satisfactory in this arch, from the immense solidity of its structure. It gives the idea, in the first place, of a solid mass constructed of huge blocks of marble, which time can never wear away, nor earthquakes shake down; and then this solid mass is penetrated by two arched passages, meeting in the centre. There are empty niches, three in a row, and, I think, two rows on each face; but there seems to have been very little effort to make it a beautiful object. On the top is some brickwork, the remains of a mediaeval fortress built by the Frangipanis, looking very frail and temporary being brought thus in contact with the antique strength of the arch.|$|R
