50|$|The {{bridge is}} built entirely of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel,</b> a newly {{developed}} material {{at the time}} of construction. The structure features a 790-foot main span and two additional 600-foot spans. Its 65-foot height above the water was the highest clearance of any U.S. bridge of that era. The construction of the piers went nearly 100 feet below the water's surface.|$|E
50|$|Several {{years later}} in 1897 Dr. Huston died leaving the company to his sons, Abram Francis Huston who became {{president}} of the company and Charles Lukens Huston who became works manager. By 1882 Charles Lukens Huston made it a part of his daily routine to go around the mill and meet all the employees and was proud to be able to greet them by name. He also performed sermons to the men and women that worked and wanted to listen. Sales offices began to open all over, including Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, New Orleans and New York City. Not long after the opening the mill became the largest producer of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> and steel plates on the Eastern side of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Park, Brother and Company of Pittsburgh, {{founded in}} 1860, {{was the second}} company to produce {{crucible}} steel in the U.S. James Park, Jr. and the elder David E. Park began the company after working with their father for twenty years. In 1857, James Jr. founded the Lake Superior Copper Works to sheath ship hulls. After encountering Hussey, Howe and Wells, he followed them into manufacturing crucible steel. Park built the Black Diamond (Park) Steel Works, and had interests in a suspension-bridge company and several banks. David's sons, David E. Jr., William G. and James H. Park, led in forming Crucible. In 1900, Park Steel was the largest producer of crucible and special-purpose <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steels</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|Wellman {{began his}} career working at the Nashua Iron Company. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to build a regenerative gas furnace for the company. Wellman did this, impressing Carl Wilhelm Siemens, who immediately hired him to establish the first crucible-steel furnace in America. Wellman went on to improve upon the <b>open-hearth</b> process of <b>steel</b> rail production, which in turn had improved upon the Bessemer process. In 1869, Wellman built the first commercially successful open-hearth furnace in America at the Bay State Iron Works in South Boston.|$|R
500|$|Gates {{was riding}} high with both Republic and Tennessee Coal and Iron doing well with more orders that both could fill. His {{assessment}} of the <b>open-hearth</b> process for <b>steel</b> production was confirmed by {{a report from the}} US Bureau of Corporations. [...] The report stated that an agent for U. S. Steel and a large railroad affiliated with J. P. Morgan pronounced the rails produced by the open-hearth process to be twice as good at those made by the Bessemer process, which was used by U. S. Steel. The report went on to praise Gates and his competitiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{developments}} {{took place}} after the Second World War, with an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> making facility being commissioned in 1949. The Glebe coke ovens were extended to their maximum number of 141 in 1953 and plans for No. 6 coke oven battery were formulated shortly after. These were to be built on old quarry workings {{to the north of}} the Open-Hearth building and enough land was levelled to accommodate a complete blast furnace plant as well as for the coke ovens by-products plant and gasholder. No. 6 battery of 51 ovens was commissioned in 1961; however, after the footings were installed for the blast furnace, the rest of the construction was put [...] "temporarily on hold", and work was never continued.|$|E
5000|$|The Bessemer process {{revolutionized}} steel manufacture by decreasing its cost, from £40 per {{long ton}} to £6-7 per long ton, along with greatly increasing {{the scale and}} speed of production of this vital raw material. The process also decreased the labor requirements for steel-making. Before it was introduced, steel was far too expensive to make bridges or the framework for buildings and thus wrought iron had been used throughout the Industrial Revolution. After {{the introduction of the}} Bessemer process, steel and wrought iron became similarly priced, and some users, primarily railroads, turned to steel. Quality problems, such as brittleness caused by nitrogen in the blowing air, prevented Bessemer steel from being used for many structural applications. [...] <b>Open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> was suitable for structural applications.|$|E
50|$|The Beaver Clay Mfg. Co. was {{incorporated}} in 1902, and its first plant was erected the same year. In that year, {{the company began}} manufacturing paving bricks. Shortly after the paving brick facilities were operational, the company made plans to manufacture face bricks. In 1915, the company made plans to improve its operations {{at a cost of}} over $100,000. Michael Baker was the lead engineer on the improvement project. The Beaver County clay company was awarded contracts with the U.S. government during World War I, which would help bolster its output to 30-36 million bricks in 1919. The company was purchased by the New Castle Refractories Company in 1935. The New Castle Refractories Co. purchase the plant in order to manufacture refractories for hot tops that were used in the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> industry.Eventually, the New Castle Refractories was absorbed by the Pittsburgh Refractories Company. Today, the property is occupied by E.J. Bognar, Inc., which is still in operation today.|$|E
5000|$|The factory {{was built}} on a 70 acre plot of land. The company {{originally}} was a manufacturer of agricultural implements. Its rapid growth was spurred by Bettendorf’s design of a one-piece railroad truck frame that eliminated bolts, which would work loose as the train was moving and cause delays or derailments. [...] The new frame was cast from {{a single piece of}} steel and revolutionized the railroad industry. [...] By 1909 the building had grown to three times its original size. It contained two regenerative <b>open-hearth</b> basic <b>steel</b> furnaces, with a capacity of 25 tons of heat. They were able to output about one hundred tons of finished steel castings daily that were used {{in the construction of the}} railroad boxcars. A complete railroad car was built from raw materials in the east end of the plant to the finished product on the west end. [...] The company expanded in the early 20th century to manufacture oil burners, toys, water pumps, ice crushers and other products. The company also built the Meteor automobile. [...] Between 1903 and 1910 the workforce grew from 300 to 800 employees.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' grain magnesite for the construction and maintenance of the hearths or bottoms of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> furnaces. Magnesia also is used in the form of calcined refractory magnesite brick and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids. All strong mineral acids dissolve or corrode magnesiu...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{reports by}} C. A. Pope III et. al. {{demonstrated}} {{that in the}} Utah Valley, closure of an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>steel</b> mill over the winter of 1987 was associated with reductions in respiratory disease and related hospital admissions in valley residents. To better {{examine the relationship between}} plant-associated changes in ambient particulate matter (PM) and respiratory health effects, we obtained total suspended particulate filters originally collected near the steel mill during the winter of 1986 (before closure), 1987 (during closure), and 1988 (after plant reopening). PM subcomponents were water-extracted from these filters and Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally instilled with equivalent masses of extract. Data indicated that 24 hr later, rats exposed to 1986 or 1988 extracts developed significant pulmonary injury and neutrophilic inflammation. Additionally, 50 % of rats exposed to 1986 or 1988 extracts had increased airway responsiveness to acetylcholine, compared to 17 and 25 % of rats exposed to saline or the 1987 extract, respectively. By 96 hr, these effects were largely resolved except for increases in lung lavage fluid neutrophils and lymphocytes in 1986 extract-exposed rats. Analogous effects were observed with lung histologic assessment. Extract analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy demonstrated in all three extracts nearly 70 % of the mass appeared to be sodium-based salts derived from the glass filter matrix. Interestingly, relative to the 1987 extract, the 1986 / 1988 extracts contained more sulfate, cationic salts (i. e., calcium, potassium, magnesium), and certain metals (i. e., copper, zinc, iron, lead, strontium, arsenic, manganese, nickel). Although total metal content was (3 / 4) 1 % of the extracts by mass, the greater quantity detected in the 1986 and 1988 extracts suggests metals may be important determinants of the pulmonary toxicity observed. In conclusion, the pulmonary effects induced by exposure of rats to water-based extracts of local ambient PM filters were in good accord with the cross-sectional epidemiologic reports of adverse respiratory health effects in Utah Valley residents...|$|E
