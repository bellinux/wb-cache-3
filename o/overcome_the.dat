5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{screening}} for novel anticancer compounds, B 1 [N-(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl) - 2 -aminothiazonaphthalimide], a novel amonafide analogue, was generated as a new anticancer candidate. In the present study, B 1 displayed stronger antitumor effects than amonafide in HL 60 cells. We further examined whether B 1 <b>overcomes</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2, as <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer. Our viability assay showed that B 1 <b>overcomes</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL 60 cells. Various apoptosis assessment assays showed that B 1 <b>overcomes</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 in HL 60 cells by inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, we elucidated the marked downregulation of 14 - 3 - 3 s protein by B 1, indicating that B 1 <b>overcomes</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2 inHL 60 cells via 14 - 3 - 3 s. The analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that MBD 2 {{was associated with the}} methylated 14 - 3 - 3 s promoter-associated CpG island and thus interfered with transcriptional activity of the methylated promoter. Furthermore, knockdown of MBD 2, using siRNA transfec-tion, inhibited B 1 -induced apoptosis and <b>overcame</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2. Accordingly, these data showed the involvement of MBD 2 in B 1 -induced apoptosis and <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> resistance conferred by Bcl- 2, which suggested that MBD 2 might guide the development of future anticancer agents.

The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E

To <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
