The measurement process and visualizations provided by set of certificated instruments: a digital oscillograph AKTAKOM ADS- 2221 MV, a digital generator АКТАКОМ AWG- 4150 (both with software) and a gauge RLC E 7 - 22. Comparative dynamic studies of fixed volume and weight pig’s blood, adipose tissue, muscular tissue impedance were conducted by contact versus contactless methods. Contactless method in contrast to contact method gives opportunity to obtain the real morphological visualization of biological tissue irrespective of their nature. Results. Comparison of contact and contactless methods of impedance measurement shows that the inductance to capacitance ratio X(L) / X(C) was equal: 17 – for muscular tissue, 4 – for blood, 1 – for adipose tissue. It demonstrates the technical correspondence of both impedance registration methods. If propose the base relevance of X (L) and X (C) parameters for biological tissue impedance so contactless measurement method for sure shows insulating properties of adipose tissue and high conductivity for blood and muscular tissue in fixed volume-weight parameters. Registration of biological tissue impedance complex parameters by contactless method with the help of induced ICM EMF in fixed volume of biological tissue uncovers the most important informative volumes to characterize morphofunctional condition of biological tissue namely X (L) / X (C).

Two mechanisms {{have been suggested}} to underlie these changes in oscillatory EEG activity: tACS-induced entrainment of brain oscillations and/or tACS-induced changes in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>circuits</b> by spike-timing dependent plasticity. Objective: We tested to what extent plasticity can account for tACS-aftereffects when controlling for entrainment “echoes. ” To this end, we used a novel, intermittent tACS protocol and investigated {{the strength of the}} aftereffect as a function of phase continuity between successive tACS episodes, as well as the match between stimulation frequency and endogenous α-frequency. Methods: 12 healthy participants were stimulated at around individual α-frequency for 15 – 20  min in four sessions using intermittent tACS or sham. Successive tACS events were either phase-continuous or phase-discontinuous, and either 3 or 8  s long. EEG α-phase and power changes were compared after and between episodes of α-tACS across conditions and against sham. Results: α-aftereffects were successfully replicated after intermittent stimulation using 8 -s but not 3 -s trains. These aftereffects did not reveal any of the characteristics of entrainment echoes in that they were independent of tACS phase-continuity and showed neither prolonged phase alignment nor frequency synchronization to the exact stimulation frequency. Conclusion: Our results indicate that plasticity mechanisms are sufficient to explain α-aftereffects in response to α-tACS, and inform models of tACS-induced plasticity in <b>oscillatory</b> <b>circuits.</b> Modifying brain oscillations with tACS holds promise for clinical applications in disorders involving abnormal neural synchrony...|$|R

Keywords gas sensor, conditioning circuit, {{surface acoustic wave}} 1. SAW TRANSDUCER AS A GAS SENSOR Systems with surface acoustic wave (SAW) have been applied in the construction of gas detectors for a long time [1 - 4]. The SAW gas sensors are composed of at least one acoustic delay line with a sensitive thin film layer on a top of the piezoelectric substrate and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDT) for excitation and detection of Rayleigh wave (see Fig. 1). In this paper results of investigations of two types of primary electronic circuits are presented and discussed. The first one is the oscillator with frequency output signal and the second is the phase-shift output circuit. 2. FREQUENCY OUTPUT CONDITIONING CIRCIUT As a conditioning circuit for SAW sensors the electronic oscillators are often applied – the delay line with SAW transducer is placed in the feedback loop of an amplifier. The acoustic delay line ensures the phase condition for oscillation, whilst the amplifier ensures the amplitude condition. The main disadvantages of this simple configuration are high output frequency range (30 – 150 MHz) and a weak thermal stability.

40|$|Summary. Recent {{evidence}} {{points to}} involvement of central nervous system oscillators in Parkinson’s disease (PD) rest tremor. It remains unknown whether one or multiple oscillators cause tremor in multiple limbs. Based on the prediction that multiple oscillators would cause low coherence even with similar average frequency, we studied 22 PD patients using accelerometers on multiple limbs. Records were digitized and spectral analysis was performed. Peak frequencies in the arms, legs, and chin were similar, indicating that biomechanical factors did not determine the frequency. Coherence between different axes of individual accelerometers and between different segments of the same limb was high. However, coherence between tremor in different limbs was low. There was no consistent pattern across patients of ipsi- vs. contralateral predominance of coherence.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed an}} integrated computational {{model for the}} network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls {{the dynamics of the}} mammalian cell cycle [C. Gérard and A. Goldbeter, "Temporal self-organization of the cyclin/Cdk network driving the mammalian cell cycle," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106, 21643 (2009) ]. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, protein synthesis or degradation, and the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor pRB and the transcription factor E 2 F. Increasing the level of a growth factor above a critical threshold triggers the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D/Cdk 4 - 6 in G 1, cyclin E/Cdk 2 at the G 1 /S transition, cyclin A/Cdk 2 in S and at the S/G 2 transition, and cyclin B/Cdk 1 at the G 2 /M transition. This periodic, ordered activation of the various cyclin/Cdk complexes can be associated with cell proliferation. The multiplicity of feedback loops within the Cdk network is such that it contains at least four distinct circuits capable of producing oscillations. The tight coupling of these <b>oscillatory</b> <b>circuits</b> generally results in simple periodic behavior associated with repetitive cycles of mitosis or with endoreplication. The latter corresponds to multiple passages through the phase of DNA replication without mitosis. We show here that, {{as a result of the}} interaction between the multiple <b>oscillatory</b> <b>circuits,</b> particularly when attenuating the strength of the oscillatory module involving cyclin B/Cdk 1, the model for the Cdk network can also produce complex periodic oscillations, quasiperiodic oscillations, and chaos. Numerical simulations based on limited explorations in parameter space nevertheless suggest that these complex modes of oscillatory behavior remain less common than the evolution to simple periodic oscillations of the limit cycle type, holding with the view that simple periodic oscillations in the Cdk network correspond to its physiological mode of dynamic behavior.

We found that the cooperative binding of repressor molecules is not mandatory for a oscillatory behavior if there are enough binding sites in the CRS. These oscillations depend on an adequate balance between the CRS kinetic, and the synthesis/degradation rates of repressor molecules.
