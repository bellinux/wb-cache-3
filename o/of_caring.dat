5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for them are high. Direct and indirect costs <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} impact of a Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Resident Pharmacist on (1) heart failure 30 -day {{hospital}} readmissions and (2) compliance with Joint Commission Heart Failure core measure 1 at a community hospital. Methods: The Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network led by a Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Resident Pharmacist was established in August 2011. The Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Resident Pharmacist followed Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network patients and retrospectively collected data from August 2011 to December 2012. Thirty-day readmission rates for Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network heart failure patients versus non-Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network heart failure patients were compared and analyzed. Joint Commission Heart Failure core measure 1 compliance rates were retrospectively collected from January 2011 and compared to data after establishment of the Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network. Results: In all, 162 Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network patients and 470 non-Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network patients were discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure from August 2011 to December 2012. Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network heart failure patients had a lower 30 -day all-cause readmission rate compared to non-Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network heart failure patients (12 % versus 24 %, respectively; p[*]=[*] 0. 005). In addition, Heart Failure core measure 1 compliance rates improved from the 80 th percentile to the 90 th percentile after implementation of the Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Network (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). The top three interventions performed by the Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Resident Pharmacist were discharge counseling (74. 1 %), providing a MedActionPlan™ (68. 5 %), and resolving medication reconciliation discrepancies (64. 8 %). Conclusion: The study findings suggest that a Continuum <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> Resident Pharmacist contributed to lowered heart failure readmission rates and improved Heart Failure core measure 1 compliance rates.

These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the Pheasants and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles <b>of</b> <b>caring,</b> self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics <b>of</b> <b>caring.</b> Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} definition <b>of</b> system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> {{was developed}} 20 years ago largely {{in response to}} the fragmented services experienced by children with serious emotional disorders and their families, who, typically, were involved in multiple systems and/or receiving services from different providers. Over time, in response to national funders' pursuing system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for different populations and their own experience, states, tribes and localities have applied system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> principles, values and operational characteristics to other populations (children and adults). The definition offered by Hodges et al., has an unintended effect of constraining the properties (and potential) <b>of</b> system <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in its limitation to a single population.
