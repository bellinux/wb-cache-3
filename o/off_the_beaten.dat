This is an interesting work. It is not a commentary of Thomas Aquinas, as one might expect, but rather an original study by Hagius. Though the method used is clearly that common to Scholasticism, Hagius ventures to break <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> track and explore themes which were usually not dealt with very frequently by Scholastics. The work {{is a collection of}} nine ‘Books’.

5000|$|Created in 1993, Quartier Éphémère’s {{mission is}} to invest in 'in situ' {{projects}} within vacant or abandoned Montreal industrial buildings and to reach a diverse public, <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> track of contemporary art. The Darling Foundry, which is a former metalworking factory, is one of QE’s projects. By turning buildings which {{were about to be}} demolished into artistic place, the association saved a total of 3500 square meters in the Faubourg des Recollets’s area. The Darling Foundry visual arts centre started its activity by opening its exhibition area in 2002. In 2006, the association inaugurated 12 artists studios {{in the second part of}} the building. The building is classified as an [...] "exceptional heritage value building" [...] in the Montreal Built Heritage great repertoire. Its transformation from a foundry into an art center was one of the first industrial heritage recycling success.|$|R

It is quite a large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water.|$|E
25|$|The game {{consists}} of multiple chapters, each consisting of several verses. Depending {{on how well}} the player performs, they are given {{one of the following}} medals {{at the end of the}} verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of Viewtiful Joe. There are some medals that are earned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> path, such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award is given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred. In between chapters there is a minigame called Angel Attack, in which players use Arcade Bullets found in the main levels to shoot at angels and earn points. These points can be traded in for items, with any leftover points exchanged for halos.|$|E

60|$|Dusk was {{creeping}} {{up from the}} eastwards across the great snow-sheeted plain when Leland pulled his horses up where a little by-track branched <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> trail. Behind him the wilderness, losing its gleaming whiteness and fading into shades of soft blue-grey, ran level to the hard blueness on the northern horizon. In front of him there were rolling rises ridged with sinuous bands of birches, black in broken masses against the lingering light {{in the south and}} west. There was room for wheat enough to glut markets of the world on the leagues of rich black loam that undulated to the frozen waters of Lake Winnipeg. Already miles of it were banded together by belts of two-foot stubble; but as yet the plough had not invaded the land of bluff and ravine, creek and coulee, where the shaggy broncho and the wild steer ran.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, Craig {{started to}} date Alice Piper (Toni Potter) {{and tried to}} stop Sarah marrying TK, but ended up escorting Sarah to the {{ceremony}} himself. Craig suffered a huge heart attack at the wedding party and was infuriated by Alice treating him like a patient. In 2008, Craig was devastated when he nearly lost Alice to The Ferndale Strangler and helped her through her post-traumatic stress before he proposed. Alice became pregnant but Craig broke it off when he realised she had cheated on him. He was devastated to learn how badly bullied his daughter Scarlett (Nicole Thomson) was and left Shortland Street for a position at pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, where he hoped he could expose their illegal activities. However, shortly after discovering sufficient evidence, Craig was run <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road, <b>beaten</b> and set alight by hired thugs. A memorial service was held days later, where Sarah sang a song highlighting Craig's personality. With Craig's evidence, Scott Spear was shut down in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{followed}} {{in the same year}} by Released with appearances from Allan Price on drums, and guest saxophonist Dave Conners. Here Jade Warrior sharpened their rock edge ("Three Horned Dragon King", [...] "Minnamato's Dream", the fifteen-minute rock jam [...] "Barazinbar"), their quieter side represented by pieces like [...] "Yellow Eyes" [...] and [...] "Bride of Summer". According to critic Peter Thelen, [...] "where the first album featured an array of sonic possibilities, this is an album that highlighted the contrasts within that sound". [...] "If Jade Warrior's second album has any overwhelming flaw, it is that its predecessor traveled so far <b>off</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>beaten</b> tracks of early-'70s prog that anything less than absolute reinvention could only be regarded as a rerun of past glories", AllMusic argued years later. [...] "…There is little here that Jade Warrior itself did not predict, but the unerring delivery of those predictions is a marvel in itself", critic Dave Thompson concluded.|$|R
500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> track. Western tourists {{expected to see}} stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing {{to see more of the}} wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E

In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C. Whitson, in Opera News, reported that worldwide, [...] "between 2007 and 2009, half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S.". San Diego's director, Ian Campbell, suggested that his company's 2004 production was [...] "created {{at a time when}} it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not-too-expensive production with melody, and a little <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> track ....

500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience. And, while {{the game itself}} may not have broken any new ground, the world it introduces more than makes up for that. It will leave gamers hungry for more." [...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E
5000|$|The industrialization, {{urbanization}} and unsustainable agriculture {{practices of}} human society {{are considered to}} be having a serious impact on the environment. Ecotourism is now also considered to be playing a role in environmental depletion. While the term ecotourism may sound relatively benign, one of its most serious impacts is its consumption of virgin territories. These invasions often include deforestation, disruption of ecological life systems and various forms of pollution, all of which contribute to environmental degradation. For example, the number of motor vehicles crossing a park increases as tour drivers search for rare species. The number of roads disrupts the grass cover, which has serious consequences on plant and animal species. These areas also have a higher rate of disturbances and invasive species due to increasing traffic <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> path into new, undiscovered areas. Ecotourism also has an effect on species through the value placed on them. [...] "Certain species have gone from being little known or valued by local people to being highly valued commodities. The commodification of plants may erase their social value and lead to overproduction within protected areas. Local people and their images can also be turned into commodities". Camaro brings up a relatively obvious contradiction, any commercial venture into unspoiled, pristine land with or without the [...] "eco" [...] prefix as a contradiction in terms. To generate revenue {{you have to have a}} high number of traffic, tourists, which inevitably means a higher pressure on the environment.|$|R

60|$|On {{my return}} from Paris, {{about a year}} afterwards, I turned <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> route at Rouen, to revisit {{some of the most}} {{striking}} scenes of Lower Normandy. Having passed through the lovely country of the Pays d'Auge, I reached Honfleur on a fine afternoon, intending to cross to Havre the next morning, and embark for England. As I had no better way of passing the evening, I strolled up the hill to enjoy the fine prospect from the chapel of Notre Dame de Grace; and while there, I thought of inquiring after the fate of poor Annette Delarbre. The priest who had told me her story was officiating at vespers, after which I accosted him, and learnt from him the remaining circumstances. He told me that from the time I had seen her at the chapel, her disorder took a sudden turn for the worse, and her health rapidly declined. Her cheerful intervals became shorter and less frequent, and attended with more incoherency. She grew languid, silent, and moody in her melancholy; her form was wasted, her looks pale and disconsolate, and it was feared she would never recover. She became impatient of all sounds of gayety, and was never so contented as when Eugene's mother was near her. The good woman watched over her with patient, yearning solicitude; and in seeking to beguile her sorrows, would half forget her own. Sometimes, as she sat looking upon her pallid face, the tears would fill her eyes, which, when Annette perceived, she would anxiously wipe them away, and tell her not to grieve, for that Eugene would soon return; and then she would affect a forced gayety, as in former times, and sing a lively air; but a sudden recollection would come over her, and she would burst into tears, hang on the poor mother's neck, and entreat her not to curse her for having destroyed her son.|$|R
