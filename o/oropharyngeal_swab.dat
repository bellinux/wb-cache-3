40|$|Brain {{analysis}} {{cannot be}} used for the investigation of active lyssavirus infection in healthy bats because most bat species are protected by conservation directives. Consequently, serology remains the only tool for performing virological studies on natural bat populations; however, the presence of antibodies merely reflects past exposure to the virus and is not a valid marker of active infection. This work describes a new nested reverse transcription (RT) -PCR technique specifically designed for the detection of the European bat virus 1 on <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> obtained from bats but also able to amplify RNA from the remaining rabies-related lyssaviruses in brain samples. The technique was successfully used for surveillance of a serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) colony involved in a case of human exposure, in which 15 out of 71 <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> were positive. Lyssavirus infection was detected on 13 <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> but in only 5 brains out of the 34 animals from which simultaneous brain and oropharyngeal samples had been taken. The lyssavirus involved could be rapidly identified by automatic sequencing of the RT-PCR products obtained from 14 brains and three bat <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs.</b> In conclusion, RT-PCR using <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> will permit screening of wild bat populations for active lyssavirus infection, for research or epidemiological purposes, in line not only with conservation policies but also in a more efficient manner than classical detection techniques used on the brain...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, active bat rabies {{surveillance}} {{was conducted}} between 1993 and 2012. A total of 4546 <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swab</b> samples from 18 bat species were screened {{for the presence}} of EBLV- 1 -, EBLV- 2 - and BBLV-specific RNA.

Aims We aimed to describe RHD prevalence {{in children and}} adults in North Madagascar using the most updated World Heart Federation (WHF) criteria for RHD echocardiographic diagnosis. Methods Children aged 5 – 19 years (Group One) and adults aged more than 20 years (Group Two) underwent a four-steps visit: clinical questionnaire, physical examination, laboratory test - <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swab</b> for Group One and Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titre for Group Two - and echocardiogram using a portable machine [...] Results Among 859 people (522 in Group One, 337 in Group Two) RHD prevalence was 2. 1 per cent. Group Two had {{a higher risk of}} having RHD than Group One (OR 4. 39, CI 1. 39 – 13. 9, p= 0. 004), while clinical findings were more frequent in Group One (children had a higher risk of heart murmur (O.

40|$|The {{advent of}} PCR has {{improved}} {{the identification of}} viruses in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Several studies have used PCR to establish the importance of viruses in the aetiology of CAP. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies that reported the proportion of viral infection detected via PCR in patients with CAP. We excluded studies with paediatric populations. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with viral infection. The secondary outcome was short-term mortality. Our review included 31 studies. Most obtained PCR via nasopharyngeal or <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swab.</b> The pooled proportion of patients with viral infection was 24. 5 % (95 % CI 21. 5 – 27. 5 %). In studies that obtained lower respiratory samples in > 50 % of patients, the proportion was 44. 2 % (95 % CI 35. 1 – 53. 3 %). The odds of death were higher in patients with dual bacterial and viral infection (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 32 – 3. 31). Viral infection is present in {{a high proportion of}} patients with CAP. The true proportion of viral infection is probably underestimated because of negative test results from nasopharyngeal or <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swab</b> PCR.

40|$|Background: Lower {{respiratory}} tract infection (LRTI) is a {{main cause of}} hospitalization in infants and children. These patients’ nasopharyngeal swabs more frequently contain respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than human adenovirus (HAdV) in cold seasons; recent data suggest that <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> more frequently contain HAdV than RSV. Knowing more about virus detection with <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> seasonal fluctuations and age-related distribution of RSV and HAdV would help treat children hospitalized for LRTI more effectively. We investigated the seasonal virus-related frequency (as assessed by <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs)</b> and environmental and clinical features in infants and children hospitalized for LRTI from autumn to spring. Methods: We studied 98 subjects hospitalized for LRTI in our Pediatric Unit, from November 2006 to May 2007. RSV and HAdV in <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Results: PCR assays more frequently detected HAdV (29. 6 % of patients) than RSV (25. 5 %). The seasonal incidence also differed (RSV, narrow peak in December and HAdV, wide peak from April to May). Most patients infected with RSV were aged 2 yrs or younger (23 / 25 : 88 %); no difference was found in age between subjects who tested HAdV-positive (13 / 29 : 45 %) or undetectable-virus (23 / 44 : 52 %). Bronchiolitis was more frequently associated with RSV than HAdV or undetectable-virus <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs.</b> No difference was found in risk factors (school attendance, atopic parents, exposure to cigarette smoking, home dampness or exposure to animals) or clinical features (vital parameters or duration of hospital stay) among the three viral groups.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that the airway microbiota might be involved in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Understanding this relationship requires examination of a large-scale population for a long duration to accurately monitor changes in the microbiome. This type of longitudinal study requires an appropriate sampling strategy; two options are the collection of sputum or <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs.</b> Comparative analysis of the changes that occur in these two specimen types has not been previously performed. This observational study was conducted to explore oropharyngeal microbial community dynamics over time and {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> and sputum. A total of 114 samples were collected from four patients suffering from severe AECOPD. Bacterial and fungal communities were evaluated using 16 S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Inter-individual differences were found in bacterial community structure, but the core genera were shared by both sample types and included 32 lineages. Most of the core genera were members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Ascomycota. Although the oropharyngeal samples showed higher bacterial alpha diversity, the two sample types generated rather similar taxonomic profiles. These results suggest that the sputum microbiome is remarkably similar to the oropharyngeal microbiome.

Four swab types were compared regarding (1) participants' satisfaction and acceptance and (2) detection of microbial community structures based on deep sequencing of the 16 [*]S rRNA gene V 1 -V 2 variable regions. All swabbing methods were highly accepted. Microbial community structure analysis revealed 846 phylotypes, 46 of which were unique to oropharynx and 164 unique to nares.

40|$|During {{the winter}} season upper {{respiratory}} tract secretions from 166 patients with stable {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) or asthma were simultaneously cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae and tested for pneumococcal capsular antigen. Latex agglutination was employed to investigate the effect of pneumococcal carriership on pneumococcal capsular antigen detection in {{upper respiratory tract}} secretions. All specimens originating from the oropharynx, nasopharynx and saliva were both cultured and investigated in parallel for the presence of antigen. The recovery of pneumococci from the different areas was unequally distributed (oropharynx 29 %, nasopharynx 8 %, and saliva 16 %), with the highest isolation rate from the oropharynx alone. Only 4 (3 %) of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> 1 (1 %) of the nasopharyngeal swabs and 14 (9 %) of the saliva specimens yielded both pneumococcal antigen and a positive culture for S. pneumoniae. A further 9 (6 %) of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> 5 (3 %) of the nasopharyngeal swabs, and 50 (33 %) of the saliva specimens were antigen positive only, with no pneumococci isolated on culture.

40|$|Background: Wild mallards (Anas platyrhychos) are {{considered}} one of the primary reservoir species for avian influenza viruses (AIV). Because AIV circulating in wild birds pose an indirect threat to agriculture and human health, understanding the ecology of AIV and developing risk assessments and surveillance systems for prevention of disease is critical. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, mallards were experimentally infected with an H 4 N 6 subtype of AIV by oral inoculation or contact with an H 4 N 6 contaminated water source. Cloacal <b>swabs,</b> <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> fecal samples, and water samples were collected daily and tested by real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) for estimation of viral shedding. Fecal samples had significantly higher virus concentrations than <b>oropharyngeal</b> or cloacal <b>swabs</b> and 6 month old ducks shed significantly more viral RNA than 3 month old ducks regardless of sample type. Use of a water source contaminated by AIV infected mallards, was sufficient to transmit virus to naïve mallards, which shed AIV at higher or similar levels as orally-inoculated ducks. Conclusions: Bodies of water could serve as a transmission pathway for AIV in waterfowl. For AIV surveillance purposes, water samples and fecal samples appear to be excellent alternatives or additions to cloacal and <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabbing.</b> Furthermore, duck age (even within hatch-year birds) may be important when interpreting viral shedding results from experimental infections or surveillance.

Of the 15 hospitalized patients, 4 had asthma, and 5 were overweight or obese. All but 1 of these 9 patients developed influenza-related complications. Overall, 10 of the 15 hospitalized patients (67 %) developed an influenza-related complication (6 bronchitis and 4 pneumonia). Conclusion. In this cohort, most children with confirmed H 1 N 1 infection experience an uncomplicated viral illness. Nevertheless, underlying asthma and obesity may aggravate their clinical course...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To assess {{bacterial}} colonization prospectively {{in patients}} with cystic fibrosis identified by neonatal screening. To assess susceptibility to antimicrobials and to perform the molecular typing of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from the oropharynx of patients during the study. Methods: Twenty-five cystic fibrosis patients receiving regular treatment at the Cystic Fibrosis Outpatient Clinic of Hospital de Clínicas of Universidade Federal do ParanÆ, Brazil, {{were included in the}} study. All patients were identified by trypsin-like immunoreactivity and their diagnosis was confirmed by two or more sweat tests. <b>Oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected and cultured according to routine methods; bacterial colonies were phenotypically identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobials was tested. S. aureus isolates were submitted to molecular typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results: Out of 234 <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> S. aureus was the most frequently isolated strain (76 % of patients, 42 % of swabs), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36 % of patients, 16 % of swabs) and Haemophilus spp. (76 % of patients; 19 % of swabs). Seventy-three isolates were obtained from 19 patients colonized with S. aureus, of which 18 were oxacillin-resistant (24. 6 %), isolated from two patients, with the same electrophoretic profiles as that of the Brazilian clone. The remaining oxacillin-sensitive isolates were distributed into 18 electrophoretic profiles...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Healthy {{carriers}} of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) {{play an important}} role in the spread of invasive disease. The aim of this study was to assess the need for Hib vaccination in Iranian children by estimating the prevalence of Hib oropharyngeal colonization among children in Tehran. Cultures were prepared from <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs</b> of 1000 children in 25 day-care centres in Tehran from October 2005 to March 2006. The prevalence of Hib carriers was 7. 6 %, similar to other developing countries prior to inoculation with the conjugate Hib vaccine. We recommend Hib vaccination b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} Flavivirus infection in birds captured in green areas of São Paulo. METHODS: <b>Oropharyngeal</b> <b>swabs,</b> cloacal swabs, and blood samples from 170 birds captured in two green areas in São Paulo, Brazil {{were subjected to}} real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of Flavivirus specific NS 5 gene fragment. RESULTS: All samples were negative {{for the presence of}} viral ribonucleic acid (RNA). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the negative results, Flavivirus surveillance must be performed regularly due to favorable ecological conditions for virus circulation and transmission among birds in these areas and their close proximity to humans...|$|R
