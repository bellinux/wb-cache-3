50|$|An <b>orifice</b> gas <b>meter</b> {{consists}} of a straight length of pipe inside which a precisely known orifice plate creates a pressure drop, thereby affecting flow. <b>Orifice</b> <b>meters</b> are a type of differential meter, all of which infer the rate of gas flow by measuring the pressure difference across a deliberately designed and installed flow disturbance. The gas static pressure, density, viscosity, and temperature must be measured or known {{in addition to the}} differential pressure for the meter to accurately measure the fluid. <b>Orifice</b> <b>meters</b> often do not handle a large range of flow rates. They are however accepted and understood in industrial applications since they are easy to field-service and have no moving parts.|$|R

Recent technological innovations in flow metering have produced clamp-on, portable flow meters to measure liquids. This paper reviews the principles of ultrasonic flow meters. Applications and costs of ultrasonic versus <b>orifice</b> flow <b>meters</b> are important to consider in energy audits. A discussion follows on 'how' and 'where' to use ultrasonic flowmeters.

50|$|An <b>orifice</b> plate <b>meter</b> has a {{practical}} turndown ratio of 3:1.|$|R
50|$|The {{turndown}} ratio {{of each type}} of meter is limited by theoretical considerations and by practical considerations. For example, <b>orifice</b> <b>meters</b> create a pressure drop in the measured fluid proportional to {{the square of the}} velocity. Therefore the range of differential pressure can become too large and compromise accuracy. It can also create process problems such as hydrate formation, {{and in the case of}} measuring the discharge of a compressor, there is a limit to how much pressure loss is acceptable.|$|R

5000|$|The turbine meter is {{available}} in various manufacturer's configurations of a common theme; [...] turbine blades and rotor configured devices. These devices are designed such that when a gas stream passes through them they will spin proportionally {{to the amount of}} gas passing over the blades in a repeatable fashion. Accuracy is then ensured by completion of a calibration, indicating the relationship between rotational speed and volume, at various Reynolds Numbers. The fundamental difference between the <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> and the turbine meter is the flow equation derivation. The <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> flow calculation is based on fluid flow fundamentals (a 1st Law of Thermodynamics derivation utilizing the pipe diameter and vena contracta diameters for the continuity equation). Deviations from theoretical expectation can be assumed under the Coefficient of Discharge. Thus, one can manufacture an <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> of known uncertainty with only the measurement standard in hand and access to a machine shop. The need for flow conditioning, and hence, a fully developed velocity flow profile is driven from the original determination of Cd which utilized fully developed or 'reference profiles' as explained above.|$|E
50|$|A {{venturi meter}} {{can be used}} to measure the flow rates of all {{incompressible}} fluids (gases with low pressure variations, as wells as liquids), whereas an <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> is generally used for measuring the flow rate of liquid.|$|E
50|$|In a venturi meter,the flow {{velocity}} {{is measured by}} noting the pressure differences between the inlet and the throat of the venturi meter ,whereas in the <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> the discharge velocity is measured by using a pitot tube or a trajectory method.|$|E
40|$|This note {{summarizes}} the practical conclusions {{of a study}} of the influence of nonstandard approach sections (swept bends, orifice plates⋯) on the relative error on the flow coefficient of <b>orifice</b> <b>meters.</b> On the basis of experimented curves of “error versus upstream distance” for a few studied pipe fittings, it is shown that a correlation can be defined and used for the predetermination of the almost complete curve of many other pipe fittings for which the error is only given by the standards for a limited number of upstream distances. © 1978 by ASME.

50|$|The Dall tube is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} a Venturi meter, with a lower pressure drop than an orifice plate. As with these flow meters the flow rate in a Dall tube is determined by measuring the pressure drop caused by restriction in the conduit. The pressure differential is typically measured using diaphragm pressure transducers with digital readout. Since these meters have significantly lower permanent pressure losses than <b>orifice</b> <b>meters,</b> Dall tubes are widely used for measuring the flow rate of large pipeworks. Differential pressure produced by a Dall tube is higher than Venturi tube and nozzle, all of them having same throat diameters.|$|R
5000|$|Flow meters for the {{measurements}} {{in the oil}} and gas upstream industry are chosen based on type of measurement, performance and accuracy requirements, and the type of medium to be measured. Available meters in the market are characterized by properties such as accuracy, operational rangebility: flowrate, viscosity, velocity, pressure and temperature conditions, durability and demand with respect to calibration and monitoring, the ability to withstand contaminants, injected chemicals, salty and acidic environment. For the application of custody transfer measurements of fluid hydrocarbons, positive displacement meters and turbine meters have been preferred. [...] For gas <b>metering,</b> gas <b>orifice</b> <b>meters</b> and ultrasonic flow meters are most common. Coriolis meters are in use for liquid measurements, but can also take gas measurement applications.|$|R
50|$|An <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> or {{orifice plate}} is a flat plate having a central hole that is placed across {{the flow of}} a liquid, usually between flanges in a pipeline. The {{pressure}} difference generated by the flow velocity through the hole enables the flow quantity to be measured.|$|E
50|$|Venturi meters {{are only}} {{installed}} in pipelines, and the accelerated {{flow through the}} apparatus is subsequently decelerated to the original velocity at the outlet of the venturi meter. The flow continues through the pipe line. In the <b>orifice</b> <b>meter,</b> the entire potential energy of the fluid is converted into kinetic energy, and the jet discharges freely into the open atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Orifice meters {{are a very}} {{commonly}} used type of meter, and because of their widespread use, the characteristics of gas flow through an <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> have been closely studied. American Gas Association Report No. 3 deals with {{a broad range of}} issues relating to orifice metering of natural gas, and it specifies an algorithm for calculating natural gas flow rates based on the differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature of a gas with a known composition.|$|E

40|$|Flow {{measurement}} is {{a complex}} and application related discipline. It borders on being an art rather than a science, and as such it has developed its own mystique, traditions and customs. While {{it is true that}} no meter is universally applicable to all situations, the orifice has been more widely used in industrial settings than any other flowmeter. Unfortunately this legacy has carried the usage of <b>orifice</b> <b>meters</b> into now measurement applications where it is poorly suited, but who could argue when it was the best choice available. No area typifies this situation more than the problem of measuring steam flows. While the orifice has a number of draw back for steam flow measurement, it is superior to the only alternative available (until recently) - the condensate meter. This being the situation, the stage was set for the development and introduction of new technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Orifice</b> <b>meter</b> is a flow {{measuring}} device which {{is widely used}} in various industrial applications. Although the device gives accurate measurement during steady flow, measurement errors related to square root and sampling errors are unavoidable if pulsations exist. This research investigatesand improves the performance of an orifice plate flow meter under pulsation effects. A simple model for the pulsating flow through an <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> is presented. Square root error (SRE) is estimated.

Also BV is a sub-term which come from pressure loss in the orifice hole. The equation (1) may ploted on linear relation between (dH/V) and V, therefor there are no dificulties to determine the values of A and B.

40|$|<b>Orifice</b> flow <b>meter</b> {{is used in}} many {{laboratory}} and industrial application due because of its simple design and low cost. The present research investigated an <b>orifice</b> flow <b>meter</b> operated in relatively low flow rate. Orifice plate is a metal plate, 10 mm width provided with bevel at inlet section. The diameter ratios (β) are 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, and 0. 8, respectively. The experiment used water with flowrate range having Reynolds number between 6827, 55 and 8004, 72. The fluid is flown through the orifice plate. Pressure taps are used to measure pressure at upstream and downstream of the orifice plate. The actual capacity is directly measured at an outlet reservoir; while the theoretical capacity is calculated using modified Bernoulli equation with diameter ratio (β) within the equation. The {{results showed that the}} irrecoverable pressure drop decreased with the increase of flow capacity and the diameter ratio.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of <b>orifice</b> plate <b>metering</b> to poor conditioned flow and swirling flow are subjects of concerns to flow meter users and manufacturers. The distortions caused by pipefittings and pipe installations upstream of the orifice plate are {{major sources of}} poorly conditioned and swirling flow. These distortions will alter the accuracy of metering by an unacceptable degree up to 7 % error in standard discharge coefficient. So the design of <b>orifice</b> plate <b>meters</b> that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major object of flow metering. This goal is usually conducted by using a flow conditioner. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to describe the development of the orifice plate combined with swirler flow conditioner that is insensitive to upstream disturbances. The experimental results by using the new swirler flow conditioner shows this flow conditioner can attenuate the effect of both swirling and asymmetric flow on metering to an acceptable level...|$|R
40|$|A classic {{method of}} {{measuring}} energy delivered {{is to use}} an <b>Orifice</b> <b>meter</b> run and a circular chart recorder to obtain an integrated value for the flow. This flow measurement is combined with an average caloric value to obtain energy delivered. This method can be based when changes in the calorific value correlate with changes in the flow. This classic method is next compared with two newer methods of measuring energy delivered. The first method uses a flow computer which has as inputs the pressure, temperature, and pressure differential from an <b>Orifice</b> <b>meter.</b> This method also uses continuous measurements of relative density and calorific value. The output from the flowcomputer is the instantaneous energy flow. The second method uses a new energy flowmeter that is under development. It directly measures energy flow without measuring either calorific value or volumetric flow. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:Measurement of flow is an {{important}} aspect {{in the field of}} hydraulic engineering, both in case of open channel as well as pipe or conduits. In case of pipe conduits various flow meters are used for flow estimation; out of which venturimeter and <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> are most commonly used and conventional means. Pipes or conduit carrying sediment laden flow or slurry-water mixture is very common in most of the industries, sewage carrying system etc. Suitability of flow meters i. e. venturimeter and flow meter need to be analyzed for sediment laden flow. Due to the presence of slurry or sediments, coefficient of discharge of flow meter will vary. In the present paper, various works that have been carried out till now in the analysis of characteristics of venturimeter and <b>orifice</b> <b>meter</b> with sediment laden flow are described...|$|E

40|$|Wave rotors {{may play}} a role as topping cycles for jet engines, since by their use, the {{combustion}} temperature can be raised without increasing the turbine inlet temperature. In order to design a wave rotor for this, or any other application, knowledge of the loss mechanisms is required, and also how the design parameters affect those losses. At NASA LeRC, a 3 -port wave rotor experiment operating on the flow-divider cycle, has been started with the objective of determining the losses. The experimental scheme is a three factor Box-Behnken design, with passage opening time, friction factor, and leakage gap as the factors. Variation of these factors is provided by using two rotors, of different length, two different passage widths for each rotor, and adjustable leakage gap. In the experiment, pressure transducers are mounted on the rotor, and give pressure traces as a function of rotational angle at the entrance and exit of a rotor passage. In addition, pitot rakes monitor the stagnation pressures for each port, and <b>orifice</b> <b>meters</b> measure the mass flows. The results show that leakage losses are very significant in the present experiment, but can be reduced considerably by decreasing the rotor to wall clearance spacing...|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{the case}} of an <b>orifice</b> flow <b>meter,</b> the {{differential}} pressure across the orifice plate is the primary flow element. A turbine meter is equipped with a magnetic pickup that senses the proximity of the turbine blades as the fluid motion causes the turbine to spin; this pickup is the primary flow element for a turbine meter. Diaphragm meters and other positive displacement meters are equipped with a crank shaft, the rotation of which acts as the primary flow element.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for simultaneous estimation of multiphase flow rate and stream composition {{has been developed}} to be applied in a multiple restriction assembly composed of two <b>orifice</b> <b>meters</b> and a cage trim valve. These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through cage trim valves. 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through <b>orifice</b> plate <b>meters</b> {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step. Three wells named Well 1, Well 2 and Well 3 were single routed to a test separator. Two types of well performance were investigated: 1) production with stream composition variation caused by gas/water coning. 2) production with steady state composition. Eight wellhead variables were monitored: two orifice plate differential pressures, the differential pressure and temperature through the cage valve, the downstream choke pressure, the wellhead pressure and temperature and the gathering system temperature. The field scale experiments generated a database composed by 1781 test points, averaged in 30 minutes interval. Multiphase flow expansion process through cage trim valve is discussed in chapter 2. It represents an enabler investigation to the thesis main objective. A systematic error in the downstream temperature was calculated up to 8...|$|R
