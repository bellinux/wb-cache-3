The MWAA Vice President and Airport Manager for Dulles International and the MWAA Deputy Chief of Police both refused to provide the legally required attorney access, despite confirming {{that they had the}} codes necessary to open the doors to the location where CBP was detaining individuals based on President Trump's executive order.

Oakland was second of the two plants to begin production {{and the first to}} close. De Vaux-Hall filed for bankruptcy in February 1932, unable to pay its creditors (including Continental). De Vaux produced 4,808 vehicles (maybe including production until January, 1932). Days after De Vaux-Hall announced its bankruptcy, Continental Motors Corporation announced it would buy the Michigan assets of De Vaux-Hall; De Vaux-Hall owed the engine maker nearly a half million dollars. The new owner renamed the company Continental-De Vaux Company. Their cars were then called Continental De Vaux (sometimes vice versa). There were few changes and only 1,358 were built (sources differ).|$|E

50|$|Charles Henry Roe {{was born}} 22 May 1887 in York. His father Charles Roe {{worked for the}} North Eastern Railway at their {{carriage}} works in the town, eventually rising to a foreman's position. C.H. Roe served his apprenticeship at the drawing office of the carriage works and his first job after gaining his trade in 1912 was as a draughtsman at the Wakefield works of Charles Roberts & Company who built railway rolling stock. A year later he moved to Leeds to work {{as an assistant to}} the chief engineer at the Hunslet-based RET Construction Co who was a pioneer builder of trolleybuses. Whilst there he worked on a twin-shaft drive transmission system from the traction motors of the trolleybus chassis to replace a previous chain-drive arrangement and designed a lightweight body featuring steel panels over a suitably reinforced teak body frame. As an engineer and draughtsman he was exempt from World War I conscription. Customers for the RET vehicle with Roe-designed bodies included the trolleybus systems of Bloemfontein Corporation, the Shanghai Transport Company and Ramsbottom Urban District Council. The Ramsbottom examples were to a steel-frame design but it was wood and metal composite construction particularly using teak that became synonymous with the C.H. Roe name. The RET business had gone through one bankruptcy prior to C.H. Roe joining, originally having been founded as the Railless Electric Traction Company Ltd in 1908. In 1916, the RET Company was required under war regulations to turn over production to munitions and being unable to supply <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> for trolleybuses was closed down in 1917.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the curious}} twists of Great Plains history {{is that the}} first {{accurate}} eyewitness map of the Missouri River in what is now North and South Dakota-the historic home of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Indians and of their nomadic neighbors-was produced by a Welshman who had come to the United States to seek evidence for something that never existed: the illusory 2 ̆ 2 welsh Indians. 2 ̆ 2 The inquisitive welsh explorer, John Thomas Evans (1770 - 99), did not find what he came to discover, but he produced what was {{to be one of the}} most important maps available to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in planning and executing their famous expedition up the Missouri River in 1804. Evans 2 ̆ 7 s map shows his route up the Missouri River from Fort Charles, located in what is now northeastern Nebraska near modern Sioux City, Iowa, to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages at the mouth of the Knife River in present-day North Dakota. The map illustrates in detail the major features of the Missouri River channel and shows all of its principal tributaries. It is a landmark of Missouri River cartography. Later mappers relied heavily upon it, as no less than ten secondary English, French, and Spanish maps of the period from 1797 to 1811 bear unmistakable evidence of their dependence on Evans 2 ̆ 7 s work. 1 The Evans map was especially important to the Lewis and Clark expedition. Clark repeatedly referred to it and verified Evans 2 ̆ 7 s earlier observations. Indeed, Evans (whose name Clark variously spelled Evins, Evens, and Ivens) named all of the major tributaries of the Missouri River in the area his map covered. In fact, it -remained for Lewis and Clark to name only a few minor streams below the Mandan and Hidatsa villages. Until they reached those villages they made only 2 ̆ 2 secondary and supplementary 2 ̆ 2 maps of the Missouri River, so precise and detailed was Evans 2 ̆ 7 s work. It was a major 2 ̆ 2 road map 2 ̆ 2 of the expedition for no less than seven hundred miles. 2 THE MACKAY -EVANS EXPEDITION OF 1795 - 97 Evans, together with James Mackay, led an expedition up the Missouri River between 1795 and 1797. 3 Sponsored by Spain, the party left Saint Louis in August, 1795, accompanied by thirty-three men-a party not much smaller than that of Lewis and Clark nine years later. In November they reached the Omaha Indians and built Fort Charles near their village in what is now Dakota County, located in northeastern Nebraska. Mackay subsequently sent Evans up the Missouri to obtain information on intertribal relations. Evans went as far as the mouth of the White River, which is located in south central South Dakota. Here he was forced to retreat by hostile Dakotas, and he returned to Fort Charles. In early 1796 Mackay again dispatched Evans upriver, this time with instructions to 2 ̆ 2 discover a passage from the sources of the Missouri to the Pacific Ocean. 2 ̆ 24 With these impossible <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> Evans ascended the Missouri River with a party of unknown size and succeeded in reaching the Mandan and Hidatsa villages at the mouth of the Knife River, in present North Dakota, on September 23, 1796. He remained near these villages through the following winter...|$|E
