5000|$|The fare {{structure}} is now {{designed to encourage}} the use of Oyster cards. Daily Travelcards are not sold on Oyster Card, but a system called 'Capping' ensures that on each day of use no more than the equivalent Travelcard price is deducted. Prior to January 2010 the <b>Oyster</b> <b>cap</b> was 50p less than a Travelcard, but now the cap for Oyster and Travelcard is the same. The balance can be automatically topped up with funds from a credit or debit card when the balance becomes low, a feature known as 'auto top-up'. Tickets and pay as you go credit can be purchased via a website or over the telephone.|$|E
