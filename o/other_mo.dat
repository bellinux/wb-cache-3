The Mo enzyme nitrogenase, with its unique polynuclear metal sulfide clusters, falls {{in a class by}} itself All <b>other</b> <b>Mo</b> and W enzymes are mononuclear, with pterin-ene-dithiolate coordination. Recent x-ray crystallographic results on several of these enzymes confirm the potential additional presence of 0 x 0 (one or two), sulfido, cysteine, selenocysteine, serine, aquohydroxo, and/or a second dithiolene in the various metal coordination spheres. The rich chemistry of multi-sulhr transition metal systems admits ligand redox, internal electron transfer, and 'intermediate ' redox states. This redox flexibility may facilitate coupled protodelectron transfer and/or 0 x 0 transfer mechanisms, which are effectively exploited by Mo and W enzymes. In the case of nitrogenase, a hypothesis is put forward that the relatively isolated heavy atom grouping at the FeMoco active site allows that site to become locally 'hot ' during turnover, thereby facilitating activation of the recalcitrant dinitrogen molecule.

40|$|Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungal zoopathogen of {{worldwide}} distribution {{that produces a}} broad spectrum of disease activity. In most cases the portal of entry is the lung, where inhaled spores and mycelial fragments of the fungus lodge within the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Here, transition from the mycelial phase to the yeast phase ensues, presumably over a period of hours to days. The mycelial to yeast phase conversion is critical since it is the yeast form ofH. capsulatum (Hc) ' that is responsible for the pathogenesis of histoplasmosis in nearly all of its clinical manifestations (1). The earliest pulmonary lesions induced by He yeasts in man and experimental animals are patches of pneumonitis consisting largely of parasitized macrophages (MO) (2 - 4).

ZnO NWs with diameters of 50 to 250 nm, lengths up to 10 μm and a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure were obtained with a high yield and uniformity not only on ≈ 1 nm Au/Si(001) and 1 nm Au/quartz via reactive vapour transport, but also on plain Si(001) at 550 °C. We find that the post growth nitridation of ZnO NWs under {{a steady flow of}} NH 3 is feasible for temperatures ≤ 600 °C since they maintain their integrity, and we observe not only a suppression of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks related to ZnO, but also the emergence of new ones corresponding to the cubic crystal structure of Zn 3 N 2 identical to that of Zn 3 N 2 layers which were grown on Au/Si(001) via the direct reaction of Zn with NH 3. Temperatures higher than 600 °C lead to the complete elimination of the ZnO NWs. We describe how the temperature-time profile and flows of Ar, NH 3 and H 2 influence the conversion of ZnO into Zn 3 N 2 and propose a mechanism whereby N reacts with Zn at the surface of the ZnO NWs undergoing reduction due to hydrogen and leading to the formation of a core-shell structure.|$|E

Clinical data on 339 successfully genotyped MO patients (patients with attacks of migraine without aura and no attacks of migraine with aura) were obtained by an extensive validated semi-structured telephone interview performed by a physician or a trained senior medical student. Reliable, systematic and extensive data on symptoms, age of onset, attack frequencies and duration, relevant comorbidity, specific provoking factors including different hormonal factors in females, and effect and use of medication, both abortive and prophylactic, were thereby obtained. A comparison of carriers and non-carriers were performed. Comparison of homozygotes with heterozygotes was not performed as the number of homozygotes was too small for statistical purposes.

In contrast to the existing optimization-based methods that attempt to minimize a weighted sum of SLL, SBL, and BWFN, we treat these as three distinct objectives that are to be achieved simultaneously and use one of the best known Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) of current interest called MOEA/D-DE (Decomposition based MOEA with Differential Evolution operator) to determine the best compromise among these three objectives. Unlike the single-objective approaches, the MO approach provides greater flexibility in the design by yielding a set of equivalent final solutions from which the user can choose one that attains a suitable trade-off margin as per requirements. We compared time-modulated antenna structures with other methods for linear array synthesis such as the excitation method and the phase-position synthesis method {{on the basis of the}} approximated Pareto Fronts (PFs) yielded by MOEA/D-DE and the best compromise solutions determined from the Pareto optimal set with a fuzzy membershipfunction based method.

40|$|Peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) {{of normal}} human donors {{simultaneously}} exhibit two subsets differing in their functional activity towards the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. One subset (on average, 25 % of total Mo) was characteristically able to ingest {{a large number}} of L. monocytogenes bacteria and permitted intracellular growth of these bacteria. The <b>other</b> <b>Mo</b> subpopulation (on average, 75 % of total Mo) was far less active in phagocytosing L. monocytogenes and restricted intracellular L. monocytogenes growth. Electron microscopy revealed that the Listeria-permissive Mo subset allowed the bacteria to escape to the cytosol, a mechanism by which these bacteria evade the lethal attack of phagocytes. The Listeria-restrictive Mo subset, on the other hand, confined the bacteria to the phagolysosomes, where they were exposed to the killing mechanisms of the Mo. Permissiveness for L. monocytogenes growth was further associated with differences in the capacity of the Mo subsets to synthesize tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha), an important mediator in the defense against intracellular bacteria. Following challenge with L. monocytogenes, the Listeria-restrictive Mo subset secreted two to six times more TNF-alpha than did the Listeria-permissive Mo subset. Enhanced TNF-alpha secretion was paralleled by increased accumulation of TNF-alpha mRNA as assessed by quantitative PCR. Despite these functional differences, the two Mo subsets were indistinguishable with respect to expression of cell surface markers known to be involved in adherence and phagocytosis of microbes. A speculative physiological role of the two Mo subsets may lie in the dual function of Mo as microbicidal effector cells and accessory cells for antigen-specific immune reactions...|$|E

The comparison allows an analysis of structural details of the molybdena species. The silica support is found {{to contribute to the}} NEXAFS spectrum in an energy range well above that of the molybdena units, allowing a clear separation between the corresponding contributions. Different types of oxygen species, O(1) in terminal MdO bonds, O(2) in interphase Mo—O—Si bridges and in Mo—O—Mo linkages, as well as O(2) in terminal Mo—O—H groups can be distinguished in the theoretical spectra of the molybdena species with molybdenum in tetrahedral (dioxo species), pentahedral (monooxo species), and octahedral coordination. The experimental NEXAFS spectra exhibit a pronounced double-peak structure in the O 1 s to Mo 4 dO 2 p excitation range of 529 536 eV. Comparison with the present theoretical data gives clear indications that dioxo molybdena species with tetrahedral MoO 4 units can explain the experimental spectrum. This does not fully exclude species with <b>other</b> <b>Mo</b> coordination, like pentahedral. However, the latter are believed to exist in the present samples in much smaller amounts.

40|$|Metaheuristic {{algorithms}} {{have been}} used successfully {{in a number of}} data mining contexts and specifically in the production of classification rules. Classification rules describe a class of interest or a subset of this class, and as such may also be used as an aid in prediction. The production and selection of classification rules for a particular class of the database {{is often referred to as}} partial classification. Since partial classification rules are often evaluated according to a number of conflicting objectives, the generation of such rules is a task that is well suited to a multi-objective (MO) metaheuristic approach. In this paper we discuss how to adapt well known MO algorithms for the task of partial classification. Additionally, we introduce a new MO algorithm for this task based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP). GRASP has been applied to a number of problems in combinatorial optimization, but it has very seldom been used in a MO setting, and generally only through repeated optimization of single objective problems, using either linear combinations of the objectives or additional constraints. The approach presented takes advantage of some specific characteristics of the data mining problem being solved, allowing for the very effective construction of a set of solutions that form the starting point for the local search phase of the GRASP. The resulting algorithm is guided solely by the concepts of dominance and Pareto-optimality. We present experimental results for our partial classification GRASP and <b>other</b> <b>MO</b> metaheuristics. These show that such algorithms are generally very well suited to this data mining task and furthermore, the GRASP brings additional efficiency to the search for partial classification rules...|$|E

All substances caused histologically verified injury to the liver, which varied in appearance and severity-depending on the compound and the mouse strain. Responses of P 450 -catalyzed reactions were highly dependent on the toxin and varied between different monooxygenase (MO) reactions and two mouse strains.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{effective}} spin-orbital model derived for the d 9 ions in a three-dimensional perovskite lattice, as in KCuF_ 3, where {{at each site}} the doubly degenerate eg orbitals contain a single hole. The model describes the superexchange interactions that depend on the pattern of orbitals occupied. We present the ground state properties of this model, depending on the splitting between the eg orbitals E_z, and the Hund's rule coupling in the excited d 8 states, J_H. The classical phase diagram consists of six magnetic phases which all have different orbital ordering: two antiferromagnetic (AF) phases with G-AF order and either x 2 -y 2 or 3 z 2 -r 2 orbitals occupied, two phases with mixed orbital (MO) patterns and A-AF order, and two <b>other</b> <b>MO</b> phases with either C-AF or G-AF order. All of them become degenerate at the multicritical point M=(E_z,J_H) =(0, 0). Using a generalization of linear spin-wave theory we study both the transverse excitations which are spin-waves and spin-and-orbital-waves, {{as well as the}} longitudinal (orbital) excitations. The transverse modes couple to each other, and the spin-and-orbital-wave turns into a soft mode near the M point. Therefore, quantum corrections to the long-range-order parameter are drastically increased near the orbital degeneracy, and classical order is suppressed in a crossover regime between the G-AF and A-AF phases in the (E_z,J_H) plane. This behavior is reminiscent of that found in frustrated spin models, and we conclude that orbital degeneracy provides a new and physically realizable mechanism which stabilizes a spin liquid ground state due to inherent frustration of magnetic interactions. We also point out that such a disordered magnetic phase is likely to be realized in LiNiO_ 2. Comment: 33 pages, 19 figure...|$|E
