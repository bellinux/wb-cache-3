5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within {{a block or}} two of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Their bodies were carried <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol.

5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E

25|$|The north-side Pueblo {{is said to}} be one of {{the most}} photographed and painted {{buildings}} in North America. It is the largest multistoried Pueblo structure still existing. It is made of adobe walls that are often several feet thick. Its primary purpose was for defense. Up to as late as 1900, access to the rooms on lower floors was by ladders on the <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof, and then down an inside ladder. In case of an attack, outside ladders could easily be pulled up.|$|E
25|$|One early {{attempt at}} {{lengthening}} the playing {{time should be}} mentioned. At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device. As these were played from the <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed. This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the Philips Laser Disc.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the question of}} the directionality of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left directionality, if reading proceeds from the <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right directionality in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.|$|E
25|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers a day later. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, there was dispute over {{how best to}} repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle. Thus, Muhammad led his force <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain of Uhud (where the Meccans had camped) and fought the Battle of Uhud on March 23.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 December 2009, during the December 2009 European snowfall, five London-bound Eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel, {{trapping}} 2,000 passengers for approximately 16 hours, during the coldest temperatures in eight years. A Eurotunnel spokesperson explained that snow had evaded the train's winterisation shields, and the transition from cold air <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tunnel's warm atmosphere had melted the snow, resulting in electrical failures. One train was turned back before reaching the tunnel; two trains were hauled {{out of the tunnel}} by Eurotunnel Class 0001 diesel locomotives. The blocking of the tunnel led to the implementation of Operation Stack, the transformation of the M20 motorway into a linear car park.|$|E

A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen metres north {{there was}} another square {{enclosure}} (17 x 17 metres) dedicated to Zeus Meilichios (Honey-sweet Zeus) and Pasikrateia (Persephone), much of which remains, {{but it is not}} easy to understand the various structures, which were built at the end of the fourth century BC. It consists of an enclosure wall surrounded by various types of column on two sides (part of a Hellenistic portico), a small prostyle temple in antis (5.22 x 3.02m) at the back of the enclosure with monolithic Doric columns, but an ionic entablature, and two others in the centre of the enclosure. <b>Outside,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, the pious dedicated many small steles topped by images of the divine pair (two faces, one male and one female) made with shallow incisions.

The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades made a combined attack on Tel el Saba, after the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had cut the road north from Beersheba to Hebron. At 15:00 the same day, the New Zealanders attacked and captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns with a bayonet charge, while the retreating Turkish soldiers were pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Chaytor's troops were now in possession of Tel el Saba. At 15:30, orders were issued for the final assault on Beersheba; the 1st Light Horse Brigade was tasked with capturing a line from a prominent mound <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beersheba mosque.

25|$|Paleontologists have {{traditionally}} identified avian digits as I-II-III. They {{argue that the}} digits of birds number I-II-III, just as those of theropod dinosaurs do, by the conserved phalangeal formula. The phalangeal count for archosaurs is 2-3-4-5-3; many archosaur lineages have a reduced number of digits, but have the same phalangeal formula in the digits that remain. In other words, paleontologists assert that archosaurs of different lineages tend to lose the same digits when digit loss occurs, from the <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside. The three digits of dromaeosaurs, and Archaeopteryx have the same phalangeal formula of I-II-III as digits I-II-III of basal archosaurs. Therefore, the lost digits would be V and IV. If this is true, then modern birds would also possess digits I-II-III. Also, one research team has proposed a frame-shift in the digits of the theropod line leading to birds (thus making digit I into digit II, II to III, and so forth).|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a Last Man Standing match between Edge and Chris Benoit. The match started out with Benoit getting the upper hand.

Benoit then performed multiple German suplexes on Edge, which sent Edge <b>outside</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. Benoit dived through the ropes, but was met with a trash can lid to the face. Edge hit a superplex on Benoit through a trash can. Edge grabbed a ladder and dragged it into the ring, only to get a German suplex off of the ladder. Benoit missed a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} the ladder, Edge grabbed the Money in the Bank briefcase, but was caught in the Crippler Crossface. Edge got out of the Crippler Crossface and performed an Edgecution on Benoit on the briefcase. Benoit reached his feet at nine, only to get speared by Edge.
