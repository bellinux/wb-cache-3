The newly formed Ladd Estate Company converted the depressed company town into a prestigious suburb complete with country club, golf course, polo field, and even worked to rename the harsh-sounding Sucker Lake to Oswego Lake. The company existed as a shell until 1960, when in its final act, it deeded its powerhouse and dams to lake shareholders.|$|E

5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.|$|E

The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887.

5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|From 1760 to 1761, Hancock {{lived in}} England while {{building}} relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually {{took over the}} House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763. He {{became a member of}} the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens. When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, Jennings was {{appointed}} {{as a federal}} commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), {{who lived in the}} northern and central parts of Indiana. The Treaty of St. Mary's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more parcels of land, which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement. The appointment created a crisis in Jennings's political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state's governor, Jennings's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor's office when he accepted the federal appointment.|$|E

5|$|Kanaʻina {{acted as}} {{trustee of the}} royal lands that had been {{inherited}} by his wife while his son was a minor, and after his son's death. When Kanaina died, the court appointed nine trustees, six of which would {{take part in the}} militia that overthrew the monarchy and also take part in the new provisional government. Dole himself had been on the record as supporting the break up of crown lands to promote American style farming in his newspaper in 1872. Various lawsuits ensued over the property including a suit questioning the validity of the will due to Lunalilo being under the guardianship of his father when he made it out. Lunalilo had requested in his will to use the estate to fund a charity. The trustees favored splitting up the estate by selling it off, while others claimed the value of land was underestimated, and an endowment to run the charity could have been funded by lease income. For example, Kanaʻina leased (and later his heirs would sell) thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of land on the island of Hawaii to businessman (and son of missionaries) William Herbert Shipman.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making millions <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support {{for the construction of}} the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands <b>of</b> <b>acres</b> of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E
