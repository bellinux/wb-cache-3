Many injuries caused by prolonged exposure to low concentrations of mustard might have been reduced by bathing or a change of clothes.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the fatty acid content, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of hydro-methanolic extract of Adonis wolgensis L. (A. wolgensis L.) growing wild in north of Iran. Materials and Methods: Oils of A. wolgensis L. was obtained by means of Soxhlet apparatus from leaves and stems. Methyl esters were derived from the <b>oily</b> <b>mixtures</b> by trans-esterification process and were analyzed by GC/FID and GC/MS systems. Phenolic compounds extraction was done with aqueous methanol (90 %). This extract was investigated for antioxidant activity using DPPH radical scavenging and reducing power methods and was also tested against a panel of microorganisms. Results: Linolenic acid (45. 83 %) and oleic acid (47. 54 %) were the most abundant fatty acids in leaves and stems, respectively. Hydro-methanolic extract with the high amount of total phenolics (9. 20 ± 0. 011 mg GAE per dry matter) was the potent antioxidant in the assays. Results obtained from measurements of MIC for extract, indicated that E. coli, S. aureus, and S. enteritidis were the most sensitive microorganisms tested, but no activity was observed against Gram-positive microorganism (B. subtilis). Conclusion: The results obtained from the present study indicated that the oil of A. wolgensis leaves and stems contained a high source of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

METHODS: Forty-two Wistar rats were randomly distributed into two groups: control (n= 24) and test (n= 18). Control group was subdivided in 4 subgroups (n= 6) : G 1 : Sham-Water; G 2 : I/R-Water; G 3 : Sham-Isolipidic and G 4 : I/R-Isolipid. The animals received water or a isolipid mixture containing &# 969;- 3 oils (8 : 1 ratio) and &# 969;- 9 /&# 969;- 6 (0. 4 : 1 ratio) by gavage for seven days. Test group included 3 subgroups (n= 6) G 5 : I/R-Mix 1, G: 6 I/R-Mix 2 and G 7 : I/R-Mix 3. Test group animals received <b>oily</b> <b>mixtures</b> of &# 969;- 3 (1. 4 : 1 ratio) and &# 969;- 6 (3. 4 : 1 ratio), differing only in source of &# 969;- 3 : G 5 (alpha-linolenic acid); G 6 (alpha-linolenic, docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids), and G 7 (alpha-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids).

40|$|Background: Selol is an <b>oily</b> <b>mixture</b> of selenitetriacylglycerides {{that was}} {{obtained}} as a semi-synthetic compound containing selenite. Selol is effective against cancerous cells and less toxic to normal cells compared with inorganic forms of selenite. However, Selol’s hydrophobicity hinders its administration in vivo. Therefore, {{the present study}} aimed to produce a formulation of Selol nanocapsules (SPN) and to test its effectiveness against pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (A 549). Results: Nanocapsules were produced through an interfacial nanoprecipitation method. The polymer shell was composed of poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (PVM/MA) copolymer. The obtained nanocapsules were monodisperse and stable. Both free Selol (S) and SPN reduced the viability of A 549 cells, whereas S induced a greater reduction in non-tumor cell viability than SPN. The suppressor effect of SPN was primarily associated to the G 2 /M arrest of the cell cycle, as was corroborated by the down-regulations of the CCNB 1 and CDC 25 C genes. Apoptosis and necrosis were induced by Selol in a discrete percentage of A 549 cells. SPN also increased the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative cellular damage and to the overexpression of the GPX 1, CYP 1 A 1, BAX and BCL 2 genes. Conclusions: This study presents a stable formulation of PVM/MA-shelled Selol nanocapsules and provides the first demonstration that Selol promotes G 2 /M arrest in cancerous cells...|$|E
30|$|The {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{analysis of}} the fluorescent nanocapsules and fluorescent lipid-core nanocapsules showed that the fluorescence property is maintained after the preparation of these formulations (Figure  6). The difference in the fluorescence intensity on comparing the NC-RS 100 and NC-S 100 formulations with LNC-PCL was expected since the concentration of fluorescent product in these formulations varied (approximately 3.15  mg of product 1 /mL of suspension for NC-RS 100 and NC-S 100 and approximately 1.52  mg of product 1 /mL of suspension for LNC-PCL) (Figure  6). In the undiluted/unextracted samples of the formulations, it was seen that the bathochromic (7  nm) shift for the λmax-em value in the emission spectrum of the NC-S 100 - 1 formulation {{was accompanied by a}} hyperchromic shift (52  a.u.) when compared to the NC-RS 100 - 1 formulation, which contains the same quantity of fluorescent product, probably due to protonation of the amino group of rhodamine B, as the pH of this formulation was the lowest among the formulations (3.50 [*]±[*] 0.09). As previously reported, rhodamine B has an equilibrium of isoforms, lactonic and the zwitterionic isomers [34]. The zwitterion isomer can be protonated more than once due to the presence of two amino groups [34]. A hypochromic shift was observed in the emission spectra of the undiluted/unextracted samples of the LNC-PCL- 1 (114  a.u.), NC-RS 100 - 1 (230  a.u.), and NC-S 100 - 1 (178  a.u.) formulations compared to the spectrum of the solutions containing the same quantity of the CCT/fluorescent <b>oily</b> product <b>mixture</b> in ACN [solution 1 (1.52  mg/mL) and solution 2 (3.15  mg/mL)] (Figure  6 A,B). Unsurprisingly, {{in the case of the}} samples containing the CCT/fluorescent <b>oily</b> product <b>mixture</b> (Figure  6 C,D), the results for the fluorescence intensity of the diluted/extracted samples of the formulations showed greater similarity when compared to the undiluted/unextracted samples. The previously observed hypochromic shift did not occur and a small hyperchromic shift occurred, especially for NC-RS 100 - 2 (24  a.u.) and NC-S 100 - 2 (27  a.u.). Therefore, these changes in the fluorescence intensity of the undiluted/unextracted samples are probably related to the volume fraction of particles in the dispersed phase of the formulation leading to phenomena such as the inner filter effect, where the presence of other compounds can partially absorb the emission energy, and they were not sufficiently reduced even with the use of a triangular cuvette [35, 36].|$|R

The hexacarbonyls react, either under photolytic or thermolytic conditions, to produce carbon monoxide and <b>oily</b> <b>mixtures</b> of {{products of the}} general formulations, [M(CO) 4 (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 C) ]x, where x varies apparently from 1 – 4. The higher values of x, corresponding to species involving bridging ligands, are more common to the photolysis rather than the thermolysis reactions. Photolysis {{reactions of}} Mo(Co) 6 with increasing amounts of the ligand does not result in the higher substitution products, Mo(Co) 2 (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 2 and Mo(PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 3. The reactions of PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 with the norbornadiene tetracarbonyl complexes of Cr(O), Mo(O), and W(O) produce relatively air-stable chelates of the general formulation, M(Co) 4 (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2). Mo(CO) 4 (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) will react with more PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 to give [Mo(CO) 2 (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 2] 2. A slight excess of PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 also reacts readily with ditoluenemolybdenum (O) displacing toluene to give Mo(PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 3, and air-stable monomer. Analysis of the infrared spectra of these chelates indicates that the ligand fits into a sequence of π–acceptor strength as: PF 33 ̆ePCI 3 PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 23 ̆eRN(PF 2) 23 ̆e 3 ̆ePh 2 PC 2 H 4 PPh 2. NMR spectral parameters for the chelates verify the very strong coordination of the bidentate ligand to the metals. 1, 2 -bis(difluorophosphino) cyclohexane has also been found to react with pentacarbonyliron(O), Fe(Co) 5 and with pentacarbonylmanganese(I) bromide, Mn(CO) 5 Br, in hexane, displacing two moles of carbon monoxide per mole of ligand. The products resulting, (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) Fe(Co) 3, (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 2 Fe(CO), (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) Mn(CO) 3 Br, and (PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2) 2 Mn(CO) Br, are all air-stable solid monomers indicating that the ligand is an effective chelating agent. Analysis of their and nmr spectral data supports the conclusion that PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 functions as a strong π–acceptor and assists in assigning structures. The reactions of PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2 in solution with Co 2 (CO) 8 and the chlorides of Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II) have been investigated. The resultant complexes are not well defined. The characterization of the complexes has given ambiguous results, although the nickel group metal complexes appear to be dimeric. The ligand, 1, 2 -bis(difluorophosphino) ethane, PF 2 C 2 H 4 PF 2, reacts with tetracarbonylnickel(O), Ni(Co) 4, in the gas phase and in solution, to produce carbon monoxide and the polymer, [Ni(PF 2 C 2 H 4 PF 2) 2]x. PF 2 C 2 H 4 PF 2 displaces norbornadiene from (C 7 H 8) Mo(Co) 4 to yield the relatively air-stable complex, Mo(CO) 4 (PF 2 C 2 H 4 PF 2). Analysis of the infrared spectrum of the monomeric complex indicates that the ligand exhibits π–acceptor strength equal to PF 2 C 6 H 10 PF 2...|$|R
40|$|Nonionic {{self-emulsifying}} oil-in-water (O/W) formulations free of Cremophore&# 0174; {{were developed}} as drug delivery vehicles for paclitaxel. The surfactants used included phosphatidylcholine purified from egg yolk (EPC), Tween, and Span. Oils phases were either pure components or blends from benzyl alcohol, 2 -phenylethanol benzyl benzoate, and tributyrin. Among these surfactants, mixtures of EPC and Tween- 80 gave really stable emulsions in proper sizes ranging from 70 to 200 nm, mainly {{depends on the}} ratio of EPC to Tween- 80 and amount of oils. Paclitaxel could be well preserved without any loss in <b>oily</b> stocks, namely <b>mixtures</b> of oils and paclitaxel as well as surfactants, stored at 4 &# 0176;C for more than 8 months. Only gentle mixing on oily stocks with aqueous diluents {{is enough to make}} paclitaxel-contained emulsions. The optimum formulation contains oils from 1 to 3 wt%, Tween- 80 and EPC from 0. 4 to 1. 2 wt%, respectively. Consequently, near 500 ppm of paclitaxel can be contained in emulsions. Moreover, these paclitaxel-containing emulsions are compatible with commonly used injection fluids. No precipitation is observed upon preparation of emulsion from dilution of oily stocks. Negligible cytotoxicity on these emulsions assessed with NIH/ 3 T 3 cells implied their good biocompatibility and promising applications as drug delivery carriers...|$|R
