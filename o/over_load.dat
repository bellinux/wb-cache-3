Trafik Verket (TV), the Swedish Transport Administration, recognized that the current process for estimating traffic volume should be reevaluated, and if possible improved. This degree project uses data from the Bridge Weigh in Motion (BWIM) system to study the actual loads applied to Swedish highways. The axle load spectrum is plotted with the conventional frequency distribution plots, and with a new cumulative distribution approach. The paper introduces the maximum allowable potential vehicle weight MAPVW concept, and uses this visual technique to identify overloads for different vehicle geometries. The paper concludes that for 5 and 6 axle trucks the triple axle is frequently overloaded, while for longer trucks one of the dual axles is often <b>over</b> <b>loaded.</b> The highest <b>over</b> <b>loads</b> tend to be on the driving axle, suggesting incorrect loading procedures...|$|R

The main difference between Type 271IIIA and Type 271III from which Type 271IIIA is developed from is that the displacement of Type 271IIIA when fully loaded has increased by a third to 800 tons, and hence becoming a LSM. Armament was greatly reduced to two Type 69 twin 14.5 mm MG, while speed is also reduced to 15 kt. The number of crew is almost doubled to 56 due {{to the need to}} handle more complex machinery. To accommodate the larger size, a pair of more powerful version of Chinese license produced MAN SE 8L20/27 diesel engine have been installed, each with 1142 hp.

5000|$|Following {{the belief}} that {{individual}} vaccines caused autism {{was the idea of}} vaccine overload, which claims that too many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immune system and lead to adverse effects. [...] Vaccine overload became popular after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program accepted the case of nine year old Hannah Poling. Hannah had encephalopathy putting her on the autism spectrum disorder, which was believed to have worsened after getting multiple vaccines at nineteen months old. There have been multiple cases reported similar to this one, which led to he belief that vaccine <b>over</b> <b>load</b> caused autism. However, scientific studies show that vaccines do not overwhelm the immune system. In fact, conservative estimates predict that the immune system can respond to thousands of viruses simultaneously. It is known that vaccines constitute {{only a tiny fraction of}} the pathogens already naturally encountered by a child in a typical year. Common fevers and middle ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines do. Other scientific findings support the idea that vaccinations, and even multiple concurrent vaccinations, do not weaken the immune systemor compromise overall immunity because autism is not an immune-mediated disease.|$|E

For the evaluation of iron <b>over</b> <b>load</b> liver toxicity method was daily treatment of C. papaya extract on the 5 th day iron load was induced. The animals were sacrificed by light ether anesthesia and it was dissected.

The daily administration of aqueous leaf extract of C. papaya at doses of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight to iron <b>over</b> <b>load</b> liver toxicity methods were significantly reduced in a dose dependent manner. However, no change observed in the normal animals at all the doses studied.

Such antioxidant activity of Carica papaya might be responsible for its importance in traditional medicine for the treatment of various disorders...|$|E

The result indicates that the structural stress and the deflection under heavy load are greater than they are under the standard load. When the vehicle is <b>over</b> <b>load</b> by 100 ％, the tensile stress of subbase is close to the allowable tensile stress.

30|$|In an {{electric}} power system, over current or excess current {{is a situation}} where the value larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat which leads to the risk of fire or damage to equipment [5 – 7]. Possible causes for over current include short circuit, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. Fuses, circuit breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of over current. Over current protection also includes the protection against <b>over</b> <b>loads</b> and this is most widely used protection. <b>Over</b> <b>loading</b> of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on insulation class and material. Over current protection against overload is generally provided by thermal relays. Over current protection also includes protection against short-circuit. Short circuits may leads to phase faults, earth faults or winding faults. Short circuit currents are generally several times more than full load current. Hence fast fault clearance is always desirable at the time of short-circuits.|$|R
