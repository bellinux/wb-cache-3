The device may be electronic, mechanical, {{or a combination of}} the two. The noun derives from the Greek words hodós ("path" [...] or [...] "gateway") and métron ("measure"). In countries where Imperial units or US customary units are used, it is sometimes called a mileometer or milometer, the former name especially being prevalent in the United Kingdom and members of the Commonwealth.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} a geometrical method to calculate orbits of comets, especially Halley’s and Hale Bopp’s besides, it discusses the important notion of <b>odograph</b> of cometary movement. Key words: Kepler’s law, Halley’s and Hale-Bopp’s comet, physics and astronomy teaching. RESUMO. Órbitas aproximadas de cometas. Este artigo apresenta um método geométrico para calcular órbitas de cometas, especialmente aquelas dos cometas Halley e Hale-Bopp, discutindo ainda a importante noção de odógrafa de um movimento cometário. Palavras-chave: leis de Kepler, cometas Halley e Hale-Bopp, ensino de física e astronomia. In {{the present article}} we will develop a geometrical technique based on the second law of Kepler (Law of Areas). Basically it consists of a reproduction of triangles of the same area on an ellipsis from an original triangle. Method of triangles in ellipsi...|$|E
