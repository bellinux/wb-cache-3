The dark brown upper forewings are marked with relatively small white markings but can usually be separated from the <b>olive</b> <b>skipper</b> (Pyrgus serratulae) by a c-shaped white mark close to the costa and the reddish-brown, not olive green, colour of the under hindwings, with a large square pale spot close to the margin. The wingspan is 26-28 mm. The adults are on the wing from June to August.|$|E
