Completed in 1917, the building is adjacent to Temple Square, between the Joseph Smith Memorial Building and the Lion House, on South Temple Drive. It differs from the Church <b>Office</b> <b>Building</b> <b>in</b> that it is much smaller and furnishes offices for the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It also houses offices for other general authorities and their personal staff.|$|E

5|$|As a lobbyist, Romney {{frequently}} competed {{on behalf}} of the aluminum industry against the copper industry, and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly.

5|$|The building's {{original}} {{design in the}} modernist New Objectivity style {{was the subject of}} a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig. On its completion, the complex was the largest <b>office</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The IG Farben Building's six square wings retain a modern, spare elegance, despite its mammoth size. It is also notable for its paternoster elevators.|$|E
5|$|The grand {{art deco}} design {{was the work}} of Charles Holden, who was {{appointed}} as architect in March 1931 from a short list which also included Giles Gilbert Scott, Percy Scott Worthington and Arnold Dunbar Smith. In making their choice, Beveridge and the Principal, Edwin Deller, were influenced by the success of Holden's recently completed 55 Broadway, designed as the headquarters for the London Electric Railway and then the tallest <b>office</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> London.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture was also not fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest <b>office</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> London.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{indicated}} {{it wanted to}} consolidate its offices spread out across Philadelphia into one <b>office</b> <b>building.</b> <b>In</b> May 1988, Conrail solicited proposals from developers for a building to house its corporate headquarters. On March 30, 1990, after being sought after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Conrail {{announced that it would}} be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square. With a lead tenant secured, construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990. Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3,000 employees in September of that year. Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper boom of the 1980s, being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an <b>office</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E

5|$|Post-war {{growth in}} {{newspaper}} readership prompted an even larger, $3.5 million expansion in 1964 to fit eight-unit presses {{and a new}} three-story press room {{to the west of}} the printing plant. Four years later, an even larger $6 million addition would use up the last of the surface parking lots on the property's block, building a two-story newsroom clad in reinforced concrete instead of the limestone used on the 1931 building; a skybridge was built across an alley to connect to the older <b>office</b> <b>building.</b> <b>In</b> 1979, the new newsroom was renovated and modernized and a nearby alley was filled and enclosed.|$|E
5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, had a certain {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government <b>office</b> <b>building.</b> <b>In</b> Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Mayor's {{official}} residence is 3 Elliot Terrace, {{located on the}} Hoe.

The Civic Centre municipal <b>office</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> Armada Way became a listed building in June 2007 because of its quality and period features, but has become the centre of a controversy as the council planned for its demolition estimating that it could cost £40m to refurbish it, resulting in possible job losses.|$|E
