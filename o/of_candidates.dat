Only in B- 3, the re-evaluation <b>of</b> a <b>candidate</b> solution in Case B does not decrease the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> solutions. However, in B- 3, x_t ∈ S_t always holds after the re-{{evaluation of}} x_t. As a result, the re-evaluation at the (t+ 1)th evaluation always decreases the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> solutions. This means that the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> solutions can be always decreased by iterating the re-evaluation twice.|$|R

30|$|The {{influence}} of the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> points <b>of</b> track points on time complexity: In this experiment, the number of points {{to ensure that the}} trajectory remains unchanged and the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> points were used by changing only the trace points to analyze the impact of its running time; it was found that with {{the increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> points, with the increase in the running time, and when the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> points is over 5, the running time surges. If the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> point values is too small, it will lead to lower matching accuracy. Therefore, in this algorithm, the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> points that the trajectory point has at most is determined as 5 by combining the running time and the matching precision.|$|R
30|$|In Ishibuchi et al. (2014 b), one <b>of</b> six <b>candidate</b> {{operators}} {{was selected}} to generate a single solution. Other specifications <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> operators can be possible. For example, we can use a sequence of operators such as “crossover & mutation” and “mutation & mutation” as a single candidate operator to generate a new solution. In this manner, we can increase the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> operators for generating a solution. It is also possible to decrease the number <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> operators by removing a specific operator (e.g., crossover). In this paper, we examine {{the relation between the}} specification <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> operators and the performance of designed algorithms.|$|R

The data were obtained by using likert scala model questionnaires, test, and portfolio.

40|$|Abstract: Research on {{the effect}} <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> sex on voting {{behaviour}} has found mixed results. In some countries, in some elections, candidate sex {{has been found to}} influence voting behaviour but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are not fully understood. We argue that in the British context the issue <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> sex has become politicised by party strategies relating to the selection <b>of</b> women <b>candidates.</b> Controversy over mechanisms to improve women's representation raises the salience <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> sex in the public mind and divides opinion on whether women better represent women's interests. Accordingly, British Conservative party leader David Cameron's attempts to improve the representation of women in the Parliamentary Conservative party in 2010 made the issue <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> sex particularly electorally salient and also made it the first election where both main parties fielded substantial numbers <b>of</b> women <b>candidates</b> in winnable seats. Given this increase in the supply and salience <b>of</b> women <b>candidates,</b> 2010 provides a unique opportunity in the British case to model the effect <b>of</b> <b>candidate</b> sex on vote choice. We show that attitudes towards the descriptive representation of women {{had a significant impact on}} whether women supported women candidates in 2010...|$|R
