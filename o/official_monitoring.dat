40|$|In France, the {{sampling}} strategy for the <b>official</b> <b>monitoring</b> of lipophilic phycotoxins in bivalve shellfish relies on the definition of risk areas and high risk periods, during which a systematic weekly analysis of toxins in shellfish is performed. Since 2010, high risk periods are defined as follows: the occurrence of one result above the European regulatory limit (160 μg equivalent okadaic acid/kg shellfish) over the last 3 years leads to that month being considered a high risk period. This definition was established according to a statistical analysis of the <b>official</b> <b>monitoring</b> results for the period 2003 - 2008, based on the mouse bioassay (MBA) as the official analytical method. As of the 1 st January 2010, the MBA {{has been replaced by}} LC-MS/MS.

40|$|Oilseed rape {{is known}} to persist in arable fields because {{of its ability to}} develop {{secondary}} seed dormancy in certain agronomic and environmental conditions. If conditions change, rapeseeds are able to germinate up to 10 years later to build volunteers in ensuing crops. Extrapolations of experimental data acted on the assumption of persistence periods for more than 20 years after last harvest of rapeseed. Genetically-modified oilseed rape—cultivated widely in Northern America since 1996 —is assumed not to differ from its conventional form in this property. Here, experimental data are reported from <b>official</b> <b>monitoring</b> activities that verify these assumptions. At two former field trial sites in Saxony-Anhalt genetically-modified herbicide-resistant oilseed rape volunteers are found up to fifteen years after harvest.
