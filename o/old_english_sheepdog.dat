5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdog</b> type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdog</b> in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles and Evans flew to Greece in late 1967, with {{encouragement}} from Greek-born [...] "Magic Alex", {{the director of}} Apple Electronics, to buy an island {{or a group of}} islands. The general idea was that The Beatles would live on the islands in their own separate homes, but would be connected to each other by tunnels leading to a central dome. Evans and his family were included in the plan, but it was abandoned as being unworkable after McCartney refused to participate. As McCartney had no housekeeper in 1967, Evans moved in with him at 7 Cavendish Avenue, St John's Wood, which is near Abbey Road Studios. It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdog,</b> Martha, although Evans often complained about the dog fouling the beds.

Hoggle flees in a cowardly fashion while Sarah befriends Ludo. After another riddle, she loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who gives him a peach and instructs him {{to give it to}} Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to lead her out of the maze. Sarah is assaulted by a group of creatures called Fireys with detachable body parts who try to remove her head, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and Jareth magically sends them to the Bog of Eternal Stench as punishment, where they reunite with Ludo. Sarah, Hoggle, and Ludo meet a guard of the bridge out of the swamp named Sir Didymus, an anthropomorphic fox, and his <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdog</b> [...] "steed" [...] named Ambrosius. After Ludo howls and summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, Didymus joins the group (her three new friends are just like some of the toys in her room). After the group gets hungry, Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and begins to lose her memories. She has a dream where Jareth comes to her at a masquerade ball, proclaiming his love for her, but she begins to remember and escapes, falling into a junkyard. After an old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her and her memory is jogged, she is rescued by Ludo and Didymus, and they are right outside Goblin City near Jareth's castle. They are confronted by the gate guard, but Hoggle bravely comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.|$|E
2500|$|The dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and {{the modern}} day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first {{recognised}} the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954. Related breeds are the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Owczarek Nizinny), the <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdog,</b> the Briard, the Bergamasco Shepherd (Cane da pastore Bergamasco) and the Old German Sheepdog (Schafspudel), {{all of which are}} small versions of the [...] "mountain type" [...] herding and livestock guardian dogs.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that ranchers who use <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdogs</b> as working dogs for the herding and {{protection}} of their sheep will often dock their dogs for the same reason they dock their sheep. It is done for sanitary purposes; docking prevents the tail from matting down to the body due to brambles or body waste. It also makes shearing easier and it is common to run the dogs through to the shearers after the sheep are shorn.|$|R

40|$|A 3 {{year old}} spayed female Doberman Pinscher {{presented}} {{with a history of}} chronic urinary incontinence since 3 months of age. She was initially managed on PPA (Phenylpropanolamine) and DES (diethylstilbestrol) but had become refractory to medical management. Diagnostics revealed a caudally displaced urinary bladder (pelvic bladder), cranially positioned ureters, and a persistent hymen. A percutaneously controlled static hydraulic urethral sphincter was placed around the proximal urethra to increase mechanical urethral resistance. Urinary incontinence is a common problem in the adult spayed female dog, with a reported incidence of up to 20 %. The mechanism underlying the development of incontinence is complex and multi-factorial. A functional weakness in the urethral closure mechanism following ovariectomy, a condition known as urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence, is thought to be a primary component. Affected animals are most commonly middle aged, medium to large breed dogs, with Rotweilers, Doberman Pinschers, <b>Old</b> <b>English</b> <b>Sheepdogs</b> being overrepresented.
