60|$|This, then, was {{the summary}} of his reflections. (1) That {{to save the}} situation, within three months or so he must be united in holy matrimony with Lysbeth van Hout. (2) That if it proved {{impossible}} to remove the young man, Dirk van Goorl, from his path by <b>overmatching</b> him in the lady's affections, or by playing on her jealousy (Query: Could a woman be egged into becoming jealous of that flounder of a fellow and into marrying some one else out of pique?), stronger measures must be adopted. (3) That such stronger measures should consist of inducing the lady to save her lover from death by uniting herself in marriage with one who for her sake would do violence to his conscience and manipulate the business. (4) That this plan would be best put into execution by proving the lover to be a heretic, but if unhappily this could not be proved because he was not, still he must figure in that capacity for this occasion only. (5) That meanwhile it would be well to cultivate the society of Mynheer van Goorl as much as possible, first {{because he was a}} person with whom, under the circumstances, he, Montalvo, would naturally wish to become intimate, and secondly, because he was quite certain to be an individual with cash to lend.|$|E
50|$|<b>Over{{matching}}</b> is matching for {{an apparent}} confounder that {{actually is a}} result of the exposure. True confounders are associated with both the exposure and the disease, but if the exposure itself leads to the confounder, or has equal status with it, then stratifying by that confounder will also partly stratify by the exposure, resulting in an obscured relation of the exposure to the disease. <b>Overmatching</b> thus causes statistical bias.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent review}} by McDowell reveals that Herrnstein's {{original}} equation fails to accurately describe concurrent-schedule data under a substantial range of conditions.Three deviations from matching have been observed: undermatching, <b>overmatching</b> and bias. Undermatching {{means that the}} response proportions are less extreme than the law predicts. Undermatching can happen if subjects too often switch between the two response options, a tendency that may be strengthened by reinforcers that happen to occur just after a subject switches. A changeover delay {{may be used to}} reduce the effectiveness of such post-switch reinforcers; typically, this is a 1.5 second interval after a switch when no reinforcer is presented. <b>Overmatching</b> is the opposite of undermatching, and is less common. Here the subjects response proportions are more extreme than reinforcement proportions. <b>Overmatching</b> may occur if there is a penalty for switching. A final deviation is bias, which occurs when subjects spend more time on one alternative than the matching equation predicts. This may happen if a subject prefers a certain environment, area in a laboratory or method of responding.|$|E

5000|$|... 1957-1958 was {{the first}} season that interleague play started in Venezuelan {{baseball}} history. Valencia, with Otero at the helm, captured its third Venezuelan League title in four years. The team later defeated the Rapiños de Occidente of the rival Western League, {{en route to the}} championship and a trip to the 1958 Caribbean Series. Once again, Cueche was a mainstay for the Industriales, leading the team's starters with an 8-4 record, a 3.84 ERA, and 109⅔ innings of work in the regular season. He also recorded the third-best ERA in the league after Charlie Beamon (2.49) and Ramón Monzant (2.55), having one fewer win that Beamon and Monzant, while his seven complete games were only surpassed by the 11 of Monzant. Besides, he posted a best team average of [...]345 as a two-way player, <b>overmatching</b> teammates Lou Limmer (.308), Lenny Green (.306), Jim Frey (.304) and Earl Battey (.299). He then went 4-0 in his four playoff starts, completing all of them, including a 10-inning victory and a 1.70 ERA in 37 innings. Nonetheless, Cueche was vulnerable in the 1958 Series, as he went 0-1 with a 3.95 ERA in two starts and one relief appearance. It was his last performance in the Caribbean tournament.|$|E

40|$|Concurrent variable-interval two-minute and six-minute {{schedules}} {{were arranged}} while the fixed-ratio changeover requirement was varied among one, two, and four responses. A four-response requirement produced <b>overmatching</b> in the response and time data. A one-response requirement produced consistent undermatching {{in the time}} data but mixed results in the response data. The two-response requirement showed undermatching in the time data and <b>overmatching</b> in the response data. The results are discussed in relation to previous research using changeover requirements of five and ten responses, which produced clear tendencies toward <b>overmatching,</b> especially with response data. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} matching is not a unique result, and that undermatching or <b>overmatching</b> can be produced by continuous variation of the changeover requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{performance}} under concurrent variable-interval reinforcement schedules that takes as its starting point the hypothetical “burst” structure of operant responding is presented. Undermatching and <b>overmatching</b> {{are derived from}} two separate, and opposing, tendencies. The first {{is a tendency to}} allocate a certain proportion of response bursts randomly to a response alternative without regard for the rate of reinforcement it provides, others being allocated according to the simple matching law. This produces undermatching. The second is a tendency to prolong response bursts that have a high probability of initiation relative to those for which initiation probability is lower. This process produces <b>overmatching.</b> A model embodying both tendencies predicts (1) that undermatching will be more common than <b>overmatching,</b> (2) that <b>overmatching,</b> when it occurs, will tend to be of limited extent. Both predictions are consistent with available data. The model thus accounts for undermatching and <b>overmatching</b> deviations from the matching law in terms of additional processes added on to behavior allocation obeying the simple matching relation. Such a model thus enables processes that have been hypothesized to underlie matching, such as some type of reinforcement rate or probability optimization, to remain as explanatory mechanisms even though the simple matching law may not generally be obeyed...|$|E
40|$|Three pigeons responded {{for food}} {{reinforcement}} on multiple variable-interval schedules {{in which the}} total consumption of food was entirely determined by the subjects' interaction with the schedules (a closed economy). The finding of <b>overmatching,</b> where response allocation between components is more extreme than the distribution of reinforcers, was reconfirmed. Generalized-matching sensitivity decreased from <b>overmatching</b> to undermatching values typical of conventional multiple schedules when food deprivation was increased by decreasing session duration, but not when deprivation was increased by decreasing overall reinforcer rate. Sensitivity also increased from undermatching to <b>overmatching</b> as session duration increased from 100 min to 24 hr, while deprivation was held constant by decreasing overall reinforcer rate. These results can {{be understood in terms}} of increases in the value of extraneous reinforcers relative to food reinforcers as deprivation decreases or as the economy for extraneous reinforcers becomes more closed. However, no published quantitative expression of the effects of extraneous reinforcers is entirely consistent with the results...|$|E

40|$|Considerable Naval and {{industrial}} experience {{dating from the}} explosion bulge studies of Pellini and Hartbower in the early 1950 s has indicated the engineering utility of using weld metal having strength greater than the plates being joined (<b>overmatching).</b> This practice shields the weld region, which typically has lower toughness than the plate and is often the site of defects, from the high strains that develop during an overload. This practical advantage, coupled with the ease of achieving overmatch in lower strength steel alloys (80 ksi yield strength or less) has led to codification of <b>overmatching</b> as a requirement in most structural design codes and fabrication specifications. However, <b>overmatching</b> has certain economic and technical disadvantages which undermatched (weld metal strength less than plate strength) systems might alleviate. Examples of undermatch benefits discussed in the literature include reduction of the preheat needed to avoid hydrogen cracking and increase of weld metal deposition rate relative to overmatched practice. Such changes could reduce the need to hold electrodes at an elevated temperature prior to use, extend the welder'...|$|E
40|$|Since {{foraging}} {{in nature}} {{can be viewed}} as instrumental behavior, choice between sources of food, known as “patches,” {{can be viewed as}} choice between instrumental response alternatives. Whereas the travel required to change alternatives deters changeover in nature, the changeover delay (COD) usually deters changeover in the laboratory. In this experiment, pigeons were exposed to laboratory choice situations, concurrent variable-interval schedules, that were standard except for the introduction of a travel requirement for changeover. As the travel requirement increased, rate of changeover decreased and preference for a favored alternative strengthened. When the travel requirement was small, the relations between choice and relative reinforcement revealed the usual tendencies toward matching and undermatching. When the travel requirement was large, strong <b>overmatching</b> occurred. These results, together with those from experiments in which changeover was deterred by punishment or a fixed-ratio requirement, deviate from the matching law, even when a correction is made for cost of changeover. If one accepted an argument that the COD is analogous to travel, the results suggest that the norm in choice relations would be <b>overmatching.</b> This <b>overmatching,</b> however, might only be the sign of an underlying strategy approximating optimization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of very narrow weld bead and highly strength <b>overmatching</b> on the fracture toughness of laser beam welded components are investigated. This study {{focuses on the}} difference of plastic constraint in fracture toughness specimen (3 -point bend specimen, 3 PB) and structural components with crack in the weld metal. The equivalent crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) ratio, β, for the correction of CTOD toughness for constraint loss in structural components is numerically analyzed. The narrowness of weld bead induces constraint loss by plastic deformation in the base metal, both the 3 PB and structural components. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} the wide plate with shallow crack, the highly strength <b>overmatching</b> elevates the opening stress. Therefore, it is found that the β increase with increasing strength mismatch ratio. The influence of highly strength <b>overmatching</b> on β is important for assessment of fracture performance of laser beam welded component. The applicability of β to correction of critical CTOD in laser beam welded components is discussed. The fracture toughness tests with the 3 PB and tension panel (edge through-crack panel) of the laser beam welded joints were conducted at a low temperature in the brittle fracture range. It is indicated that β can be applied to the CTOD toughness correction in laser beam welded component...|$|E

40|$|Police {{officers}} and other {{personnel in the}} UK routinely wear body armour that provides protection from specific threats. Typically, 'soft' armours, usually formed from multiple layers of fabric, can protect wearers from fragmentation and low velocity (handgun) ballistic threats, while ‘hard’ armours, formed from ceramic and composite plates, offer protection from high velocity (rifle) threats. Protection from stab and/or slash attack is predominantly provided by utilising chain mail and laminated solutions. The question has been raised however, {{of what would happen}} when armour is overmatched with a greater threat than it is designed to protect against. A limited number of studies have been published in the open source literature regarding the <b>overmatching</b> of soft body armour. This research aims to increase the understanding of <b>overmatching,</b> by investigating the effect of both i) soft fabric body armour designed to protect from handgun ammunition being challenged by high velocity rifle projectiles and ii) knife and spike resistant armour protecting against low velocity handgun projectiles. A subsection of the research considered three tissue simulants in order to find the most suitable for investigating the effects of <b>overmatching</b> armour. A method for recording the damage produced in the simulants was also developed; from which comparison of damage to different targets was possible. Following the tissue simulant investigation, gelatine blocks 10 % in concentration were selected and used to investigate the <b>overmatching</b> of two types of UK police body armour. Three different arrangements were setup, namely 10 % gelatine blocks 500 mm, 10 % gelatine blocks 250 mm in length, and porcine thoracic walls arranged to simulate a thorax. Testing blocks 500 mm in length was a set-up typical to ballistic investigations; the blocks were capable of capturing the majority of the projectiles’ damage, with the damage produced in both unprotected and protected (on the front face only) targets compared. Based on anthropometric measurements, testing 10 % gelatine blocks 250 mm in size was more representative of a torso sized target. With the blocks smaller, armour was placed on both the front and back face of targets. This is more representative of how armour would be worn in a real life scenario; patrolling UK police officer wearing armour that protects both the front and back of their torso. Finally, the use of porcine samples arranged to simulate both protected and unprotected thoraxes enabled comparisons of the damage seen in homogenous tissue simulants to damage in non-homogenous material typical to those found in the human torso. The outcomes from testing three different targets with two ammunition and armour combinations revealed the effect of <b>overmatching</b> armour is not one that can be generalised and predicted for all <b>overmatching</b> scenarios. The presence of armour on the rear face of targets based on typical measurements of human chest depth, increased the chances of the projectiles tested remaining within the targets. EPSR...|$|E

In rich regions, much cold and heat in conjunction with relatively little wealth (undermatching) and little cold and heat in conjunction with relatively much wealth (<b>overmatching)</b> both are thought to produce less destructive leadership cultures than do approximations of just enough wealth to successfully cope with thermal climate (optimal matching). Avoiding confounding influences of numerous cross-national differences, we tested this tenet using employee survey data gathered in a sample of 191 Norwegian municipalities. Destructive leadership culture is less prevalent in less wealthy regions with more demanding winters and more demanding summers (undermatching) and in more wealthy regions with milder winters and milder summers (<b>overmatching)</b> than in more or less wealthy regions with either more demanding winters and milder summers or more demanding summers and milder winters (optimal matching).
