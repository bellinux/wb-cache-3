30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the trophic {{structure}} of the East China Sea might be controlled by bottom-up processes, and this control is mediated by temperature.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the repair of a {{perforated}} sinus membrane using absorbable collagen membrane {{can be a}} safe and predictable procedure.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> anemia is {{associated}} with 2 -year outcome in patients admitted for AECOPD.|$|R
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> antioxidative {{capacity}} of LM in hippocampus may augment the antiamnesic effects in anterograde amnesia.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{bicarbonate}} levels {{change during}} ICU stay for hypercapnic COPD exacerbation {{could be considered}} as prognostic factor.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the results}} of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{optimization}} of ChOA expression conditions in E. coli significantly enhanced the enzyme productivity by approximately 50 times. The affinity purified ChOA retained the enzyme characteristics as reported previously.|$|E
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> other {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to predict}} resource utilization patterns instead of competition alone, as suggested by neutral theory. Future studies analyzing the mechanisms that structure waterbird communities should include the use of null models to support their conclusions.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{our study}} {{provided}} {{the first evidence}} that BBR could effectively alleviate SEB-induced ALI {{and this may be}} mediated through repressing class I HDAC enzyme. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> BBR may constitute a novel therapeutic modality to prevent SEB-mediated inflammation and ALI.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> laparoscopic {{treatment}} of EOC has very encouraging long-term oncologic outcomes. Further {{studies are needed}} to support this preliminary evidence.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} of <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> discoid lateral meniscus {{is different from}} a normal meniscus in terms of vascularity and disorganization of collagen fibers.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> use of Quixil in total knee {{arthroplasty}} reduces postoperative apparent blood loss, also compared {{with use of}} the Di-deco device.|$|R
30|$|However, {{few studies}} were {{interested}} in acute poisonings and their management. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> acute acenocoumarin poisoning is often not serious if patients were early managed. The administration of vitamin K could be necessary and safety, especially for patients without long-term anticoagulant treatment.|$|E
30|$|Although a {{multitude}} of questions concerning the regulation of dietary carnitine requirements remain to be elucidated, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ploidy significantly affected the energy metabolism, whereas dietary l-carnitine levels altered the carnitine homeostasis, but did not influence energy metabolism in diploid and triploid rainbow trout.|$|E
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the timing}} of maximum BNP {{concentrations}} and the maximum daily fluid balance might parallel in septic patients. However, the peak BNP concentrations tended to follow the maximum daily fluid balance as the patients get older. Thus, BNP cannot be used to estimate the refilling phase.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, {{results of}} <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> TPVB {{combined}} with general anesthesia {{may reduce the}} incidence of postoperative chronic pain for more than 1  year after BCS.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> colimycin {{could be}} a {{first-line}} therapy for VAP in ABMR in our Third World countries due to its efficacy, safety and low cost.|$|R
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{prognostic}} {{impact of}} pre-ICU qSOFA, assessed during the 24 -h period before ICU admission, was small among patients with suspected sepsis (HR 1.35, 95 % CI 0.56 – 3.22). In this study, comprised of high-mortality (29.2 %) patients, 14 % (26 / 185) of patients remained qSOFA-negative {{even at the}} time of ICU admission. Moreover, the difference in in-hospital mortality was small (qSOFA-positive: 30.2 % vs qSOFA-negative: 23.1 %, p[*]=[*] 0.642). Importantly, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the risk of mortality in patients with bloodstream infection, immunosuppression or hematologic malignancy would be difficult to estimate using qSOFA scores. The results of our study may provide important implications for clinicians in early prognostication of patients with suspected sepsis and for developers of sepsis screening systems.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether {{the production of}} an antigen-specific antibody is associated with Neospora caninum-induced bovine abortion, 62 serum samples were tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the recombinant antigens NcSAG 1, NcSRS 2, and NcGRA 7. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> NcGRA 7 would be a new marker for the serodiagnosis of N. caninum infection resulting in abortion...|$|E
30|$|In summary, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the {{bottom-up}} {{control is}} the prevailing mechanism regulating the trophic {{structure of the}} East China Sea. We also demonstrated how temperature and nutrient status influence the abundance of each trophic level. Our study could offer a base in further understating how eutrophication and temperature change may influence the ecosystem of the East China Sea.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{transfer}} of ICU {{to the new}} buildings {{was associated with a}} decrease of Pseudomonas aeroginosa resistance, whereas Acinetobacter spp resistance and ESBL Enterobacteriacae incidence increased.|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: Despite its limitations, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> HS {{might be}} an option for octogenarian and over since an age[*]≥[*] 85  yrs. {{does not seem to}} impact on {{post-operative}} mortality.|$|R
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> P-p 38 MAPK {{expression}} {{were significantly}} associated with clinicopathological factors and PR/HER 2 might association with phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK in different types of breast cancer.|$|R
30|$|In this research, PEI-modified docetaxel-loaded TPGS-b-(PCL-ran-PGA) NPs polyplexed with {{endostatin}} gene {{showed an}} optimizing potential in delivering genes and chemotherapeutic drugs. The co-delivery of endostatin and docetaxel by PEI-modified TPGS-b-(PCL-ran-PGA) NPs significantly inhibited the tumor growth of nude mouse models (even regress 80 % established tumor). In conclusion, <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> PEI-modified TPGS-b-(PCL-ran-PGA) NPs could {{function as an}} optimizing carrier for chemotherapeutic drugs and genetic materials.|$|E
30|$|In a {{pilot study}} of {{simulated}} ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access by emergency physicians, the out-of-plane oblique approach did not reduce the time to aspiration or total number of attempts. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> higher educational level improved success, regardless of approach. Further studies using both the in-plane and out-of-plane oblique approaches for ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access should be performed to fully compare the oblique approach to the traditional transverse and longitudinal techniques.|$|E
30|$|The only {{prospective}} {{pilot study}} that has addressed {{the effect of}} NRT in ICU patients (n[*]=[*] 40) demonstrated no effect of NRT {{on the use of}} sedatives and analgesics or ventilator free days compared with placebo [22]. However, there was a trend towards shorter ICU stay in the NRT group compared with the control group [4.5 (±[*] 3.8) vs 7.0 (±[*] 5.8) days, p[*]=[*] 0.08]. This study and <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> NRT may lead to a shorter ICU and hospital LOS.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} <b>our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{critically}} ill patients on CVVH treated with CI achieved the target level faster than II and consistently keep the vancomycin level within target range.|$|R

30|$|Conclusion <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> setting MAP alarm could enhance {{time within}} a MAP target range and {{therefore}} may prevent patients from pernicious effects of hypotension and {{side effects of}} norepinephrine overdose.|$|R
40|$|Finding {{significant}} contextual features is {{a challenging}} {{task in the}} development of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper investigated a simple method to facilitate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance judgements of retrieved documents. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the agreement on relevance judgements can indicate the effectiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features. The effect of highly agreed documents gives us practical implication for the design of adaptive search models in interactive IR systems...|$|E
30|$|<b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{even though}} the BRICS markets may share similar characteristics, the trading systems lead to very {{heterogeneous}} results. In some countries, trading based on moving averages could not exceed the buy and hold strategy. Therefore, {{there is no clear}} pattern in the historical data that could be used generally across the markets. Although results support that the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis could be rejected, the trading strategy did not lead universally to better results than the gains generated by the buy and hold strategy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDeregulations of EGFR {{endocytosis}} in EGFR-ERK signaling {{are known}} to cause cancers and developmental disorders. Mutations that impaired c-Cbl–EGFR association delay EGFR endocytosis and produce higher mitogenic signals in lung cancer. ROCK, an effector of small GTPase RhoA was shown to negatively regulate EGFR endocytosis via endophilin A 1. A mathematical model was developed to study how RhoA and ROCK regulate EGFR endocytosis. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> over-expressing RhoA as well as ROCK prolonged ERK activation partly by reducing EGFR endocytosis. Overall, our study hypothesized an alternative role of RhoA in tumorigenesis {{in addition to its}} regulation of cytoskeleton and cell motility...|$|E
