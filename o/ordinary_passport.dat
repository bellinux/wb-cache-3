25|$|A Hungarian <b>ordinary</b> <b>passport,</b> with {{visa-free access}} {{to all of the}} world's {{developed}} countries, is a very convenient travel document by international standards. However, it is not as handy as a Hungarian diplomatic passport, which has even less visa restrictions attached to it. Several countries offer visa-free access to holders of a Hungarian diplomatic passport, but not to <b>ordinary</b> <b>passport</b> holders. This is notably the case with China (since 1992), Russia (since 2001). and India (since 2003). As of July 2009, Hungarian diplomats can enter all G8+5 countries without a visa. The Hungarian diplomatic passport holds the distinction of being the only travel document in the world granting such visa-free entry to all G8+5 member states.|$|E
