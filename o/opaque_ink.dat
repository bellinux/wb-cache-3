50|$|Although fake {{currency}} is being printed with precision, the Crime Investigation Department (CID) {{says that they}} can be detected with some effort. Currency printed by local racketeers and foreign racketeers in Pakistan on the behest of its intelligence service Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) can be detected easily as they use the photographic method, hand engraved blocks, lithographic processes and computer colour scanning. In counterfeit notes, the watermark is made by using <b>opaque</b> <b>ink,</b> painting with white solution, stamping with a dye engraved with the picture of Mahatma Gandhi. Then oil, grease or wax is applied to give the picture a translucent feel. In genuine notes, the security thread is incorporated into the paper at the time of manufacture. But in fake notes, the security thread is imitated by drawing a line with a pencil, by printing a line with grey ink, or by using aluminium thread while pasting two thin sheets of paper. Forgers find it difficult to reproduce the same shape of individual numbers again and again with accuracy. The alignment of figures is also difficult to maintain. Spreading of ink, smaller or bigger number, inadequate gaps, and different alignments in numbers should be regarded with suspicion. In counterfeit notes, the printed lines will be broken and there may also be ink smudges.In recent times {{it has been reported that}} FICN match 10 out of 14 security parameters adopted by the Indian government, with suggestions that the highest quality fakes could have only been produced by a nation state.|$|E

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} is {{an established}} industry allowing {{the production of}} electronic components such as resistors, and more complex structures such as solar cells, from functional inks. Composites, a mixture {{of two or more}} materials with different physical and/or chemical properties that combine to create a new material with properties differing from its constituent parts, have been important in areas such as the textile and automotive industries, and are significant in printed electronics as inks for printed circuit components, touch and vapour sensors. Here, the functional performance and physical behaviour of two screen printable multi-component nanocomposite inks, formulated for touch-pressure sensing applications, are investigated. They each comprise a proprietary mixture of electrically conducting and insulating nanoparticles dispersed in an insulating polymer binder, where one is opaque and the other transparent. The <b>opaque</b> <b>ink</b> has a complex surface structure consisting of a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The transparent inks structure is characterised by large aggregates of nanoparticles distributed through the printed layer. Temperature dependent electrical transport measurements under a range of compressive loadings reveal similar non-linear behaviour in both inks, with some hysteresis observed, and this behaviour is linked to the inks structures. A physical model comprising a combination of linear and non-linear conduction contributions, with the linear term attributed to direct connections between conductive particles and the non-linear term attributed to field-assisted quantum tunnelling, has been developed and used successfully to describe the underpinning physical processes behind the unique electrical functionality of the <b>opaque</b> <b>ink</b> and, to a lesser extent, the transparent ink...|$|E

30|$|Most {{text was}} {{executed}} in black carbon-based (infrared <b>opaque)</b> <b>ink,</b> sometimes with red vermilion-based ink text and accents. However, a brown ink was employed for the text {{on all the}} folios examined from a manuscript produced in Iraq in 1224 (Table  1, # 1 – 4). This ink was transparent in infrared and lacked distinctive elements, suggesting used of a natural organic compound. XRF analysis did show slightly more iron in the inked areas {{but not enough to}} confirm iron-gall ink. As the ink lacks the characteristic haloing or cellulose degradation associated with iron-gall ink, it may be another type of brown organic ink. Historical recipes for the manufacture of Persian inks show that these consisted of multi-component mixtures, many of which contained soot and/or iron gall [26, 27]. Distinction between inks produced with different recipes relied on the use of false color infra-red imaging [26], which was not undertaken in this project. Colored inks were rare, although multiple colors of ink were identified in a manuscript currently attributed to late 17 th century Iran, Table  1, # 36, and are discussed below. Other studies have found colored inks on Islamic manuscripts from the 15 th to 17 th centuries to contain malachite, iron gall, red lead, vermilion, ultramarine and a range of yellow and red arsenic sulfides [24, 25].|$|E
40|$|We live in {{a digital}} age. As more of our {{interactions}} are mediated by computers, their visual displays become our windows to the world. Every year, new and `more-realistic' displays bring the world to our fingertips, and we recognize the quaint limits of last year's printers, televisions, and phones. This dissertation pushes display technology on four fronts, each immersing us more deeply in the scene we're shown, letting us forget the display itself. First, we introduce printed photos that respond to ambient light as would the depicted 3 D scene. Shadows and shading in a printed image change to match its new lighting environment. With a 3 D object and a print side by side, a light to their right will casts shadows to the left on both. Shiny, dimpled `Reflectance Paper' - with <b>opaque</b> <b>ink</b> on an overlaid transparency - selectively blocks light from each direction independently. Second, we look to 3 D displays, where stereo glasses funnel different images to each eye. Typical 3 D displays show a confusing double-image to those not wearing stereo glasses. Our 3 D+ 2 DTV gives a 3 D view to those with the glasses, but presents a single, 2 D view to those without. For those without glasses, we cancel {{one of the two}} stereo images with an inverted third image that only they see. Third, we increase the fidelity of mobile displays' power-saving backlight dimming. With maximum brightness reduced, intermediate brightness levels are remapped to preferentially retain detail at strong edges in the image. Fourth, we personalize photography. Displaying photos with content-aware image manipulations and eyetrack-based saliency subtly preserves photographers' intentions as recorded in their eye gaze history. Display technology's relentless evolution enriches our increasingly digitized world. This dissertation's four contributions raise the immersiveness of our digital portals, heightening our view of the world and our communication with one another...|$|E

50|$|Historically, the mandala was {{not created}} with natural, dyed sand, but {{granules}} of crushed coloured stone. In modern times, plain white stones are ground down and dyed with <b>opaque</b> <b>inks</b> {{to achieve the}} same effect. The monks use a special, extremely dense sand in order to limit interference by things like wind or sneezes. Before laying down the sand, the monks assigned to the project will draw the geometric measurements associated with the mandala. The sand granules are then applied using small tubes, funnels, and scrapers, called chak-pur, until the desired pattern over-top is achieved. Sand mandalas traditionally take several weeks to build due to the large amount of work involved in laying down the sand in such intricate detail. It is common that a team of monks will work together on the project, creating one section of the diagram at a time, working from the centre outwards.|$|R

50|$|Monotyping {{is a type}} of printmaking made {{by drawing}} or {{painting}} on a smooth, non-absorbent surface. The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of <b>opaque</b> color. The <b>inks</b> used may be oil based or water based.

40|$|A type {{of black}} printer that only existed in theory {{is now being}} applied in the {{printing}} industry. The process which makes use of this black printer is known as gray-component replacement. Developed from {{the extension of the}} undercolor removal process, the use of gray-component replacement in printing halftone reproductions is said to result in numerous technical and cost benefits. When used to the maximum, the process eliminates one of the three process color inks in a given unit area and prints black ink from highlight to shadow. A problem can result from the use of this process as it applies a greater amount of an <b>opaque</b> black <b>ink</b> in combination with selectively transparent colored inks. Where this black ink overprints {{one or more of the}} three colored inks there will be an increase in unwanted absorption and a decrease in the wanted absorption. The result of such overprinting will be the alteration of the reflectance curve of the reproduction as compared to the original with the result being a shift in hue. An experiment was performed to demonstrate the principles. Several tint patches were printed with the only difference between each patch being the location of black ink overprinting within the tint. It could be seen by visual analysis that a hue shift did occur. Sample tint patches were analyzed by means of a spectrophotometer to objectively describe the visual results...|$|R

Lari's mystical verse, meanwhile, describes the ceremonies of the Hajj and their essence.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In a color {{reproduction}} workflow, spectral prediction models {{are useful for}} establishing the correspondence between colorant sur-face coverages and resulting printed halftone color. Spectral predic-tion models enable calculation of the color gamut and establishment of the color separation tables. Discrete line juxtaposed halftoning, a recently proposed algorithm, {{is characterized by the}} fact that colorants formed by inks and ink superpositions are placed side by side. Juxtaposed halftoning is necessary when printing with special <b>inks</b> such as <b>opaque</b> or metallic <b>inks.</b> In order to predict the color of classical halftones, the Yule–Nielsen modified spectral Neugebauer model is generally used. However, this model may not predict the color of juxtaposed halftones, since the effective surface coverages of colorants and of possible colorant overlaps are unknown. In contrast, the two-by-two dot centering spectral prediction model developed by S. G. Wang enables the reflectance of slightly overlapping colorants to be captured and is therefore appropriate for predicting the color of juxtaposed halftones. Since this model requires a large calibration set, the authors use an estimation technique which predicts more than 90 % of the two-by-two calibration pattern reflectances by measuring less than 10 % of them. For juxtaposed halftoning, the two-by-two dot centering model offers high prediction accuracies and outperforms the different variants of the Yule–Nielsen spectral Neugebauer mode...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{emulsification}} process of lithographic ink and water was conducted to investigate methods for determining the water content of lithographic ink and water emulsions. Experiments using infra-red spectroscopy {{and analysis of the}} hydroxyl and carbonyl absorption bands revealed several variables which must be considered when attempting to use infra-red spectroscopic methods for the determination of the water content of ink emulsions. These factors include the choice of pigment, (either transparent or opaque), the type of cell medium, and methods for dispersing added water into an ink. The initial problem encountered was a lack of reproducibility when attempting to construct a calibration system. The carbonyl absorption band at 1745 cm^- 1 was shown to vary with each sample of emulsion. The intensity of the hydroxyl absorption band at 1645 cm^- 1 was discovered to be erratic between differing samples of ink and water emulsions. This resulted in hydroxyl contents which appeared to be inconsistent with known concentrations of water. The simulation of 2 ̆ 2 on-press 2 ̆ 2 emulsification, as it occurs in the lithographic process on an offset press, is a very important factor. The importance of added water attaining the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion is the prime criterion for valid and reproducible data obtained from infra-red spectroscopic analysis. This is accomplished by applying sufficient forces to generate an adequate rate of shear on the ink as added water is introduced into the emulsification process. The two modes of vibration of a water molecule were studied utilizing data obtained from infra-red spectra. The O-H stretching mode exhibited at 3400 cm^- 1 proved to be more sensitive to changes in water content of an ink than the bending mode exhibited at 1645 cm^- 1. Valid data used to construct a calibration system for water content determination of lithographic emulsions relies on the elimination of any moisture contamination of the cell medium used in the optics system of an infra-red spectrophotometer. Likewise, use of a transparent pigmented ink yields a continuous spectra. An <b>opaque</b> pigmented <b>ink</b> causes excessive light scattering resulting in off-scale deflections of absorption bands. Present methods of laboratory simulation of the emulsification of water into an ink were investigated to determine the optimum system which would yield stable ink and water emulsions in which the added water would assume the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion. Factors such as the rate of shear and time of dispersion were studied and found to significantly influence the formation of stable lithographic emulsions. Finally, the behavior of added water on the tack of an ink was also investigated. The tack values of a 2 ̆ 2 dry 2 ̆ 2 ink were closely monitored for extended periods of time. Immediate changes in tack were noted and recorded upon the addition of water. The addition of water to an ink in which the tack had apparently stabilized, effectively lowered the tack to the point where a homogeneous, stable emulsion was possible...|$|R
