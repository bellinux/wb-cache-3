5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> He immediately called the police.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E

Police treated the deaths as homicides, though they had not yet determined whether the victims had been murdered.|$|E

25|$|After {{a series}} of warning letters, District Auditor Skinner was invited to Islington town hall on 8 May to meet the council leaders and discuss his draft report on Islington. Skinner found that the streets outside were full of {{thousands}} of demonstrators supporting the council, which the councillors insisted had arrived spontaneously. Despite police protection he was kicked when attempting to leave after the meeting, {{and had to be}} smuggled out lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of a police car covered by coats. An application for an emergency debate in the House of Commons by Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn was turned down that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Pacheco {{repeatedly}} {{went into}} the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, through it to secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of a car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a walkie-talkie from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys' living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained {{that he had been}} set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was on vacation and that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub's research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.|$|E
500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto {{the back seat and}} brushed against [...] He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased." [...] Hodgson's confessions were {{a significant part of the}} case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E

To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's cab, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by Nouvelle Vague filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard {{due to the fact}} the crew didn't have the time nor the money to do [...] "traditional things." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{uncertainty}} about {{the circumstances under which}} the book was found. One newspaper article refers to the book being found about a week or two before the body was found. Former South Australian Police detective Gerry Feltus (who dealt with the matter as a cold case), reports that the book was found [...] "just after that man was found on the beach at Somerton". The timing is significant as the man is presumed, based on the suitcase, to have arrived in Adelaide the day before he was found on the beach. If the book was found one or two weeks before, it suggests that the man had visited previously or had been in Adelaide for a longer period. Most accounts state that the book was found in an unlocked car parked in Jetty Road, Glenelg – either in the rear floor well, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
40|$|During October 1991, a {{combined}} survey was done into {{the presence and}} use of safety belts and child <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars. Contrary to previous years, it also looked at the belt use by both drivers and front seat passengers. The use of seat belts by car drivers in 1991 was practically {{the same as in}} 1990, and amounted to 77 %. The belt use by drivers on roads within built-up areas increased to 62 %. In view of this, the strong decrease of belt use started in 1990 was stopped in 1991. On roads outside built-up areas, the belt use by front seat passengers decreased to 78 %. An increase of the belt use by front seat passengers to 68 % was found on locations within built-up areas. Differences in seat belt use by car drivers appeared to correlate significantly with the type of the road. Per province, great differences were found in belt use on roads within and outside built-up areas, both for drivers and front seat passengers. In this context, the northern provinces showed the highest percentages of wearing rates. Contrary to locations outside built-up areas, the presence of an occupant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front seat of the car appeared to influence belt use by the driver. Sex still appeared to influence belt use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front seats of cars: seat belts were more often worn by women than by men. These percentages were respectively 83 % and 75 % on roads outside built-up areas, and 69 % and 59 % respectively on locations within built-up areas. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> survey locations, it was found that in about 47 % of the cars a safety system was present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> and in <b>the</b> middle of the seat the presence was 34 %. Compared with 1990, this means an increase of <b>the</b> belt use <b>on</b> side <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of 8 % for locations outside built-up areas, and for inside built-up areas an increase of approximately 12 %. These percentages were for the middle of the seat 6 % and 14 % respectively. In comparison with 1990, the use of <b>seat</b> belts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars in 1991 decreased strongly. This use appeared to relate strongly with the age of the car occupants. Compared with 1990, a substantial increase of the use of a safety system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear seats of cars in 1991 was found among the children in the age groups up to 5 years old and 5 - 12 years old. The belt use by the driver appeared to have an influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of a safety system by occupants <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars. If a safety system is present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear seats, the difference in wearing rates between roads outside and within built-up areas amounted to 5 %: 24 % versus 29 %. It is shown that <b>the</b> belts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> were not often used by adults. In view of the wearing rates among adults, additional policy to be directed at publicity is needed to enhance the use of belts on rear seats...|$|R

40|$|On 1 January 1990, the {{presence}} of <b>seat</b> belts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of new (imported) passenger cars was stipulated by law and on 1 April 1992 the use of rear seat belts when present was made compulsory. This report contains: a) the annual survey conducted since 1989 into {{the presence}} and use of both seat belts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> and of child restraint systems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear seats of cars; and b) an evaluation study into {{the effect of the}} introduction of <b>the</b> law <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>seat</b> belts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars. <b>The</b> most important results are as follows: (1) From the year 1991 to 1992, a large increase in the percentage of seat belt use on <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> when a seat belt was present; on city roads from 15 % to 31 %, on rural roads from 12 to 37 %. The percentage is still low; (2) As regards the front seat in the given period, the percentage increased from 62 % to 66 % in built-up areas and on rural roads no significant change was found, around 80 %; (3) More than 90 % of the drivers and back-seat passengers knew about <b>the</b> law <b>on</b> rear-seat belt use; (4) About 80 % of the persons interviewed have seen publicity regarding seat belts on television; (5) Around 50 % of drivers and back-seat passengers said they 'forgot' to use their seat belts; and (6) around 70 % of the persons interviewed would like an automatic signal to tell them when the seat belt was not used. It was concluded that the possibilities for increasing the use of seat belts in front and <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars are great. Recommendations were given regarding information campaigns, police enforcement, social coercion and technical provisions...|$|R
2500|$|This {{would not}} be the last time that the band {{attracted}} controversy with its album covers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the exploration of seat belt use in Greece and particularly the identification of the parameters affecting seat belt use in Greece. A national field survey was conducted for the analytical recording of seat belt use. A binary logistic regression model was developed, and the impact of each parameter on seat belt use in Greece was quantified. Parameters included in the model concern characteristics of car occupants (gender, age and position in the car), the type of the car and the type of the road network. The data collection revealed that in Greece, the non-use of seat belt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> urban road network was higher than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> national and rural road network and young and older men use seat belts the least. The developed model showed that travelling on a national road is negative for not wearing the seat belt. Finally, the variable with <b>the</b> highest impact <b>on</b> not wearing a seat belt is being a passenger <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats.</b> © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
