5|$|The {{building}} was rebuilt in 1953 {{after having been}} destroyed during the war. The pavilion measures three bays by two, but is nearly a perfect square. It is built on a short stone platform called a yuetai (月台) which is accessed by a short set of stairs. While from the outside, the pavilion appears to only have two stories, there are actually three, with the second floor being hidden from <b>outside</b> <b>view.</b> Each of the exterior levels {{is surrounded by a}} perimeter of columns.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E

2500|$|The modern Zócalo in Mexico City is 57,600 m2 (240 m × 240 m), {{making it}} one of the largest city squares in the world. It is bordered by the Cathedral to the north, the National Palace to the east, the Federal District {{buildings}} to the south and the Old Portal de Mercaderes to the west, the Nacional Monte de Piedad building at the north-west corner, with the Templo Mayor site to the northeast, just <b>outside</b> <b>view.</b> In the centre is a flagpole with an enormous Mexican flag ceremoniously raised and lowered each day [...] and carried into the National Palace. There is an entrance to the Metro station [...] "Zócalo" [...] located at the northeast corner of the square but no sign above ground indicates its presence.|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{her last}} film roles, The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969), she co-starred with Anthony Quinn, and they played husband and wife in what Life {{magazine}} called [...] "perhaps the most memorable fight since Jimmy Cagney smashed Mae Clarke {{in the face with}} a half a grapefruit." [...] Magnani and Quinn did feud in private <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> of the cameras, however, and their animosity spilled over into their scenes:"By the time the movie makers were ready to shoot the fight scene, the stars were ready too. Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with a rolling pin, but with her foot; she kicked so hard she broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. 'That's not in the script', Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, 'I'm supposed to win this fight, remember?" ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the captain}} of Dreadnaught, the player could assume the command {{of any of the}} four {{workstations}} on the command bridge. From the command station (CMD), the player received his/her mission briefings and could sometimes control other ships through a remote link. The station also had access to an accurate star map. The ship was normally flown from the navigation station (NAV). From the weapons station (WEP), the player had an <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> of Dreadnaught's wire frame model. Following a locked target, the angle of view could rotate 360 degrees on all [...] This workstation also had a ripple fire mode which allowed attacking quickly a large group of enemies. The fourth station engineering (ENG) was for controlling the repairs when the ship was damaged by weapons or a collision with another object. However, the automated repair functioned well and player supervision was rarely needed. The station also had a fuel gauge, which was nonfunctional because the game design was changed to give Dreadnaught limitless fuel.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the subway}} scene, the set was first {{planned to be}} shot in a real subway station, but due {{to the amount of}} the actions and the wire works, the {{decision}} was made to shoot on set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves' stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot where Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had side mounted to it a real minigun, which was set to cycle at half normal full (3000 rounds per min) firing rate. The visual effect of the helicopters rotating blades was effected by using strobe lighting.|$|E

60|$|Well, why shouldn't I talk {{my mind to}} him? He'd {{never had}} an <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> of himself for years, and I {{resolved}} {{to stand up to}} him. We went at it hammer and tongs! It became clear that he supposed me to be a Socialist, a zealous, embittered hater of all ownership--and also an educated man of the vilest, most pretentiously superior description. His principal grievance was that I thought I knew everything; to that he recurred again and again....|$|E
6000|$|Not {{only the}} eyes but the heads and {{shoulders}} of the moving public now became visible to those inside, while the intermittent spurts became gradually a continuous shower of letters. The full significance of the old superscription, [...] "Haste, post haste, for thy life," [...] now began to dawn on Miss Lillycrop. The hurry, mentioned elsewhere in our description of the <b>outside</b> <b>view,</b> increased as the minutes of grace flew by, and the visitors fairly laughed aloud {{when they saw the}} cataract of correspondence--the absolute waterfall, with, now and then, a bag or an entire bandboxful of letters, like a loosened boulder--that tumbled into the baskets below.|$|E
60|$|After Madame M. and I had {{finished}} the Pantheon we drove to the Conciergerie; for I {{wanted to see the}} prison of the hapless Marie Antoinette. That restless architectural mania, which never lets any thing alone here, is rapidly modernizing it; the scaffoldings are up, and workmen busy in making it as little historical as possible. Nevertheless, the old, gloomy arched gateway, and the characteristic peaked Norman towers, still remain; and we stopped our carriage {{the other side of the}} Seine, to get a good look at it. We drove to the door, and tried to go in, but were told that we could not without an order from somebody or other. (I forget who;) so we were obliged to content ourselves with an <b>outside</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Peck's {{book was}} {{furnished}} with multiple illustrations by Harry C. Wilkinson. This sets it apart from most Utopian {{works of the}} era, though King Gillette's The Human Drift (1894) was similarly well-illustrated. Wilkinson's pictures show <b>outside</b> <b>views</b> and floor plans of the buildings lavishly described by Peck, as well as street plans of the city's neighborhoods, and a [...] "coupon check" [...] book.|$|R
5000|$|At Monticello, Jefferson asked Hemings and Dinsmore {{to build}} 'porticles,' or small enclosures, {{at the south}} side of the {{building}} with louvered blinds that enclosed his living quarters and blocked <b>outside</b> <b>views</b> into his bedroom and study. [...] Hemmings fashioned one of the porticles into an aviary, likely for Jefferson's mockingbirds. Hemmings independently completed the Chinese railing, Venetian blinds, cellar sashes, bedchamber closet, and window shutters at Monticello.|$|R

Once the primitives that are <b>outside</b> of the <b>view</b> box are removed, the primitives that are still inside of the view box will be drawn into new triangles to be proceeded to the next stage.|$|R
60|$|The men had stamped {{down the}} nests and driven the birds from the galley, so that I could now enter without contest. One door had been already blocked with rice; {{the place was}} in part darkness, full of a foul stale smell, and a cloud of nasty flies; it had been left, besides, in some disorder, or else the birds, during their time of tenancy, had knocked the things about; and the floor, like the deck before we washed it, was spread with pasty filth. Against the wall, in the far corner, I found a {{handsome}} chest of camphor-wood bound with brass, such as Chinamen and sailors love, and indeed all of mankind that plies in the Pacific. From its <b>outside</b> <b>view</b> I could thus make no deduction; and, strange to say, the interior was concealed. All the other chests, as I have said already, we had found gaping open, and their contents scattered abroad; the same remark we found to apply afterwards in the quarters of the seamen; only this camphor-wood chest, a singular exception, was both closed and locked.|$|E
60|$|The class-war, like wars between nations, {{produces}} {{two opposing}} views, each equally true and equally untrue. The citizen {{of a nation}} at war, when he thinks of his own countrymen, thinks of them primarily as he has experienced them, in dealings with their friends, in their family relations, and so on. They seem {{to him on the}} whole kindly, decent folk. But a nation with which his country is at war views his compatriots through the medium of a quite different set of experiences: as they appear in the ferocity of battle, in the invasion and subjugation of a hostile territory, or in the chicanery of a juggling diplomacy. The men of whom these facts are true are the very same as the men whom their compatriots know as husbands or fathers or friends, but they are judged differently because they are judged on different data. And so it is with those who view the capitalist {{from the standpoint of the}} revolutionary wage-earner: they appear inconceivably cynical and misjudging to the capitalist, because the facts upon which their view is based are facts which he either does not know or habitually ignores. Yet the view from the outside is just as true as the view from the inside. Both are necessary to the complete truth; and the Socialist, who emphasizes the <b>outside</b> <b>view,</b> is not a cynic, but merely the friend of the wage-earners, maddened by the spectacle of the needless misery which capitalism inflicts upon them.|$|E

5000|$|Frank William Micklethwaite (1849-1925) was a {{prominent}} Canadian photographer, professionally known as F.W. Micklethwaite, whose photographs of Toronto and the Muskoka area form an important and unique photographic record of the province of Ontario's history in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Micklethwaite specialized in <b>outside</b> <b>views</b> and landscapes, as well as architectural and commercial photography, {{and he was one}} of Toronto's best known photographers. [...] His images of Toronto have been credited for making the 19th century streetscapes come alive.|$|R
