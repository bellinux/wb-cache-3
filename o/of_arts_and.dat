5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, the University {{underwent}} significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it {{developed into a}} major research university. For much of the 19th century, the University consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Sciences. In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously {{a part of the}} Faculty <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Sciences, became an independent faculty.|$|E

5|$|As a Northern Igbo city, Enugu shares {{cultural}} traits {{with its}} neighbouring towns. Two important Igbo traditional festivals {{take place in}} Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each have a name. This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it {{is supported by the}} Enugu Council <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Culture. The second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as 'iwa ji', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a root vegetable that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people. Recently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Culture. The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Culture included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events. The Enugu Festival of Arts was started in 1986; it has modernised the Mmanwu festival by transferring it from its traditional village surroundings to the urban setting of Enugu. Diana, Princess of Wales was a notable spectator of Enugu's cultural shows when she visited the city in 1990.|$|E
