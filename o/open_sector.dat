It {{is based on}} the Latvia’s {{quarterly}} data for the time period from 1995 to 2002 since we eliminate the early years of transition. Using conventional time series econometric technique we find strong empirical evidence in favor of internal transmission mechanism, i. e. productivity growth in the <b>open</b> <b>sector</b> leads to an increase in the relative price of non-tradable goods. The existence of external transmission mechanism is also accepted, since higher than in Germany productivity growth in the Latvia’s <b>open</b> <b>sector</b> brings about higher non-tradables inflation and thus overall inflation reflecting also the appreciation of the CPI-based real exchange rate. The paper also calculates inflation, inflation differential vis-à-vis Germany and real appreciation justified by the Balassa-Samuelson effect. We find that inflation rate in Latvia attributable to the Balassa-Samuelson effect amounts to 0, 5 - 1 %, but long term value for inflation in Latvia resulting from productivity gains in the <b>open</b> <b>sector</b> is found to be 1 - 2 %. Accordingly to our estimates the impact of the Balassa-Samuelson effect on inflation differential with respect to Germany is not expected to exceed 1, 5 % in the following years. Thus an increase in productivity in the <b>open</b> <b>sector</b> is not assumed to hinder Latvia’s ability to fulfill the Maastricht criteria...|$|E

40|$|Body size {{of large}} herbivores {{is a crucial}} life history {{variable}} influencing individual fitness-related traits. While {{the importance of this}} parameter in determining temporal trends in population dynamics is well established, much less information is available on spatial variation in body size at a local infra-population scale. The relatively recent increase in landscape fragmentation over the last century has lead to substantial spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality across much of the modern agricultural landscape. In this paper, we analyse variation in body mass and size of roe deer inhabiting a heterogeneous agricultural landscape characterised by a variable degree of woodland fragmentation. We predicted that body mass should vary in relation to the degree of access to cultivated meadows and crops providing high quality diet supplements. In support of our prediction, roe deer body mass increased along a gradient of habitat fragmentation, with the heaviest deer occurring in the most <b>open</b> <b>sectors</b> and the lightest in the strict forest environment. These spatial differences were particularly pronounced for juveniles, reaching _ 3 kg (ca 20 % of total body mass) between the two extremes of this gradient, and likely have a marked impact on individual fates. We also found that levels of both nitrogen and phosphorous were higher in deer faecal samples in the more <b>open</b> <b>sectors</b> compared to the forest environment, suggesting that the spatial patterns in body mass could be linked to the availability of high quality feeding habitat provided by the cultivated agricultural plain. Finally, we found that adults in the forest sector were ca 1 kg lighter for a given body size than their counterparts in the more <b>open</b> <b>sectors,</b> suggesting that access to nutrient rich foods allowed deer to accumulate substantial fat reserves, which is unusual for roe deer, with likely knock-on effects for demographic traits and, hence, population dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Most recent draft here. This study uses new {{measures}} of real exchange rates {{to investigate the}} decline of Amer-ican manufacturing employment in the early 2000 s, comparing it to the smaller decline in the 1980 s. I find that US manufacturing sectors with greater initial exposure to trade in the 1970 s were disproportionately affected by the ensuing dollar appreciation in the 1980 s, and that more <b>open</b> <b>sectors</b> in the 1990 s also suffered comparative declines in output and employment when US unit labor costs appreciated relative to US trading partners. Employment losses in both the 1980 s {{and in the early}} 2000 s were due to in-creased job destruction and suppressed job creation, and appear to exhibit hysteresis. Additionally, more <b>open</b> <b>sectors</b> experienced relative declines in shipments, value-added, investment, production worker wages, and total factor productivity as US relative unit labor costs in manufacturing rose. I explain the persistent effects of exchange rate move-ments on manufacturing using a Melitz model extension with sunk fixed costs, which leads to a dynamic gravity equation whereby shocks to trade have persistent effects that decay over time. The appreciation of US relative unit labor costs can plausibly explain {{more than two-thirds of the}} decline in manufacturing employment in the early 2000 s...|$|R

A new phenomenon emerges, the appearance of multiplicities and fixed-point ambiguities in the boundary algebra not inherited from the closed sector.

40|$|The NAHE–set, that {{underlies}} the realistic free fermionic models, corresponds to Z 2 × Z 2 orbifold at an enhanced symmetry point, with (h 11,h 21) = (27, 3). Alternatively, a manifold {{with the same}} data is obtained by starting with a Z 2 × Z 2 orbifold at a generic point on the lattice and adding a freely acting Z 2 involution. In this paper we study type I orientifolds on the manifolds that underly the NAHE–based models by incorporating such freely acting shifts. We present new models in the Type I vacuum which are modulated by Z n 2 for n = 2, 3. In the case of n = 2, the Z 2 × Z 2 structure is a composite orbifold Kaluza Klein shift arrangement. The partition function provides a simpler spectrum with chiral matter. For n = 3, the case discussed is a Z 2 modulation of the T 6 /Z 2 × Z 2 spectrum.
