5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} {{to the standards of}} ethical drugs, as opposed to patent medicines. Ethical drugs were drugs that could be obtained <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> new approach to the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always {{responsible for their own}} illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E

25|$|After the Communist takeover, {{the state}} instituted strict control over social life, {{including}} {{a ban on}} religion and a law that limited families to one child, seizing control over the most personal aspects of day-to-day life.

25|$|The other road {{should be}} opened: {{it is not}} at all laid out. It can be opened <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> social and {{political}} awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.|$|E

25|$|While some of Moby's {{earlier work}} {{garnered}} critical and commercial success within the electronic dance music scene, Play {{was both a}} critical success and a commercial phenomenon. The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. It eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all-time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.|$|E
25|$|As {{a border}} town {{situated}} at the Bosnian-Serb Drina river, Zvornik was of great strategic importance. It is significant because Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are linked at that point not <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> road bridge between the Zvornik urban area and the Karakaj industrial zone, and another one in Zvornik itself, but also via a railroad bridge between Karakaj {{and the town of}} Čelopek.

25|$|Taking low-key {{photographs}} {{is possible}} in dark rooms where light penetrates <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> small window, but the best results are achieved by using artificial studio lights. Sometimes, a single directed light source is sufficient. Usually, well-targeted sources are used to get the desired effect, since a large light source could considerably reduce the desired result. Special {{attention is paid to}} having sufficient details that will, invariably, be left in the shade. This type of lighting it's also known as Rembrandtian light.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to escape predation include burrowing into substrate and being active <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> restricted {{period of the}} day. Furthermore, insects may feign death, a response termed thanatosis. Beetles, particularly weevils, are especially fond {{of this sort of}} acting. Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes advantage of these markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger’s {{critique}} of technology has certainly inspired environmentalist and postmodernist of our time. Deep ecologists, like Heidegger, allege that certain metaphysical presuppositions {{are responsible for}} ecological destruction, and also contend that any transformation can be brought about <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> renewed awareness about the world. Then the key to environmental crisis, require an ontological shift: from an anthropocentric and utilitarian understanding of world to an understanding which lets things be. A non-anthropocentric humanity would probably initiate attitudes, practices, and institutions that would exhibit respect and care for all beings.|$|E

25|$|Justice White's dissent {{argued that}} the act should have been upheld. Determining the level of {{spending}} {{by the federal government}} is a legislative function, not an executive one, he argued. Even if the power were executive, White did not see anything wrong with delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and Bicameralism Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> joint resolution.|$|E
25|$|The Educational Freedom Law, {{signed in}} early 1959, also freed private {{universities}} from limits {{imposed by the}} 1885 Avellaneda Law, which forbad them from issuing official degrees directly, but <b>only</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> public university. The law led to controversy {{because most of the}} new universities and private schools, which would become eligible for state subsidies, were religious. Supporters applauded Frondizi’s vision of private universities that could co-exist with public ones, and it was seen as a progressive measure. Those in favour of a strictly secular educational system believed the law to be a concession given to the church in exchange for support, however, and became disillusioned with the pragmatic Frondizi.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of {{strained}} coexistence, Chief Opchanacanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all.

More than 300 settlers were killed in the attack, about a third of the colony's English-speaking population. Sir Thomas Dale's development at Henricus, which was to feature a college to educate the natives, and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred, were both essentially wiped out.
