5|$|In 1901 Newman {{became the}} lessee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{as well as}} its manager, but the {{following}} year, after unwise investment in theatrical presentations, he was declared bankrupt. The music publisher Chappell and Co took over the lease of the building, retaining Newman as manager. The Queen's Hall orchestra and concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, encouraged Newman and Wood to continue with their project of musical education, and underwrote the Proms and the main Symphony Concert seasons. Newman remained manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> until 1906 and manager of the concerts until he died in 1926.|$|E

5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> while in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it {{into the trunk of}} the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} opening, Ravenscroft {{appointed}} Robert Newman as manager. Newman {{had already had}} three different careers, as a stockjobber, a bass soloist, and a concert agent.

5|$|The Great Hall {{was built}} in the mid-15th century, and in the early 16th century the {{entrance}} porch and oriel room was added to the eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and the great parlour and little parlour to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> with bedrooms above. Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755, tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair. In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range 'had lately been destroyed and a farm house built on the site', (this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared.|$|E

5|$|The only {{surviving}} part of Clifton Hall is {{the early}} 16th-century tower wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{often referred to as}} a pele tower.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of listed {{structures}} in the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, including the 1720 wellhouse that supplied water to the hall until the 1860s, and the early-18th-century ornamental sundial in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> depicting a black slave clad in leaves, carrying the sundial above his head. The stable buildings, the slaughterhouse, the deer house, the orangery, and an ashlar shelter to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> all date from the 17th or 18th century. Barn Cottages date from at least 1751. The cottages were originally a single barn, which was converted in the 19th century. Other grade II listed structures in the grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> include: the lakeside wall (18th century); two small piers south of the garden forecourt (18th century); a pier north west of the garden forecourt (18th century); the gateway opposite the kitchen (1750); the piers at the south of forecourt garden topped with lions (18th century); and an obelisk erected by George, 2nd Earl of Warrington, in 1714 in memory of his mother. Near the hall there is a Grade II* listed sawmill, probably built in 1616.|$|E
