500|$|Young {{specimens}} of A.hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially {{embedded in the}} substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star-shaped (...) pattern to form 4–20 irregular [...] "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture,</b> and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.|$|E

50|$|A pugmill or {{pug mill}} is a machine in which clay or other {{materials}} are mixed {{into a plastic}} state or a similar machine for the trituration of ore. Industrial applications are found in pottery, bricks, cement and {{some parts of the}} concrete and asphalt mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance. Mixing materials at <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture</b> content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number {{and the size of the}} paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soil type}} - that is, grain-size distributions, {{shape of the}} soil grains, {{specific}} gravity of soil solids, and amount and type of clay minerals, present - has a great influence on the maximum dry unit weight and <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture</b> content. [...] It also has a great influence on how the materials should be compacted in given situations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re-orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives {{air out of the}} soil. Determination of adequate compaction is done by determining the in-situ density of the soil and comparing it to the maximum density determined by a laboratory test. The most commonly used laboratory test is called the Proctor compaction test and there are two different methods in obtaining the maximum density. They are the standard Proctor and modified Proctor tests; the modified Proctor is more commonly used. For small dams, the standard Proctor may still be the reference.|$|E

[...] David Arora in Mushrooms Demystified The fruit body is 1 - 8 cm in diameter from tip to tip when expanded. The exoperidium is thick, and the rays are typically [...] (divided into small areas by cracks and crevices) on the upper surface, and are dark grey to black. The spore case is sessile (lacking a stalk), light gray to tan color and 1 to 3 cm broad with a felt-like or scurfy (coated with loose scaly crust) surface; {{the top of the}} spore case is opened by an irregular slit, tear or pore. The interior of the spore case, the gleba, is white and solid when young, and divided into oval locules—a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from Geastrum. The gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures. Small dark hairlike threads (rhizomorphs) extend {{from the base of the}} fruit body into the substrate. The rhizomorphs are fragile, and often break off after maturity.The spores are spherical or nearly so, reddish-brown, thick-walled and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7-11 µm; the warts are about 1 µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, and will not stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0.90-1.45 µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5-6.5 µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11-15 by 18-24 µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3-5.5 µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4-6 μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6-8 μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3-4 μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3-6 μm in diameter.|$|E

The degradation rate was estimated precisely from weight loss and the CO 2 evolution rate. The degradation rate were nearly constant at a moisture content of 30 %– 80 % on a-wet-weight basis. Microorganisms from the environment propagated in the reactor with no inoculums added. The number of microorganisms showed a trend {{similar to that of the}} degradation rate. The microorganism community changed according to the moisture content of the matrix and were considered to attain a constant degradation rate at a wide range of moisture {{content of a}} matrix.|$|R

Interface shear strength parameters for various combinations of 12 different lining materials were studied and presented in this paper. This comprehensive testing program covers the interfaces between: 1) soil and compacted clay liner (CCL), 2) geomembrane (HDPEs or PVC) and soil, 3) geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) / CCL and soil, 4) geomembrane and geotextile, 5) geotextile and soil, 6) geotextile and GCL / CCL, and 7) geomembrane and GCL / CCL. The experiments were conducted under <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture</b> condition.

40|$|In most {{compaction}} test procedures, {{depending on the}} size of the compaction mould, a fraction of the soil sample with particle sizes larger than a specific value is discarded. This fact limits the use of laboratory values of {{compaction test}} parameters, namely the <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture</b> content and the maximum dry unit weight, for field compaction of soils. This technical note provides improved expressions for determining the <b>optimum</b> <b>moisture</b> content and the maximum dry unit weight of field soil samples on the basis of laboratory compaction test results, which do not consider the larger particles of the field soil samples. The improved expressions would be useful for earthworks, and for developing standards for compaction tests for field applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} {{describes}} the biosynthesis of a milkclotting protease by solid state fermentation (SSF) of a locally isolated mould, Rhizopus stolonifer. The production medium was prepared using wheat bran at 50 % (w/v). The production conditions are optimized by varying 7 parameters: carbon and nitrogen sources, medium moisture, temperature, pH, fermentation time and inoculum’s size. The maximum enzyme synthesis was measured after 96 h of incubation time at temperature of 28 °C. The optimum pH determined was 6 and the inoculum size was 3. 10 6 spores/ml. The <b>optimum</b> initial <b>moisture</b> content is comprised between 50 to 70 %. The formation of milk clotting protease is enhanced when galactose and peptone are used at 10 % (w/v) and 1 % (w/v) concentrations respectively. The maximum production of milk clotting protease is 120 US/ml. Keywords—Milk clotting activity, protease production...|$|R

Wilczek) plants {{were compared with}} those of non-stressed or well watered plants grown in a semi-controlled environment. Mungbean plants were subjected to variable water stress at three growth stages viz. from pre-flowering, flowering and pod development to harvest, The effect of soil moisture on the grain yield varied with the severity of stress and stage of crop growth. Water deficits during pre-flowering to harvest affected most the crop production, photosynthetic rate and the factors related. Soil moisture saturation reduced the yield to about 6 % of that of well watered plants. The yield loss was primarily caused by the reduction of canopy development, inhibition of photosynthetic rate and lower dry matter production. <b>Optimum</b> soil <b>moisture</b> for the growth and photosynthetic rate in mungbean plant was found around 0. 15 cm^ 3 /cm^ 3...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge {{treatment}} and utilization {{is an important}} issue for a biodegradable waste management strategy. Heavy metals in sewage sludge complicate its use. Vermicomposting is one of the ways to improve the characteristics of sewage sludge and to reduce the residual concentrations of heavy metals. Study on changes in the concentration of heavy metals (Chromium, Nickel and Cadmium), when vermicomposting sewage sludge, was performed using Californian earthworms (Eisenia fetida). For that purpose, 60 kg of sewage sludge from Vilnius Waste Water Treatment Plant were taken thus inserting 1. 5 kg of Californian earthworms into it. Optimal conditions for work (<b>optimum</b> temperature, <b>moisture,</b> pH) for earthworms to survive were maintained {{in the course of the}} study that lasted 120 days and was conducted in June – August. The samples of sewage sludge and earthworms were taken every 10 days. The concentrations of heavy metals in sewage sludge were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy...|$|R
