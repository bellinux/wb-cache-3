5|$|Link {{light rail}} service from Downtown Seattle to Tukwila International Boulevard station began on July 18, 2009, {{accompanied}} by a temporary shuttle bus to bring passengers to the airport from Tukwila. SeaTac/Airport station opened to regular service on December 19, 2009, during a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by 500 people, including U.S. Representative Jim McDermott of Seattle, Sound Transit Board Chair Greg Nickels and Port of Seattle Commissioner John Creighton. Initial ridership counts in January 2010 showed that the station increased light rail ridership by 2,000 passengers during its first month of service, coinciding with the holiday travel system.

For such singularities, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>linking</b> form is <b>the</b> Thurston-Bennequin number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>link</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singularity.
