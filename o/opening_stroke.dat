2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt.

5000|$|Another {{difference}} between the Lee and the Mauser designs {{was the use of}} [...] "cock-on-closing", which also helped to speed cycling by making the initial opening of the breech very easy. The closing stroke, which is generally more forceful than the <b>opening</b> <b>stroke,</b> cocks the rifle, adding to the ease of use. The Lee design also featured a shorter bolt travel and a 60-degree rotation of the bolt; these attributes also led to faster cycle times.|$|E

40|$|The HSE Annual Report 2011 {{confirms}} that the HSE substantially met its service plan commitments for 2011 in terms of services delivered, employment levels and funding. Demand for health services continues to grow {{as a result of}} population increases, economic changes and medical advancements. The HSE faced immense challenges in 2011 to operate within its funding and employment constraints in a way that minimised the impact on both the quality and range of services provided to patients and clients. In order to meet growing demand {{within the context of a}} reducing resource, services are being maximised through fast tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of doing business. Implementation of the National Clinical Programmes, being implemented by clinically led multidisciplinary teams across the country, is driving the re-engineering of traditional models of care. Progress during 2011 includes implementing the Acute Medicine Programme in twelve sites, <b>opening</b> seven <b>stroke</b> units and activating heart failure units in seven sites...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{a serious}} and current {{pathology}} responsible for disability and mortality in Martinique. Nowadays, modalities of treatment have evolved thanks to the <b>opening</b> of the <b>Strokes</b> Unit. Pulse pressure, pulsatic parameter of blood pressure has recently {{been identified as a}} risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. But, its impact on cerebrovascular pathology isn't clearly defined. Thanks to a multi-centric study about 452 people from ERMANCIA data, we were able to point out a biphasic relation between pulse pressure at day 7 th and mortality one year after stroke. Effectively, we found out mortality risk can be multiplied by 3, as far as low pulse pressures are concerned (70 mm Hg) are concerned comparing with medium pulse pressure. This risk is meaningful even after adjustments on age, sex, type of stroke, and medium blood pressure. Our research reveals a U curb between pulse pressure and mortality by stroke exits.

50|$|To make {{controllable}} {{automatic fire}} possible {{through such a}} system, designer Stechkin employs several mechanical solutions. Firstly, the slide has a very long stroke (three times {{the length of the}} cartridge). This allows time to slow the slide down and reduce felt recoil by minimising the jolt produced through the collision of the slide with the frame. Secondly, the rate-reducer lever offers extra resistance to the <b>opening</b> <b>stroke</b> of the slide, further slowing down the cycling process. Finally, the primary inertial rate reducing plunger delays the dropping of the hammer after the slide closes. The slide has a large cam that strikes a lever downwards. This lever transfers that energy to a spring-loaded weight located in the grip. The weight travels down, compressing its spring, then slams back up into the trigger bar, tripping the sear and firing the gun. Effectively, the rate reducer, which reduced the automatic rate of fire from 1000 RPM to 750RPM, also acts as the auto-sear.|$|E

5000|$|The rifle {{maintains}} the British cock-on-closing feature, {{in which the}} bolt's mainspring is loaded and the rifle cocked {{as part of the}} return stroke of the bolt, which aided rapid fire, especially as the action heated up. Most bolt action designs after the Mauser 98 cocked as part of the <b>opening</b> <b>stroke.</b> The rifle has a characteristic [...] "belly" [...] due to a deeper magazine, allowing the rifle to hold six rounds of the US [...]30-06 cartridge in the magazine, and one in the chamber. The M1917 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. In a manufacturing change from the Mauser 98 and the derivative Springfield, the bolt is not equipped with a third 'safety' lug. Instead, as on the earlier Model 1895 (Chilean) Mauser, the bolt handle recesses into a notch in the receiver, which serves as an emergency locking lug in the event of failure of the frontal locking lugs. This change saved machine time needed on the rifle bolt, cutting costs and improving production rates, and this alteration has since been adopted by many commercial bolt-action rifle designs for the same reasons.The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, P13 and P14, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently.The M1917 Enfield bolt locking lugs had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The design probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort was applied to the extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the bolt was fully locked. The location of the safety on the right rear of the receiver has also been copied by most sporting bolt-action rifles since, as it falls easily under the firer's thumb. The trigger pull is ≥ 3 lb-f N. One notable design flaw was the leaf spring that powered the ejector, which could break off and render the ejector inoperable. A combat-expedient repair method was to slip a bit of rubber under the bolt stop spring. A redesigned ejector, incorporating a small coil spring in place of the fragile leaf spring, was developed and can be fitted to the M1917 to remedy this issue.|$|E
40|$|Micro Combined Heat and Power {{systems or}} microCHP systems {{generate}} heat and electricity for a home. Stirling engines {{are widely used}} as prime movers in microCHP applications. Stirling engine is an external combustion engine having an enclosed working fluid (as helium) that is alternately compressed and expanded to operate a piston. The displacer shuttles the working fluid between the hot and cold ends. The piston is coupled to a transmission and to an electrical machine to generate power. Conventional Stirling engines are not controllable to a great degree. The piston and displacer {{are connected to the}} same crank and they maintain the same phase difference throughout the cycle. Also the piston and displacer are normally constructed to move in a sinusoidal fashion. The Active Stirling Engine is a new concept introduced in this thesis which has a free displacer. The displacer is driven separately compared to a coupled drive in conventional Stirling engines. The displacer motion can be non-linear with dwell at each ends of the <b>stroke,</b> <b>opening</b> up the possibilities to increase the pressure volume diagram which indicates the work done by the engine. A separately driven displacer also allows introducing phase control and stroke control to improve the controllability of a Stirling engine. This thesis examines the effect of non-linear displacer motion and phase control of the displacer on Stirling engine performance. Simulations are performed in Sage, the leading Stirling engine simulation software, to understand the effect of displacer phase control. A test rig is constructed with the actively controlled displacer connected to a linear machine controlled by a programmable servo. Heat is applied to the test rig though an electric heating coil. The test rig is charged with nitrogen at 20 Bar pressure. The power piston is connected to a rotating electrical machine via the transmission. The rotating electrical machine is used to start the engine and to act as the generator. The test rig is instrumented to determine the linear position of the displacer and piston, angular position of the rotating electrical machine shaft, temperatures, pressures and flow. A LabVIEW™ based data acquisition system is set up to capture data from the test rig. Data is collected at various test cases. The simulation result is compared against post processed data. An efficiency improvement of 15 % is achieved using this method and is demonstrated experimentally. Applications in micro combined heat and power systems utilising the improved efficiency due to non linear motion and controllability due to phase control are explored in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on PA 6 -GF 50 {{integral}} foams {{have been}} carried out using different material systems: longfiber- and shortfiber-reinforced PA 6 as well as unreinforced PA 6 as a reference material. Both chemical and physical blowing agents were applied. Breathing mold technology (decompression of the mold) was selected for the foaming process. The integral foam design, which can be conceived as a sandwich structure, helps to save material in the neutral axis area and maintains a distance between load-bearing, unfoamed skin layers. For all test series an initial mold gap of 2. 5 mm was chosen and the same amount of material was injected. In order to realize different density reductions, the mold <b>opening</b> <b>stroke</b> was varied. The experiments showed that, at a constant mass per unit area, integral polyamide 6 foams have a significantly higher bending stiffness than compact components, due to their higher area moment of inertia after foaming. At a constant surface weight the bending stiffness in these experiments could be increased by up to 600 %. Both shortfiber- and longfiber-reinforced polyamide 6 showed an increase in energy absorption during foaming...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic foam {{injection}} molding (FIM) {{in combination with}} insert molding (IM) offers a possibility to generate sandwich panels in a one-step process. The prepared face sheets are first positioned inside the mold. A preheating process is carried out using quartz infrared emitters, which are mounted on a linear robot, before the mold is closed. The injection of the gas/melt mixture is combined with an embossing of the mold to further improve the face-core-adhesion. Finally, to initiate the foaming process, adjust the extent of foaming of the core and achieve the desired component dimensions, a mold <b>opening</b> <b>stroke</b> is carried out. The process described was performed with different facing materials, layer dimensions and overall wall thicknesses. Drawn PP fabrics (Curv®) as well as PP/GF 70 tapes and consolidated sheets (unidirectional) were used to generate sandwich panels {{in a range of}} 5 to 6. 4 mm thickness. PP was also chosen to form the foamed core which, in combination with the Curv® face sheets, produces a fully recyclable self-reinforced polymer (SRP) composite. Detailed process descriptions and the results of bending tests demonstrate the high potential. Other focuses are the preheating process and the foam structure...|$|E
