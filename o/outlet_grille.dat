40|$|Background: Awareness {{about health}} {{problems}} caused by air conditioner is very important. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} have knowledge about proper maintenance of air conditioner. At the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, air conditioners are used in every tutorial rooms. This study was performed to provide adequate information on the fungi, such as Aspergillus, Penicillium and Mucor, found in air conditioners. Methods: A descriptive laboratory study was used to identify the presence and the type of pathogenic fungi from air conditioners in tutorial rooms. Thirty-four samples were collected from the air <b>outlet</b> <b>grille</b> of the air conditioners and cultured on Sabouraud agar at 27 °C for 2 weeks. Fungi presence were then identified microscopically Results: The results showed that the majority of air conditioners in tutorial rooms of the Faculty of Medicine, University Padjadjaran contained many types of fungus that grew in Sabouraud agar. From 34 samples, thirty two samples were positive and 2 samples were negative. Various fungus have been identified, those were Penicillium (37. 5...|$|E

40|$|Philonthus {{and other}} genera of Philonthina possess {{a pair of}} prototergal glands located in the first {{abdominal}} tergum and hidden at rest by hind wings and elytra. In Philonthus varians they occupy the whole length of the tergum and form a pouch-like invaginated reservoir with a scaly glandular zone and a smooth <b>outlet.</b> A <b>grille</b> of long setae covers the opening of each gland. The fine structure of these glands is given for the first time. Three types of cells {{are found in the}} glandular epithelium. Epidermal cells underlie the cuticular scales, numerous class 1 secretory cells open in the centre of calyces made of finger-like processes of the cuticle, and class 3 cells are connected to pored tubercles. A cytological comparison is made with the diverse class 1 cells described to date in Coleoptera. In these cells different evolutionary trends are shown {{in the structure of the}} cuticular apparatus, particularly in the number, size and position of the cuticular apertures as well as in the length and abundance of epicuticular filaments. A possible defensive function of the prototergal glands against pathogens and their interest for the phylogenetic study of Staphylininae are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|The 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 is {{a version}} of the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray with a 6.2L {{supercharged}} and intercooled LT4 V8 engine with Rotocast A356T6 aluminum cylinder heads and a 1.7L Eaton R1740 TVS supercharger, which makes 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque. The Z06 is available with a Tremec seven-speed manual with rev-matching technology or a Hydra-Matic 8L90 eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. It also has a removable carbon fiber roof panel, uniquely calibrated SLA-type front and rear suspension design, standard Magnetic Selective Ride Control dampers, standard smart electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD) integrated with Electronic Stability Control and Performance Traction Management systems, 19x10-inch front and 20x12-inch rear spin-cast aluminum wheels on Michelin Pilot Sport P285/30ZR19 front and 335/25ZR20 rear tires, extended fenders by 56 mm at the front and 80 mm at the rear, Brembo brakes (371x33mm front and 365x25mm rear two-piece steel brake discs, aluminum six-piston front and four-piston rear fixed calipers), a front splitter, spats around the front wheel openings, a unique carbon-fiber hood with a larger vent, larger front fender vents and unique air blades over the inlets on the rear fenders, a larger unique rear spoiler, and rear-fascia openings that are larger than the Stingray. The redesigned mesh pattern on the front fascia allows for maximum airflow to the supercharger's intercooler heat exchanger, while dedicated brake-cooling intakes and wider <b>grille</b> <b>outlets</b> on the bottom serves as air diffusers. Inside the Z06, there are a choice of 2 magnesium frame seats (GT seat or a Competition Sport seat with more aggressive side bolstering), a steel-reinforced grab bar on the center console for the passenger, soft-touch materials {{on the edge of the}} console, and a fully wrapped interior with soft-touch materials (Napa leather, aluminum, carbon fiber and micro-suede depending on the trim level).|$|R
