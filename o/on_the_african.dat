5|$|According to the International Organization for Migration, Nigeria {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic increase}} in remittances sent home from overseas Nigerians, going from USD 2.3 billion in 2004 to 17.9 billion in 2007. The United States accounts for the largest portion of official remittances, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Spain and France. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> continent, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Libya and South Africa are important source countries of remittance flows to Nigeria, while China is the biggest remittance-sending country in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Following growing {{pressure}} from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is {{normally}} picked by a perched bird, {{although there is}} a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines.

US-based international aviation magazine Air Transport World named it the most profitable airline in Africa for the 2010 fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Kritschgau and Skinner put Mulder under {{additional}} tests to verify his abnormal brain activity. They again inject Mulder with phenytoin, {{but this time}} they are caught by Fowley and Mulder goes into a seizure. Meanwhile Dr. Barnes, in a bizarre type of experiment, kills his driver, but the driver soon reanimates and kills him instead. Scully flies back to the U.S. and visits Mulder at the hospital. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> coast, Ngebe arrives with the police, finding Dr. Barnes dead and the spaceship gone.|$|E
5|$|One Egyptian {{badminton}} player {{qualified for}} the Olympics, Hadia Hosny El Said.

5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Most cowpeas {{are grown}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} {{influence is}} also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one {{of a variety of}} flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E

5|$|The {{action was}} a rare victory for the French in the Mediterranean Sea, which had been largely under British control since the French Mediterranean Fleet had been {{destroyed}} in 1798 at the Battle of the Nile. This had trapped the French army in Egypt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> side of the Mediterranean, and all efforts to reinforce and resupply them had ended in failure, including three separate expeditions by Ganteaume's squadron. Swiftsure was later commissioned into the French Navy and fought at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the ship was recaptured by the British and rejoined the Royal Navy. Hallowell was subsequently court martialed {{for the loss of}} his ship, but was honourably acquitted and returned to naval service.|$|E
5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), the police were the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
5|$|The African art and Sackler {{buildings}} were built as twin pavilions, each one story above ground and with similar display space: five galleries each, {{and only one}} with natural light. They are differentiated by their roof adornments: domes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>African</b> art building and pyramids on the Sackler. The African art pavilion was built in red granite and uses the circle shape as its architectural theme, with round windows, rounded entrance staircase, and six, round domes on its roof. Inside, a limestone foyer overlooks the gardens and a curving stair hall leads visitors down curving stairs to the galleries. The galleries are large and customized by exhibition designers into smaller rooms to better suit small objects. The buildings are visible from Independence Avenue, and the new Enid A. Haupt Garden runs {{between them and the}} Smithsonian Institution Building. Underground, the museum and offices occupy the first two levels, and a third level hosts exhibition and educational rooms. Its levels are connected by a three-story enclosed arcade with large skylights set into the gardens above, through several feet of dirt. The pavilion was renovated in the early 2000s with a major donation from Eastman Kodak.|$|E
