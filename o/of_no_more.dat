5|$|As {{a result}} of poor {{attendance}} at Geelong Baseball Park, game one of the fifth-round series between New South Wales and the Victoria Aces was moved to La Trobe University, Melbourne. Although the Geelong games had attracted crowds <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 500, the moved game had an attendance of 2,200. Though no further regular season games were moved, the finals series hosted by the Aces was held at La Trobe University as well.|$|E
5|$|Bristol is {{also known}} for its {{research}} strength, having 15 departments gaining the top grade of 5* in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise. Overall, 36 out of 46 departments rated gained the top two ratings of 5 or 5*, and 76% of all the academic staff working in departments scored these top two levels. In terms of teaching strength, Bristol had an average Teaching Quality Assessment score of 22.05/24 before the TQA was abolished. Bristol's drop-out rate is also lower than the benchmark set by HEFCE <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 3.1%.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, {{in defiance of the}} earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{damage from}} the storm was limited; potent gusts uprooted {{numerous}} trees and blew debris onto streets throughout Basse-Terre. One road was blocked off to traffic during its passage as a precautionary measure, but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 1inch (25mm). Winds in the area were also limited; the highest gust was experienced on Buck Island, measuring 52mph (83km/h).|$|E
5|$|Killer7 was Suda51's {{first game}} {{released}} outside Japan. It received polarized reviews {{due to its}} unconventional control scheme and complex noir plot. The game's score, visual style and thought-provoking story received wide praise from most critics as the best aspects {{of the game and}} lead to several accolades and nominations. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. Despite these setbacks, Killer7s cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51's older works and the successful launch <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>More</b> Heroes.|$|E

Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than Mach0.95 {{at the time of}} the accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on roll. The school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E

These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more.</b> Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E

5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This {{was the beginning of the}} escalation of the conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.|$|E

5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 77°F (25°C), {{the organization of the}} system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed.
