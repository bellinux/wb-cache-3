5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the bus but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching madder red colour. They also changed {{the entrance to the}} bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then toughened {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E

During the match, Murdoch delivered a DDT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the ring. WWE Medical trainers came to ringside {{to check on}} Hurricane. The match concluded when Cade pinned the legitimately injured Hurricane, to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader {{in opposition to the}} dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, {{the exhausted}} Texians soon {{fell into the}} first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Buildings {{may have}} {{maintenance}} shafts for passage of pipes and ducts between floors. Climbing these shafts {{is known as}} shafting. The practice is similar to buildering, which is done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outsides</b> <b>of</b> buildings.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got away without {{incident}} and with no changes in position. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 bottom mines mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried {{in place of the}} AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|E
5|$|Norman stone keeps played both a {{military}} {{and a political}} role. Most of the keeps were physically extremely robust and, while they were not designed as an intended location for the final defence of a castle, they were often placed near weak points in the walls to provide supporting fire. Many keeps made compromises to purely military utility: Norwich Castle included elaborate blind arcading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the building, in a Roman style, and appears to had a ceremonial entrance route; The interior of the keep at Hedingham could have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from {{a military}} perspective. Similarly there has been extensive debate {{over the role of}} Orford Castle whose expensive, three-cornered design most closely echoes imperial Byzantine palaces and may have been intended by Henry II to be more symbolic than military in nature.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider {{than in any other}} known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are {{generally}} considered epizoic, or living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> other animals, mainly mammals. In the Arixeniina, family Arixeniidae, {{species of the}} genus Arixenia are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats (Cheiromeles torquatus), apparently feeding on bats' body or glandular secretions. On the other hand, species in the genus Xeniaria (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat's nest, {{where it has been}} found. Hemimerina includes Araeomerus found in the nest of Long-tailed pouch rats (Beamys), and Hemimerus which are found on Giant Cricetomys rats.|$|E

5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever Queen of the Cage {{match for}} number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship was next.

In this match, the participants fought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the ring to climb into the cage. The first two to do so had a standard wrestling match, with the winner determined by pinfall or submission. It lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the carriages were moved {{from the center of}} the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
