Goodwin has stated that circuit court judges will occasionally create circuit splits to [...] "hold the Supreme Court's toes to the fire" [...] and force the Supreme Court to overrule precedent in other circuits. Goodwin also wrote that [...] "some of <b>our</b> <b>number</b> actually found it intellectually stimulating to challenge the Supreme Court from time to time" [...] but that those judges were [...] "usually were rewarded by a Nine Zip reversal". Likewise, Judge Charles R. Wilson noted that when he drafted dissenting opinions, he would consider whether the parties planned to appeal {{the case to the}} Supreme Court of the United States, and [...] "f I believe that the parties will , I write the dissent with the Supreme Court in mind". C. Steven Bradford has also argued that circuit courts will [...] "disregard a Supreme Court precedent if convinced that the Supreme Court would not follow it".|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{construct}} new families of special numbers with their generating functions. These numbers are related to the many well-known numbers, which are the Bernoulli numbers, the Fibonacci numbers, the Lucas numbers, the Stirling numbers of the second kind and the central factorial <b>numbers.</b> <b>Our</b> other inspiration of this paper is related to the Golombek's problem golombek“ Aufgabe 1088, El. Math. 49 (1994) 126 - 127 ”. <b>Our</b> first <b>numbers</b> are not only related to the Golombek's problem, but also computation of the negative order Euler numbers. We compute a few values of the numbers which are given by some tables. We give some applications in Probability and Statistics. That is, special values of mathematical expectation in the binomial distribution and the Bernstein polynomials give us the value of <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> Taking derivative of our generating functions, we give partial differential equations and also functional equations. By using these equations, we derive recurrence relations and some formulas of <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> Moreover, we give two algorithms for computation <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> We also give some combinatorial applications, further remarks on <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> and their generating functions.

2500|$|The {{corpus of}} {{inscriptions}} {{is generally considered}} far too small to permit a systematic decipherment {{on the basis of}} an internal analysis of the texts. Yet already in 1946, one year after Dunand published the inscriptions, a claim for its decipherment was made, by Édouard Dhorme, a renowned Orientalist and former cryptanalyst from Paris. He noted that on the back of one of the inscribed bronze plates was a much shorter inscription ending in a row of seven nearly identical chevron-like marks, very much like <b>our</b> <b>number</b> [...] "1111111". He assumed this to be a number (probably [...] "seven", though Dhorme took it to be 4×10+3=43 because four marks were slightly larger than the other three), and guessed that the backside inscription as a whole contained a dating of the inscription.|$|E

The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from.

2500|$|Modern primality {{tests for}} general numbers n {{can be divided}} into two main classes, {{probabilistic}} (or [...] "Monte Carlo") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. [...] For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. [...] Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. [...] For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. [...] If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that <b>our</b> <b>number</b> is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. [...] On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.|$|E
2500|$|Fritz Sauckel, the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment, {{making him}} {{the man in charge}} of {{bringing}} slaves to the factories in Germany demanded the flight of young men to the countryside be stopped and called the maquis [...] "terrorists", [...] "bandits" [...] and [...] "criminals" [...] for their unwillingness to become slaves. The extent of popular resistance to the STO law can be seen in that one of every two French people who should have served in the STO failed to do so. Sauckel had been ordered by Hitler in February 1943 to produce half million workers from France for German industry no later than March 1943, and it was he who had pressured Laval to create the STO with the law of 16 February 1943. Sauckel had joined the NSDAP in 1923, making him an Alter Kämpfer (Old Fighter), and like many other Alte Kämpfer (who tended to the most extreme Nazis), Sauckel was a hard man. Despite warnings from Laval, Sauckel took the view that he was ordered by Albert Speer to produce a quota of slaves for German industry, that the men joining the maquis were sabotaging German industry by fleeing to the countryside rather than going to work as slaves in Germany and the solution was simply to kill them all, so he could meet his quota. Sauckel believed that once the maquis were wiped out, Frenchmen would obediently report to the STO and go to work in Germany. When Laval was presented with Sauckel's latest demand for French labor for German industry, he remarked: [...] "Have you been sent by de Gaulle?". Laval argued the réfractaries were not political opponents and should not be treated as such, arguing that an amnesty and a promise that the réfractaries would not be sent as slaves to Germany would nip the budding maquis movement. As Laval predicated, the hardline policies that Sauckel advocated turned the basically apolitical maquis political, driving them straight into the resistance as the maquisards turned to the established resistance groups to ask for arms and training. Sauckel decided that if Frenchmen would not report to the STO, he would have the Todt organisation use the shanghaillage (shanghaiing) the French by storming into cinemas to arrest the patrons or raiding villages in search of bodies to turn into slaves to meet the quotas imposed by Speer. Otto Abetz, the Francophile German ambassador to Vichy had also warned that Sauckel was driving the maquis into the resistance with his hardline policies and once joked to Sauckel that the maquis should put up a statue of him with the inscription [...] "To <b>our</b> <b>number</b> one recruitment agent". The French called Sauckel [...] "the slave-trader". Furthermore, as Laval warned, the scale of the problem was beyond Vichy's means to solve. The prefets of the departments of the Lozère, the Hérault, the Aude, the Pyréénées-Orientales, and Aveyron had been given a list of 853 réfractaries to arrest, and managed during the next four months to arrest only 1 réfractarie. After the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army in February 1943, many had started to doubt the inevitability of an Axis victory, and most French gendarmes were not willing to hunt the down the maquis, knowing full well that they might be tried for their actions if the Allies won. Only the men of the Groupe mobile de réserve para-military police force were considered reliable, but the force was too small for the task of hunting down thousands of men. As the Germans as much as possible preferred to subcontract the work of ruling France to the French while retaining ultimate control it was the Milice that was given the task of destroying the maquis. The Milice was in Ousby's words [...] "Vichy's only instrument for fighting the Maquis. Entering the popular vocabulary at more or less the same time, the words maquis and milice together defined the new realities: the one a little-known word for the back country of Corsica, which became a synonym for militant resistance; the other a familiar word meaning simply [...] "militia", which became a synonym for militant repression. The Maquis and the Milice were enemies thrown up by the final chaos of the Occupation, in a sense twins symbiotically linked in a final hunt".|$|E
