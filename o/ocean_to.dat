5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales feed almost {{exclusively}} on krill, though they also take small numbers of copepods. The species of this zooplankton eaten by blue whales varies from <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the usual food; in the North Pacific, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera, Nyctiphanes symplex and Nematoscelis megalops; and in the Southern Hemisphere, Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia valentini, and Nyctiphanes australis.|$|E

5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II the Japanese {{fire balloon}} was {{designed}} as a cheap weapon intended {{to make use of the}} jet stream over the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E

5|$|On {{the orders}} of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels {{under the command of}} {{navigator}} Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi to sail across the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> Calicut.

5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Economic Union {{is located}} at the eastern end of Europe, bounded by the Arctic in the north, the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the east and East Asia, the Middle East and part of Central Asia to the south.

Its member states cover an area of over 20,000,000 square kilometers, which is approximately 15% of the world's land surface.|$|E

5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus Laticauda, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{generally}} used U-boats {{stationed in}} Norway {{to extend its}} range of operation in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The Norwegian bases housed U-boats that {{took part in the}} interception of Allied convoys crossing the Arctic <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union. Following the liberation of France by the Western Allies in 1944, U-boat activity in many Norwegian ports increased. With the French ports captured or cut off, many German U-boats re-located to Norwegian port cities.|$|E
5|$|The family Lipotidae {{is another}} {{monotypic}} taxon, containing only the baiji. Fossil records suggest the dolphin first appeared 25 {{million years ago}} and migrated from the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Yangtze River 20 million years ago. The species was declared functionally extinct in 2006 after an expedition to record population numbers found no specimens.|$|E

5|$|What is now NY86 from Paul Smiths to Jay via Saranac Lake and Lake Placid was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, an auto trail extending across the North American continent from the Pacific <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> the Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from its border with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the <b>ocean</b> <b>to</b> evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>to</b> raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
