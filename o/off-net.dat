On November 5, 1990, CPE folded its first-run syndication unit Guber-Peters Television into Columbia Pictures Television Distribution. On August 7, 1991, CPE {{changed its name to}} Sony Pictures Entertainment and TriStar Television was relaunched on October 10. Throughout the 1990s the studio launched such successful shows as Beakmans World on TLC and CBS in 1992, Mad About You on NBC in 1992, Ricki Lakes talk show in syndication which lasted 11 years, The Nanny on CBS in 1993, Party of Five on FOX, NewsRadio on NBC, Malcolm & Eddie on UPN in 1996, and the short-lived cult animated series The Critic on ABC and FOX in 1994. One of the most successful by far was Seinfeld, a Castle Rock Entertainment production which Columbia distributed in <b>off-net</b> syndication years later. On August 21, 1992, Columbias subsidiary CAT Holdings, Inc. (Columbia Act III Television) and Franklin/Waterman Entertainment created a joint venture called Franklin/Waterman 2. On December 7, 1992, Sony Pictures acquired the Barry & Enright Productions game show library. On May 10, 1993, CPT and MCA TV formed their barter divisions. CPTs barter division was called Columbia Pictures Television Advertising Sales (a.k.a. [...] "Columbia Television Advertising Sales"). The sales division handled series by TriStar Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises; as well as <b>off-net</b> series by Castle Rock Entertainment, HBO Independent Productions, and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment. CPT used other companies such as Group W Productions for Beakmans World, MTVs One World Entertainment for Married... with Children, and Tribune Entertainment for Designing Women.|$|E

When ABC canceled Diff'rent Strokes, the brand name Tandem Productions became dormant but renamed active as an in-name-only division. On November 24, 1986, Coca-Cola fused Embassy's television operations including the movie packages (Embassy Night at the Movies, Embassy II and Embassy III) with Columbia Pictures Television; the combined company became Columbia/Embassy Television, though Columbia and Embassy continued to produce and distribute programs under their separate names. During that formation, Coke took Columbia and Embassy out of the first-run syndication business and had them to focus on first-run network and <b>off-net</b> syndication programming. Married... with Children was the next successful sitcom by Embassy Communications in 1987.|$|E

However, Sony Pictures Television handles <b>off-net</b> syndication reruns by broadcasting them on GSN, while sister company Sony Pictures Home Entertainment owns DVD rights, though, as game shows, are unlikely to get a proper release). Also in 1986, the former Lear units (Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications, and Tandem Productions) were merged to become Embassy Communications; the Tandem unit ceased production to be used after the cancellation of Diff'rent Strokes but remained in-name-only, while the Columbia and Embassy units continued to exist separately. Also on the same year on August 28, CPT acquired Danny Arnold's Four D Productions, Inc. for $50 million. [...] On November 24, 1986, Coca-Cola regrouped CPT, Embassy Communications, and Merv Griffin Enterprises into Coca-Cola Television, and Coke formed a new first-run syndication unit; Coca-Cola Telecommunications due to Coca-Cola merging the distribution unit of Columbia Pictures Television and The Television Program Source (a syndicator that was {{a joint venture between}} Alan Bennett, former King World president Robert King, and CPT that was created on October 15, 1984, which Coca-Cola had a small investment in originally, and notably distributed the 1985-1986 nighttime syndicated version of The Price Is Right and was slated to distribute a new version of The Match Game for syndication in 1987). [...] Coca-Cola Telecommunications also took some programs that were or slated to be distributed under the Columbia Pictures Television banner including What's Happening Now!!, The Real Ghostbusters, Dinosaucers and Punky Brewster as well as taking the US distribution rights of Hardcastle and McCormick from Colex. Punky Brewster, a former NBC in-house production, Columbia acquired the rights to Punky from NBC because fin-syn regulations prevented the network from producing more episodes for syndication after they cancelled it. During the fall of 1986, the sitcom Designing Women began a successful seven-year run on CBS. The same year, Tri-Star Pictures formed Tri-Star Television and produced the short-lived series Downtown. Tri-Star produced more series in 1987, Take Five, Nothing in Common, My Two Dads, Werewolf and Buck James.|$|E

Based on a survey of 1044 students it is demonstrated that some consumers may suffer from a "price differentiation bias", i. e., {{a fair number of}} consumers may overestimate the savings that result from reduced on-net and/or <b>off-net</b> charges, as they do not appear to weigh the prices with the probabilities of placing <b>off-net</b> and on-net calls.

The empirical models use secondary data from the Swedish telecom regulator between 2003 and 2009. The results reveal that incumbents can utilize the size of network together with termination-based price discrimination for attracting new customers. Furthermore, <b>off-net</b> prices of the mobile communications market are significantly determined by size of network and method of calculating termination rate.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of network effects in the consumer’s choice of mobile phone {{operator}} in the UK. For our empirical analysis we use two sources of data: market-level data from OFCOM and micro-level data on consumers ’ usage of mobile telephones from the survey Home Online. We estimate two classes of models which illustrate {{the role of}} network effects. The first {{is a model of}} the comparative volume of on-net and <b>off-net</b> calls. This finds that the proportion of <b>off-net</b> calls falls as mobile operators charge a premium for <b>off-net</b> calls, but {{even in the absence of}} any price differential between on-net and <b>off-net,</b> there is still a form of pure network effect, where a disproportionate number of calls are on-net. The second is a model of the individual consumer’s choice of operator. This finds that individual choice shows considerable inertia, as expected, but is heavily influenced by the choices of others in the same household. There is some evidence that individual choice of operator is influenced by the number of subscribers for each operator. This second model is estimated in two forms: one where network effects and price effects do not interact and the other where they do interact, as suggested by theoretical considerations. We find that the non-interactive form fits the data better than the interactive form, suggesting again that there are some pure network effects at work, independent of price differentials...|$|E

Contrary to previous predictions, jointly profit-maximizing access charges are set above termination cost in order to dampen competition, and the resulting on-net prices are below <b>off-net</b> prices, if calling patterns are sufficiently concentrated. We discuss implications for regulating access charges as well as on- and <b>off-net</b> price discrimination. Network competition; non-uniform calling patterns; termination charge...|$|E

40|$|The off-net-cost pricing {{principle}} {{argues that}} under {{a broad range}} of environments a positive “access ” charge paid by originating networks to interconnected terminating networks would cause networks to set on-net usage charges equal to <b>off-net</b> rates, and that these charges would fully reflect the access charge. However, other results in the literature provide reasonable conditions under which on-net usage charges will not reflect access charges, but would be set to induce the social surplus maximizing level of on-net usage. This paper harmonizes these two apparently opposing results by showing that retail usage charges depend on two effects. One is a rent seeking effect on the part of networks and the other is an efficient utilization effect. In models in which the rent seeking effect is more important, on-net usage charges will tend to equal their <b>off-net</b> usage charges and incorporate the access charge. In models in which the efficient utilization effect matters more, <b>off-net</b> usage charges will reflect access charges, but onnet usage charges will not be affected by the level of access charges, but instead will tend to be set at the levels that promote efficient on-net utilization.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} models of network competition with call externalities demonstrate strategic incentives of incumbent providers to reduce receiver benefits in rival network by excessive <b>off-net</b> pricing. Such anti-competitive pricing practices have a potentially damaging impact on financial standing {{of a late}} entrant, leading to non-convergence of long-run market shares 2 ̆ 013 an outcome that has been observed in many European mobile markets. The theoretical reasoning behind call externalities assumes that receiving calls contribute to consumer utility hence, receiver benefits drive subscription choices. So far no {{attempts have been made}} to test this critical assumption in a rigorous manner. We use data elicited from prepaid and postpaid users of mobile telephony in Poland in a discrete choice experiment designed specifically to model subscription choices when operators set termination-based discriminatory tariffs under calling party pays regime. Receiver benefits are controlled with an incoming price 2 ̆ 013 a variable informing about the cost of <b>off-net</b> calls paid by subscribers originating a call from other networks. The model also accounts for switching costs and network effects. We find that call externalities are significant driver of subscription choices, albeit their influence has smaller magnitude than direct price effects. Next, we assess the impact of excessive <b>off-net</b> pricing on the structure of market shares of mobile operators in Poland and estimate customer base stealing effect encountered by the late entrant. Our empirical findings support a widespread view that call externalities might have indeed limited market competition and late entrants' growth in many European countries...|$|E
