5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the dancers.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Cenotaph, {{opposite}} the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was {{built as a}} memorial to the 580 Stretford men {{who lost their lives}} in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for War.|$|E

Inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> court is {{the text of}} Article 1, Section 1 of the Federal Constitutional Law of Austria: Österreich ist eine demokratische Republik (Austria is a {{democratic}} republic) and [...] Ihr Recht geht vom Volk aus (Its law emanates from the people).|$|R
5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E

50|$|The company’s history {{goes back}} to 1963, when German {{brothers}} Manfred and Klaus Hammes introduced an air filter system for residential coal ovens in Germany. The product was initially sold to help reduce the black dust build-up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> ovens. Soon though, Manfred Hammes, a lifelong asthma sufferer, noticed that the filter reduced his flare-ups during the winter months.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to all of this, BBC2 used in-vision continuity {{for at least the}} first few months of its existence, broadcasting the announcer in studio Pres B, Television Centre. The studio featured a desk with BBC2 branding with the day appearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind,</b> as well as highlights of the upcoming programmes. This practice was abandoned by BBCs 1 and 2 at about the same time, and the studio vacated.|$|E
25|$|The University Chapel was {{constructed}} {{as a memorial}} to the 755 sons of the University who {{had lost their lives}} in the First World War. Designed by Sir John Burnet, it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the University community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of Douglas Strachan, although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.|$|E
25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
40|$|A choir, predominately women, {{is shown}} singing. They are wearing dark robes with sleeves that fold {{back to reveal}} a lining {{matching}} <b>the</b> stolls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> robes. They are holding their music open. A young woman is pictured in the foreground, not singing and wearing a different robe. There are decorations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> choir. The lower {{right corner of the}} photograph is damaged...|$|R

The narrow hallways inside have rounded windows to the outside given the feel of a cabin hallway.|$|R
25|$|His work pleased {{the board}} and they {{assigned}} him to paint frescoes in the large lunettes of {{the walls of the}} chapel. Work began in 1500 and was completed in 1503. (There was a break in 1502 because funds were lacking.) These frescoes in the chapel are considered the most complex and impressive work by Signorelli. He and his school spent two years creating a series of frescoes concerning the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment, starting with the Preaching of the Antichrist, continuing with tumultuous episodes of the End of the World, finding a counterpart in the Resurrection of the Flesh. The fourth scene is a frightening depiction of the Damned taken to Hell and received by Demons. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the altar, Signorelli depicts on the left side the Elect being led to Paradise and on the right side the Reprobates driven to Hell. He added to these expressive scenes some striking details.|$|E
25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, {{who seems to be}} {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E

Two of the men at center are shaking hands as <b>the</b> others look <b>on.</b> Framed portraits can be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> group of men. At left, Frank Wiggins, identified by his large mustache, can be seen. Eddie Daugherty and Sylvester Weaver are also present in the picture, but the caption has been damaged so it does not reveal where they stand...|$|R
50|$|Pruitt Hall is the {{gymnasium}} for volleyball {{as well as}} the men's and women's basketball teams. Coaches' offices can be found inside the building. Major renovations including the locker rooms, bleachers, and floor have been completed in the last few years. A new scorer's table was recently added as well. Logos of the other GSC schools are placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bleachers all around the gym. Concessions are located outside the entrances as spectators walk in the doors. The Summer of 2013 a new floor was put in along with new bleachers with chair-back seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team bench sides.|$|R

25|$|The Jagannath triad {{are usually}} worshipped in the sanctum of the temple, but once {{during the month}} of Asadha (rainy season of Odisha, usually falling on the month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (Puri's main high street) and travel 3km to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots, {{allowing}} the public to have Darshan (i.e., holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the festival (yatra) of the chariots (ratha). The rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct. The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals etc. on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the throne. The huge chariot of Jagannath pulled during Ratha Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word juggernaut. The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha Yatra.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E

Large abstract paintings are visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind.</b> George R. Brown, an industrialist most {{closely associated with the}} firm of Brown and Root, was a student at the William M. Rice Institute, and, along with his wife, a major Houston and Texas philanthropist. Hobby was the director of the WACs during World War II, and the publisher of the Houston Post newspaper. Original resource is a black and white photograph. The Allen Center was dedicated as part of the 1967 Homecoming events...|$|R
500|$|... "People {{talk about}} how horrible {{it is to be}} brought up Catholic, and it's all true. The main thing was that there was no sense of proportion. I would chew a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry with you about that,' and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> her would be a dying, {{bleeding}} guy on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the album}} was first issued, the main back cover photo (taken at a {{performance}} of Warhol's event Exploding Plastic Inevitable) contained an image of actor Eric Emerson projected upside-down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> the band. Having recently been arrested for drug possession and desperate for money, Emerson threatened to sue over this unauthorized use of his image, unless he was paid. Rather than complying, MGM recalled copies of the album and halted its distribution until Emerson's image could be airbrushed from the photo on subsequent pressings. Copies {{that had already been}} printed were sold with a large black sticker covering the actor's image.|$|E
500|$|While {{the plot}} of the episode stands on its own, it also sets up much of the {{continuing}} plot of the series by including Easter eggs for events that do not occur until much later: as Fry falls into the freezer, the scene shows a strange shadow cast <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> him. It is revealed in [...] "The Why of Fry" [...] that the shadow belongs to Nibbler, who intentionally pushes Fry into the freezer as part of a complex plan to save Earth from the Brainspawn in the future. Executive producer David X. Cohen claims that from the very beginning the creators had plans to show a larger conspiracy behind Fry's journey to the future. In the movie , it is revealed that the spacecraft seen destroying the city while Fry is frozen are piloted by Bender and those chasing him after he steals the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

Two portraits are visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> them, depicting a young man and a young woman respectively. Are these the diners in their youth? Below, a detailed rug can be seen. Also, a cabinet with fine plates and a dressing screen can be seen behind the man and woman to the left and right, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|With {{regard to}} the content, the concept that the {{motorcycle}} {{could serve as a}} metaphor for the 20th century was received with interest, but some wondered whether the claim was fulfilled by the appearance of the motorcycles chosen and the way they were presented. The motorcycles shown did, at least, [...] "illustrate technology and taste as they have evolved together in the 20th century, which is an issue basic to modern art." [...] While there were many who lauded Frank Gehrys spare design, with only the reflective stainless steel and a terse string of words <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bikes to evoke the decade they came from, others saw this as shallow or a failure to offer as much insight as the show could have.|$|R
