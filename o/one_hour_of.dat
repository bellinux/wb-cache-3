5|$|McCabe scored 60 of the 70 runs that Australia {{added on}} the second day to finish 187 not out from 233 balls as Australia were bowled out for 360. McCabe added the runs in just <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> batting and ended with 25 {{boundaries}} in his innings, which lasted a little over four hours. He was particularly effectively in farming the strike while batting with his tail end partners; in his last wicket stand of 55 with Tim Wall, he scored 50 of the runs in just half an hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10â€“15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E

25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> singing exercises in their teacher's presence {{and in front of}} a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E

500|$|By {{synchronously}} resetting all clocks in {{a region}} to <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> ahead <b>of</b> standard time (<b>one</b> <b>hour</b> [...] "fast"), individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier {{than they would have}} otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> daylight after their workday activities. However, they will have <b>one</b> fewer <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter.|$|R

The NBC segment, originally known {{by the name of}} its sponsor, The Prince Albert Show, was first hosted by Acuff, who was succeeded by Red Foley from 1946 to 1954. From October 15, 1955 to September 1956, ABC-TV aired a live, hour-long television version once a month on Saturday nights (sponsored by Ralston-Purina), pre-empting <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the then-90-minute Ozark Jubilee. From 1955 to 1957, Al Gannaway owned and produced both The Country Show and Stars of the Grand Ole Opry, filmed programs syndicated by Flamingo Films. Gannaway's Stars of the Grand Ole Opry was the first television show shot in color.|$|E

25|$|Specific antidotes are {{available}} for certain overdoses. For example, Naloxone is the antidote for opiates such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, benzodiazepine overdoses may be effectively reversed with flumazenil. As a nonspecific antidote, activated charcoal is frequently recommended if available within <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the ingestion and the ingestion is significant. Gastric lavage, syrup of ipecac, and whole bowel irrigation are rarely used.|$|E
