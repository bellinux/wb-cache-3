50|$|The Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990 dealt a heavy blow to CCC’s {{operations in the}} Persian Gulf region. The company had to move all of its employees <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> close down its business operations there. However, by the mid-1990s, CCC emerged again as a thriving company after having navigated successfully {{the economic and political}} downturns of the early 1990s growing into the versatile and diversified large international construction company it is today.|$|E
5000|$|Kuwait Entertainment City {{has been}} open {{every year since}} its inaugural season, except for the period during and after Iraq's {{invasion}} and occupation of Kuwait beginning in 1990. From 1990 to 1991, Iraqi Forces took many of the park's rides and shipped them back to Iraq, while also pillaging and vandalizing the park's property. [...] Many of the stolen rides, including the park's Crown Metal Products locomotive and train cars, ended up in Al Zawra’a Dream Park, located in Downtown Baghdad. [...] After Iraqi forces were driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> decisively defeated during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the park began the process of recovery. It finally reopened {{to the public in}} 1994 and has remained open since.|$|E
50|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Kuwait. This act precipitated U.S. {{military}} involvement in the Persian Gulf. As {{part of the general}} mobilization for this conflict that fall, the 2nd and 5th Battalions, 16th Infantry were alerted for deployment on 8 November 1990. The battalions deployed to Saudi Arabia soon after {{with the rest of the}} 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) as part of Operation DESERT SHIELD. Operation DESERT STORM commenced on 17 January 1991 with air raids and artillery barrages on Iraqi targets, while the two battalions continued to rehearse their impending missions to penetrate Iraqi defenses and destroy the Republican Guard in zone. Concurrently, the 4th Battalion, 16th Infantry, which had deployed from Germany to the port of Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was busy supporting the war effort as well by assisting the unloading of support vessels arriving with additional combat vehicles and supplies. On the morning of 24 February 1991 the Big Red One spearheaded the armored attack into Iraq, by creating a massive breach in the enemy defenses just inside Iraq. The breach was designed to allow other VII US Corps units to pass through the initial Iraqi Army forces and drive deep into Iraq. In the initial assault the 1st Infantry Division broke through the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division, destroyed it, and took over 2,500 prisoners. In the initial stages of the operation, that is just before, during, and after the breach made in the 2nd Brigade’s sector, the major problem faced by the Rangers of the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry was not so much enemy fire (though that was a hindrance) as was the large number of Iraqi soldiers surrendering to the troops of the battalion. By darkness of the 24th, the Rangers had not only conducted a major breach into the Iraqi defensive zone, they had also penetrated 30 kilometers to Phase Line Colorado and captured some 600 enemy troops. The following morning, the 2nd Battalion pushed on with the 2nd Brigade and quickly battled through the Iraqi 48th Infantry Division capturing its commander and destroying its command post. By the end of that day, the brigade had cut through and destroyed the Iraqi 25th Division as well and had reached Phase Line Utah where it took up a temporary defensive position. After its breaching operations, the Big Red One’s 1st Brigade, consisting in part of the 5th Battalion, 16th Infantry and the 2nd Battalion 34th Armor, turned east and drove deep into enemy territory toward Phase Line Utah. En route on the 25th, the Iron Rangers also encountered a number of enemy formations, most notably the 110th Infantry Brigade. In a brief skirmish, that brigade’s commander was scooped up by soldiers of the battalion. Like its brother battalion, the 5th Battalion was rounding up hundreds of enemy prisoners who had no fight left in them by this time. Ahead however, was the much vaunted Republican Guard known to be positioned at a place on the map called Objective NORFOLK. On the night of 26 February 1991, the 1st Brigade next collided with the Republican Guard’s Tawalakana Division and the 37th Brigade, 12th Armored Division. The fight developed into a division-level battle and before dawn the Big Red One had destroyed both enemy formations. Enemy losses included more than 40 tanks and 40 infantry fighting vehicles. The 1st Infantry Division continued to exploit its success on the 27th by capturing and pursuing the demoralized Iraqi forces for the rest of the day. Following the Battle of Objective NORFOLK, the 5th Battalion raced ahead to assist in cutting the Iraqi lines of retreat from Kuwait City. As it approached the highway moving north out of Kuwait City and into southern Iraq, the Big Red One destroyed scores of enemy vehicles and took thousands more prisoners as the division’s units advanced. About 2000, 27 February, the division’s 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, seized the main highway leading north <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> barred the Iraqis’ escape. By the next morning, the rest of the division had taken up positions along the highway completely blocking any further movement north by the Iraqi Army. The cease fire was announced at 0800 on 28 February and the war was essentially over. While the Rangers of the 2nd Battalion were ordered to move over the ground just taken and destroy any remaining Iraqi vehicles and equipment that could be located in the rear, the 5th Battalion was ordered to the vicinity of Safwan Airfield in Iraq. There, the Iron Rangers were tasked with securing the site where on 3 March 1991 the negotiations were held between coalition forces and Iraqi leaders to finalize the cease-fire agreements. In this conflict the regiment earned 4 campaign streamers and each of the 2nd and 5th Battalions earned a Valorous Unit Award Streamer embroidered IRAQ-KUWAIT. On 10 May 1991, the division unfurled its colors at Fort Riley, Kansas, signifying its return home.|$|E

The US Army received orders by General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. to not let anybody in or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> City <b>and</b> to effectively blockade the retreating Iraqi convoys within a 100-mile radius.

40|$|The {{residency}} programme developed {{further the}} previous research projects Out of Britain and <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> involved working directly with Saudi Arabian artists supporting research and reflection upon {{the landscape of}} Saudi Arabia, the social - political, geographical and psychological. The programme also explored the history of how artist's local or vernacular spaces have been given form through painting, film, photography and performance. Also how national and regional art educational institutions across the Gulf have shaped artists in their reflections of their immediate environments. The programme attracted artists from the Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait City, and the Oman. The residency programme was designed by Professor David Rayson assisted by three RCA Painting Graduates, and took place over ten days in Jeddah. The residency schedule included visits to local environments in and around Jeddah, and journeys out into the desert between Jeddah and Mecca. These visits were followed by in depth discussions and art workshops, and artists talk surgeries. Also scheduled were visits to key public and commercial galleries and educational institutions. There were also presentations of previous research and artist talks by Professor David Rayson at local Universities and presentations to the residency artists by the RCA graduates. This collaborative research was conducted towards planning another series of major exhibitions and a future publication funded through the British Council and associated partners. As the Gulf region begins to open up culturally to the west, these collaborations and research are significant in developing knowledge and collaborative research...|$|E

5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared to}} deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iraq <b>and</b> <b>Kuwait</b> was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|R
