40|$|Background: In vitro and in vivo {{analyses}} differ {{between the}} number of milk ducts found in the lactating breast, and {{there is a lack of}} knowledge as to whether or not external factors in the mother or the child affect the number of ductal <b>orifices.</b> The aim of this study was to determine the number of milk duct <b>orifices</b> in vivo and to investigate the possible influence of variable parameters in mother and infant. Methods: Study design: Prospective clinical trial. In 98 breastfeeding women we investigated the nipple surface in order to identify the number of milk duct <b>orifices</b> using Marmet’s manual milk expression technique. In addition mothers were interviewed on different parameters of birth and breastfeeding. Results: Every nipple had 3. 90 [*]±[*] 1. 48 milk duct <b>orifices</b> on average. There was no significant difference between left and right breasts. The use of a breast pump in addition to breastfeeding did not have any effect on the number of ductal <b>orifices.</b> Multiparous women exhibited more ductal <b>orifices</b> (8. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 0) as compared to primipara (7. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 7). Boys were associated with significantly more ductal <b>orifices</b> in their mother’s right breast (4. 2 [*]±[*] 1. 7) than girls (3. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 4). Furthermore boys were breastfed for longer per session. A shorter birth height of males correlated with more ductal <b>orifices</b> in left nipples. Fluid intake of mothers was associated with a higher number of ductal <b>orifices.</b> Restless infant behavior could not be explained by less milk duct <b>orifices.</b> Pain in the breast during breastfeeding did not have an influence on ductal <b>orifices</b> either. Psychological criteria, such as duration of maternity leave and total intended breastfeeding period, did not affect the number of <b>orifices</b> in the papilla mammaria of breasts during lactation. Conclusion: For the first time an in vivo investigation of the number of ductal <b>orifices</b> in lactating women was conducted non-invasively and associations with variables in the mother and the child, birth parameters in infants, and breastfeeding parameters in mothers and children were assessed. We conclude that the number of activated ductal <b>orifices</b> on the surface of the nipple is primarily associated with functional aspects...|$|R
5|$|The {{mouth is}} ventral {{and a little}} behind {{the front of the}} body. The foregut, stomach and {{intestine}} run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is {{at the tip of the}} tail.

40|$|The {{inner surface}} of the ovarian bursa in the golden hamster was {{observed}} by scanning electron microscopy. There were numerous discontinuities in the bursal epithelium. Crevice-like gaps were formed between irregularly spaced epithelial cells, and the subepithelial connective tissue was exposed to the bursal cavity through the gaps. Through circular defects in the epithelial lining or pores, which were less than 20 microns in diameter, either the subepithelial connective tissue or stomatal <b>orifices</b> were visible. There were smooth surfaced areas lined with lymphatic endothelium, instead of bursal epithelium, which was continuous from {{the wall of the}} lymphatic vessel to the inner {{surface of the}} bursa. These areas were not present in all bursae, but if they were present, stomatal <b>orifices</b> consistently opened in them. Stomata in the ovarian bursa had two types of <b>orifices,</b> (1) circular <b>orifices</b> opening predominantly in smooth surfaced areas and measuring up to 50 microns in diameter; (2) jagged <b>orifices</b> opening usually in pores and measuring less than 10 microns in diameter. Blood cell components derived from ovulation entered lymphatics via stomata. Bursal fluid and small particles may drain into lymphatics directly via stomata and indirectly by diffusion through gaps, pores and connective tissue. Judging from the structural appearance of the stomatal <b>orifices,</b> the degree of opening of jagged <b>orifices</b> may change in response to changes in the cavity, while circular <b>orifices</b> may be stable openings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ion-conducting pore of {{potassium}} channels, which can {{open and close}} to regulate ion passage, was at long {{thought to be a}} one-dimensional pore structure with a water-filled central cavity. Here, we find four <b>orifices</b> in the KcsA potassium channel, which are perpendicular to the pore and stretch out from the cavity. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations show that water molecules can flow between the cavity and <b>orifices.</b> Targeted molecular dynamics simulations show that during the opening process, water molecules can move into the cavity through the <b>orifices</b> to facilitate channel gating, whereas blocking the aqueduct <b>orifices</b> makes the channel difficult to open...|$|R
5|$|The cervix was {{documented}} in anatomical literature {{in at least}} the time of Hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both Hippocrates and Aretaeus.

5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an <b>orifice,</b> the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve <b>orifice</b> of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the combined occluding effect of fluor protector and Nd:YAG Laser irradiation on human dentinal tubules. METHODS: Twenty-four dentin specimens with exposed dentinal tubule <b>orifices</b> treated by 37 % H 3 PO 4 were randomly {{divided into four}} groups. Group B, C and D were vanished by fluor protector, group A served as a control. Group D was lased by Nd:YAG laser. Group C and D were brushed with normal force. RESULTS: Under SEM, group A showed numerous exposed dentinal tubule <b>orifices,</b> the diameter of which is 2 - 3 microns. Group B showed closure of dentinal tubule <b>orifices.</b> Group C showed {{that most of the}} fluor protector were brushed away and group D showed over 80 % of the dentinal tubule <b>orifices</b> were occluded.

5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head <b>orifice,</b> or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination <b>orifice.</b> It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second <b>orifice.</b> The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees.

It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the <b>orifice</b> between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like <b>orifice</b> from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common <b>orifice</b> of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E

5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's <b>orifice</b> and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the <b>orifice</b> produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged <b>orifice</b> with split lips.|$|E

The numerical results obtained show that performance characteristics are related to bearing design type. An experimental investigation allows us to analyze the behavior of thrust air bearings with several <b>orifices</b> as well as that of groove or porous material bearings. Frequency response measurements have been realized in order to compare the dynamic properties of the different bearings. The frequency responses obtained demonstrate that air bearings with multiple <b>orifices</b> have a damping higher than the other types in certain conditions. Air bearings with multiple <b>orifices</b> offer many advantages from a dynamic point of view.
