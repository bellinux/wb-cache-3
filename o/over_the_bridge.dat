5|$|The bridge {{features}} two {{ranges of}} shops {{designed in the}} Palladian style c.1770, between them forming a narrow street <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The street and buildings sit above three segmental arches of equal span.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|At the Nyack line, NY59 becomes {{known as}} Main Street. As Main Street, NY59 runs under the Thruway one final {{time before the}} Thruway heads <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The route {{continues}} toward downtown Nyack; however, it ends at an intersection with US9W before it reaches the central district. Main Street continues for several blocks into downtown Nyack.|$|E

5|$|Passenger train {{services}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> declined significantly {{after the}} Ruabon to Barmouth line via Llangollen and Dolgellau was closed in 1965, causing all traffic {{to take the}} longer and slower route from Shrewsbury via Machynlleth and Dovey Junction. The old trackbed from Morfa Mawddach railway station to Dolgellau now forms the Mawddach Trail, a walk and cycle trail.|$|E
5|$|A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is {{the only}} {{reminder}} of the Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once continued on <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 2003, {{the last}} ever Concorde flight (Concorde 216) flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> before landing at Filton Aerodrome. In April 2006, {{the bridge was}} the centrepiece of the Brunel 200 weekend, celebrating the 200th anniversary {{of the birth of}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel. At the climax of the celebration a {{firework}} display was launched from the bridge. The celebrations also saw the activation of an LED-based lighting array to illuminate the bridge.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Børøy <b>Bridge</b> and Hadsel Bridge connect Stokmarknes to {{the island}} of Langøya to the north. Stokmarknes Airport, Skagen is located on Langøya, just <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> from Stokmarknes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Chenab <b>Bridge</b> was {{originally}} intended {{to be completed in}} December 2009. However, in September 2008 the project was halted due to fears <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> stability and safety.|$|R
5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full New London service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for {{a certain period of}} time to allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of {{children}} in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) in The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894–1898) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> However, there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Further {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1927 with waters running nearly 6 ft <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Inkerman <b>Bridge</b> and 3 ft <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Burdekin <b>Bridge,</b> <b>the</b> river {{reached its peak}} at 66 ft above summer levels at Sellheim.|$|R

25|$|The {{commission}} {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> engineer, Micha Bar-Ilan, did not submit {{a blueprint for}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> designed a bridge that was inadequate for its intended use, and did not properly supervise or coordinate <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> construction. <b>The</b> commission faulted the Maccabiah Games' organizers for poor coordination and oversight <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge's</b> assembly.|$|R
5|$|Beyond this interchange, {{the route}} comes to two-way toll plaza {{and has a}} U-turn ramp from the {{southbound}} direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route’s signage changes from northsouth to eastwest. Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west {{and returns to the}} Curtis Creek drawbridges.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, having {{delivered}} the Scottish embassy to Newcastle, left there on 14 May, either with Lords Greystoke and Willoughby or picking them up en route with other supporters, {{to seek out}} the Lancastrians. The next day, at Hexham- having crossed the Tyne 'either at Bulwell or Corbridge'- he attacked the rebels in their camp which was {{on the south side of}} Devil's Water river. Montagu, his army swelled with new recruits from Newcastle, and men raised by Montagu's brother, the Archbishop of York, may have had up to 10,000 men. Leading his army 'forward at the charge,' Montagu's attack soon became a rout, with the Lancastrian army dissolving and attempting escape <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Lords Roos, Hungerford, Findern, and Tallboys survived the battle only to be executed, on Montagu's order- and probably in his presence- with the Duke of Somerset in Newcastle. Following Hexham, Montagu ordered the largest number of beheadings the civil wars had yet seen.|$|E

60|$|The wagons {{had already}} gone <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> to <b>the</b> spot {{selected}} for the camp, and now the battalion marched across, from island to island, under low arching trees and over ground covered with fallen leaves and moss.|$|R
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed to}} carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily supported by trestles until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E

5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and the flight deck was extended between them and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use the flight deck. A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from the flight deck on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, the SER {{secretary}} Samuel Smiles {{looked for}} potential routes and decided the best location {{would be on}} the site of the former Hungerford Market adjacent to The Strand, and that the line should be directly connected to Waterloo, allowing a link with London and South Western Railway services. The Charing Cross Railway Company was formed in 1859 in order to build the extension, and the SER paid £300,000 (now £) in capital to help build this. The line towards Charing Cross was expensive to build as it traversed a heavily built-up area, which was exacerbated in 1862 when the company chose to upgrade the two running lines to three, and doubled the capacity <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to four tracks. The bridge replaced the original suspension bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel which opened in 1845. Work began in June 1860 and took around three years. The old suspension bridge remained open until the new bridge was suitable to carry foot traffic. A trial run over the new line took place on 1 December 1863.|$|E
