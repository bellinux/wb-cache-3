5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E

25|$|This {{tax fraud}} filing, related to Pinochet's {{and his family}} secret bank {{accounts}} in the United States and in Caribbean islands, for an amount of USD $27million, shocked the Pinochetist sector of the Chilean public opinion more than the accusations of human rights abuses. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and would essentially have come from weapons traffic (when purchasing Belgian Mirage fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch Léopard tanks, Swiss Mowag tanks or by illegal sales of weapons to Croatia, {{in the middle of}} the Balkan war; the later case has been connected by the Chilean justice with the assassination of Colonel Gerardo Huber in 1992).

500|$|Foreign reviewers {{also gave}} the film {{generally}} positive reviews; Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter {{called it a}} [...] "Warm story from frigid Norway". Varietys Alissa Simon wrote that it [...] "lacks the fully developed characters and tightly constructed narrative of his more poignant and substantial Kitchen Stories", but that it [...] "nevertheless provides a warm and gently humorous divertissement". She also found the production and score excellent. James Rocchi, writing for Cinematical, chose to highlight Bård Owe's performance, and his [...] "warm demeanor" [...] and meticulous [...] "capacity for double-takes". Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum compared <b>Owe</b> <b>to</b> Jack Nicholson's Warren Schmidt in the film About Schmidt. Like others, she also used Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki as a reference to describe Hamer's particular cinematic style.|$|E

500|$|Further, Garner {{suggests}} that Cochrane is [...] "perhaps unduly uncritical {{of the utility}} of employing justice {{as a means to}} protect the interests of animals". He outlines two ways that animals might be protected without being the recipients of justice; first, they may be owed direct duties outside of justice, or, second, they might be protected by means of indirect duties, meaning that they are protected because of what humans <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> one another. Despite raising these themes in his review of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, Garner later rejected both possibilities in his own work, arguing that animals should be considered recipients of justice. Rasmussen felt that Cochrane utilised a narrow account of the political, meaning that a range of feminist, post-colonial and post-humanist perspectives were ignored in the book.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just {{take a little bit of}} it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.|$|E
500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As far as I know, in no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, but that I did not secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E

500|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership, he was convinced {{of the need for}} rearmament, and was the driving force behind Defence White Papers advocating rearmament in 1936 and 1937. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's traditional bulwark, the English Channel was no defence against air power. Rearmament was an unpopular policy in Britain, and Labour attacked Chamberlain as a warmonger. Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee spoke against the 1936 Budget as tremendously overspending on defence: [...] "Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death." [...] Churchill also criticised the National Government's defence plans, though he called for an even faster buildup. Despite the sniping from both sides, Chamberlain was very concerned about the expense of rearmament, [...] "What a frightful bill we do <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> Master Hitler, damn him! If it only wasn't for Germany, we should be having such a wonderful time just now." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen studied Renaissance {{polyphony}} closely, {{which accounts}} {{for some of the}} melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his Tre Motetter (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciacaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote [...] "The intervals, as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music... t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{husbandry}} {{spread quickly}} in [...] Europe. Excavations {{show that in}} about 6000 BC, during the Neolithic period of prehistory, [...] the Castelnovien people, living around Châteauneuf-les-Martigues near present-day Marseille {{in the south of}} France, [...] were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep. Practically from its inception, ancient Greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals. Scandinavian sheep of a type seen today — with short tails and multi-colored fleece — were also present early on. Later, the Roman Empire kept sheep on a wide scale, and the Romans were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising through much of Europe. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (Naturalis Historia), speaks at length about sheep and wool. Declaring [...] "Many thanks, too, do we <b>owe</b> <b>to</b> the sheep, both for appeasing the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece.", he goes on to detail the breeds of ancient sheep and the many colors, lengths and qualities of wool. Romans also pioneered the practice of blanketing sheep, in which a fitted coat (today usually of nylon) is placed over the sheep to improve the cleanliness and luster of its wool.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> leptospirosis {{is associated}} with a high mortality.
