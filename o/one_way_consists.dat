To reduce the resulting additional bit cost, <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> on using intra predictive coding.

The reduced cost allows selected inter and intra transform coefficients to be combined, to realize a tradeoff between rate, quality and resilience. The simulations with improved intra prediction show that large calculation efforts can be reduced and that a small amount of intra information is sufficient to improve coding resiliency. I...|$|E

However, the BRDF is a complex function since it has four angular degrees of freedom and also depends on the wavelength. The direct use of BRDF data set may be inefficient for scene modelling algorithms for example.

The second harmonic signal is time reversed, frequency shifted by a demodulation and sent in the medium. In this study, the nonlinear components could be increased by 15 dB in comparison to the time reversal process and conventional imaging. Moreover, the SNR can be increased by 7 dB.

Conversely, an optimistic (max-max expected utility) decision maker will be credulous when learning good news but incredulous when learning bad news. It allows max-min (or max-max) expected utility preferences to be dynamically consistent but it violates consequentialism because conditioning works with respect to counterfactual outcomes.

Nevertheless, supplementation of an oligopeptide-enriched wheat peptone improved cell growth by up to 30 % and IFN-γ production by up to 60 % in shake-flask experiments.

Since the backscattered nonlinearities are a function of the transmitted signal, enhancing these nonlinearities means to find the best excitation. In order to reach the solution, <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> in modeling the ultrasound system by parallel subsystems (one channel per harmonic component). Therefore finding the optimal wave for harmonic generation means to create a matched filter for each channel. Time reversal process is well-known to optimize the transmitted wave thanks a physical matched filter. However, it is not well-adjusted, since the time reversed signal will be composed of the second harmonic components and the nonlinearities will double the frequency. Therefore, the harmonic backscattering will thus be due to a linear process and so will not optimize the nonlinearity generation. Our objectives is thus to find the optimal wave to locally optimize the harmonic generation by taking into account this frequency doubling and without increasing the transmit power. As described by the time reversal, the first wave at 2 MHz propagates to the medium. The backscattered signals came mainly from high impedance inclusion behind another inclusion. The backscattered second harmonic components at 4 MHz are extracted from a Hammerstein model. The second harmonic signal is time reversed and then frequency shifted at the fundamental frequency (2 MHz) by two steps. First, the phase is evaluated from the second harmonic signal. Second, the second harmonic signal is demodulated with the phase estimated previously. Finally, the time reversed signal is retro-propagated. In this study, it is shown that the nonlinear components can be increased by 15 dB in comparison to the time reversal process and conventional imaging. Moreover, the SNR can be increased by 7 dB. By maximizing the harmonic generation, the nonlinear time reversed waves focus better on the inclusion and wave coherence is preserved. From this point of view, the optimization process can be viewed {{as an extension of the}} time reversal principle to nonlinearites.
