Bulldozers were used to demolish buildings around the mosque. In 1992, when it was completed, the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> became 1.7 million square feet. Escalators and 27 courtyards were among the additions to the mosque.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mosque {{was built}} to commemorate {{military}} campaigns against the Maratha king Shivaji Bhonsle, although construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> exhausted the Mughal treasury and weakened the Mughal state. As {{a symbol of the}} mosque's importance, it was built directly across from the Lahore Fort and its Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently built by Aurangzeb during construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar {{and a number}} of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Amir Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya, was built along the northwest wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque.</b> Portions of the wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339-1340, would also impact the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque,</b> and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The {{first phase of the}} project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque.</b> Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|The other {{buildings}} erected nearby {{at that time}} have since disappeared, but the monumental access gate and portico in the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque</b> are preserved from the original structure.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, al-Masjid al-Aqsa {{referred}} {{not only}} to the mosque, but to the entire sacred sanctuary, while al-Jami' al-Aqsa referred to the specific site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mosque.</b> This changed during the period of Ottoman rule (c. early 16th century to 1917) when the sanctuary complex {{came to be known as}} al-Haram al-Sharif.|$|E
