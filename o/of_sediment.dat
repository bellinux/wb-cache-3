5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow <b>of</b> <b>sediment</b> into the estuary.

40|$|Summary It {{is not yet}} {{discussed}} whether ground penetration radar (GPR) {{is applicable}} for detecting the sediments {{at the bottom of}} water or not, and also the electromagnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>sediments.</b> This research tries to discuss this problem by model test and field investigation. From model test, the relative dielectric constant (), the density (), the volumetric water content (), the pore ratio (e) <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> and the propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave () in sediments are analyzed. The relationship of － or －, － or －, － or －, － and －e are also established. Using the results <b>of</b> fine grain <b>sediments</b> from model test and field investigation, the relative parameters and their relationship are prepared. The results <b>of</b> sandy <b>sediments</b> from model test coincide with that from wet sandy soils before. The results <b>of</b> fine grain <b>sediments</b> have a great difference from that of fine grain soils. This difference is caused by the great difference in volumetric water content. Because of the change in void ratio <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> at the bottom of water can be reflected by volumetric water content or density, therefore it can also be reflected by relative dielectric constant. Consolidation <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> by its own weight, increasing with the accumulated height(y), decreases the void ratio or volumetric water content, and can also be expressed by relative dielectric constant and height <b>of</b> <b>sediments.</b> According to the magnitude of relative dielectric constant <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> and the reflection configuration in GPR profile, the sedimentation time and the kind of materials can be known. The depth of investigation is limited by two factors, the great relative dielectric constant <b>of</b> water and <b>sediments</b> and the conductivity <b>of</b> fine grain <b>sediments.</b> In this research, as the depth <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> greater than 100 cm, or the depth of water less than 130 cm, the resolution of GPR profile becomes decrease. Because of the relationships between the electromagnetic properties and the physical properties <b>of</b> <b>sediments,</b> the field investigation for the physical properties <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> can be conducted easily. Known the dielectric constant <b>of</b> <b>sediments,</b> its depth, volume, and density are also known. Therefore, this result can be used for sediments remove project and studying the sedimentary course after a flood event. 中文摘要 透地雷達(GPR) 是一種應用極廣之地球物理工具，但是目前尚未有利用GPR探測水底淤積泥砂之探討，包括GPR之應用與淤積泥砂之電磁特性。本文應用模型試驗與現地調查來探討此問題。 利用獲自模型試驗中砂質與細粒沈積物之各項測定值與GPR點測記錄，分析沈積柱之相對介電常數() 或電磁波在沈積柱中之傳播速度() 水量() ，或空隙比(e) ，及密度() ，並利用這些資料建立 － 或 － ， － 或 － ， － 或 － ，及 － 與 －e關係。利用獲自模型試驗中細粒沈積物與野外調查細粒沈積物所得之結果，進行如上之分析並建立細粒沈積物相關參數間之關係。 獲自模型試驗砂質沈積柱結果大致上與前人研究潮濕砂質土壤之結果相符，但是獲自細粒沈積物之結果郤與前人研究細粒土壤之結果有極大之差異，此差異係來自容積含水量之變化。由於水面下沈積泥砂空隙比或容積含水量與密度之變化反映在相對介電常數之變化，因此可用相對介電常數來表示沈積物之空隙比或容積含水量或密度。 沈積物之自重會使其本身產生壓密，使孔隙變小，即容積含水量變小或密度變大，反映出之電磁特性是相對介電常數變小或電磁波速度加快。持續淤積之沈積物，其壓密情況可用相對介電常數與持續累積之厚度(y) 表示。根據相對介電常數之大小與GPR剖面記錄中之反射組態可知悉沈積時間之久暫與沈積材料種類。 調查深度主要受到兩項因子限制，即水與沈積物之相對介電常數都相當大，和細粒沈積物之導電度。在本文中，使用 70 MHz之頻率，當細粒淤積厚度累積至 100 cm以上，即水深小於 130 cm時，GPR記錄之解析度開始降低。 由淤積物之相對介電常數或電磁波波速，可知淤積物之密度，容積含水量或空隙比，對簡化一般之調查工作極有幫助。精確之相對介電常數可得精確之淤積厚度，即表示可得精確之沉積物體積，已知密度則可知淤積物之荷重，因此本研究結果可供淤積物清運計量擬定之用或調查洪水後淤積之情形。封面 中文摘要 英文摘要 目錄 圖目錄 表目錄 一. 緒論 1. 1 前言 1. 2 研究動機與目的 二. 文獻回顧 2. 1 電磁波傳播與GPR偵測原理 2. 2 訊號處理目的與方法 2. 3 電磁波頻率與穿透深度之關係 2. 4 電磁波傳播速度與標的物位置之推求 2. 5 電磁波特性與土壤含水量之關係 2. 6 GPR之應用 三. 研究方法與步驟 3. 1 研究流程 3. 2 試驗設備 3. 3 資料處理 3. 4 野外調查 3. 5 野外試驗雷達記錄剖面與校準點波譜分析 3. 6 粒徑分析 3. 7 密度 、容積含水量及空隙比e 3. 8 野外調查資料迴歸分析與參數檢定 四. 結果與討論 4. 1 模型試驗之結果 4. 2 模型試驗結果之討論 4. 3 模型試驗之結論 4. 4 野外試驗結果 五. 結論與建議 5. 1 結論 5. 2 建議 六. 參考文...|$|R

40|$|Radium {{diffusion}} from sediments to overlying {{water is}} one of the important sources of radium isotopes in ocean water. A series of laboratory desorption/diffusion experiments were conducted to help elucidate the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> on 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption and diffusion, which included 1) 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption from <b>sediments</b> in water <b>of</b> different salinities, 2) 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption from <b>sediments</b> <b>of</b> different grain sizes in water of the same salinity, 3) 224 Ra and 226 Ra diffusive fluxes by observing Ra enrichment with time in the overlying water <b>of</b> incubated <b>sediments.</b> The experimental results show that there is an increase in the amount of 224 Ra and 226 Ra with the increase of salinity from 5 to 30, and Ra desorption is strongest at the salinity of 25. Under the same salt water condition, 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption activities of the four grain sizes (2000 ~ 1000 μm, 1000 ~ 500 μm, 500 ~ 250 μm and 250 ~ 125 μm) <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> are very close to each other. When the grain sizes <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> are larger than 2000 μm, the 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption activities are slightly higher than those <b>of</b> the <b>sediments</b> <b>of</b> the above-mentioned four grain sizes. When the grain sizes <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> are less than 125 μm, the 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption activities are much larger than those of the above-mentioned five grain sizes.

Outcrops can be seen along the front of the Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills.
