5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the <b>other</b> <b>boats,</b> and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the <b>other</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 38houses in Japan were destroyed, 110were damaged, {{and more than}} 2,000were flooded. Landslides were {{observed}} at 56 locations. Power was lost to 160,000families. A total of 165flights were cancelled, delaying 15,000 passengers. A total of 160 trains were cancelled. Two bullet train lines experienced delays in Kyushu; ferry and air service were also delayed there. Offshore, ten fishing boats sunk, including one Japanese cargo ship. An additional 12ships were rendered as missing. Ninety-five <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> took refuge in North Korea, though 59left on September2 to return to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Upon forming {{and moving}} {{parallel}} to India's west coastline, the storm dropped rainfall in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and neighboring Goa. The {{threat of the}} storm prompted schools to be closed around Mumbai. Later, it brushed Gujarat with heavy rainfall and gusty winds. About 50boats were stranded amid high seas, and 11 <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> were left missing from the Veraval port. During {{the height of the}} storm, 320fishermen were unaccounted for, spurring the Indian navy to launch search and rescue missions.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Americans arrived at Île-aux-Noix, Fort St. Jean was defended by about 750 men {{under the command of}} Major Charles Preston. The {{majority}} of these were regular troops from the 7th and 26th Regiments of Foot and the Royal Artillery. There were 90 locally raised militia, and 20 members of Colonel Allen Maclean's Royal Highland Emigrants, men who were veterans of the French and Indian War. A detachment of Indians (probably Caughnawaga from a nearby village) patrolled outside the fort under the direction of Claude de Lorimier and Gilbert Tice. The Richelieu River was patrolled by an armed schooner, , under the command of Lieutenant William Hunter, with <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> under construction.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UB I {{boats were}} shipped to their port of {{operations}} by rail, where they were assembled, launched, tested, and commissioned. Information on UB-14 suggests that she may not have followed that pattern as closely as most <b>other</b> <b>boats.</b> According to several sources, UB-14 was launched on 23 March 1915, and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-14 on 25 March {{under the command of}} Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Those same sources are silent on UB-14s whereabouts at the time, but information on UB-14 later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning may have occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon. Castañeda had {{been instructed to}} avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, {{they found that the}} settlers had removed the ferry and all <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> from the Guadalupe River. On {{the other side of the}} swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E

5000|$|Canal boats up to 3.5 ft in draft {{were pulled}} by horses and mules on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, {{generally}} {{on the north}} side. When canal boats met, the boat with {{the right of way}} remained on the towpath side of the canal. The <b>other</b> <b>boat</b> steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or [...] "hoggee", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the <b>other</b> <b>boat</b> moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat decelerated on with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the <b>other</b> <b>boat's</b> towline, with their horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the <b>other</b> <b>boat's</b> team would continue on its way.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> under construction. As a result, none of the first four boats was ever launched or completed {{before the end of}} the war. U-107 was 35% complete at war's end, while U-108 was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had not started on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the pair of incomplete boats of the U-107 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> under construction. As a result, none {{of the first three}} boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the rest were cancelled before any were laid down. U-101 was 47% complete at war's end, while U-102 and U-103 were only 30% and 10% complete, respectively. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the three incomplete boats of the U-101 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped in 1919 and 1920.|$|E

5|$|The {{island of}} Dominica {{suffered}} severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, {{with a population}} of 450, was cut {{off from the rest of}} the country as roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> sank.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} soldiers mustered and awaited their officers' orders. Salmond ordered Colonel Seton to send men to {{the chain}} pumps; sixty were directed to this task, sixty more {{were assigned to the}} tackles of the lifeboats, and the rest were assembled on the poop deck in order to raise the forward part of the ship. The women and children were placed in the ship's cutter, which lay alongside. Two <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> were manned, but one was immediately swamped and the other could not be launched due to poor maintenance and paint on the winches, leaving only three boats available. The two large boats, with capacities of 150 men each, were not among them.|$|E
5|$|USS Philadelphia is a gunboat (referred to in {{contemporary}} documents as a gundalow or gondola) of the Continental Navy. Manned by Continental Army soldiers, {{she was part}} of a fleet under the command of General Benedict Arnold that fought the 11 October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island against a larger Royal Navy fleet on Lake Champlain. Although many of the American boats in the battle were damaged in the battle, Philadelphia {{was one of the few}} actually sunk that day. On the days following the main battle, most of the <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> in the American fleet were sunk, burned, or captured. She is one of a few such vessels used during the American Revolutionary War to be raised.|$|E

5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; {{a gust of}} 99mph (160km/h) was reported in Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was still missing over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team {{to search for the}} boat. Many <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the rapid {{population}} growth, cholera became a significant problem. In 1849, a major cholera epidemic killed nearly 5,000 people, leading to a new sewer system and the draining of a mill pond. Cemeteries were removed to the outskirts to Bellefontaine Cemetery and Calvary Cemetery to reduce groundwater contamination. In the same year, a large fire broke out on a steamboat on the levee, spread to 23 <b>other</b> <b>boats,</b> and destroyed {{a large portion of the}} center city. The St. Louis landing was significantly improved during the 1850s. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri to eliminate sand bars that threatened the landing. Another infrastructure improvement was the city's water system, which was begun in the early 1830s and was continually improved and expanded in the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with {{a single}} population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is {{considered}} to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or <b>other</b> <b>boats</b> visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Fires of tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.|$|E
