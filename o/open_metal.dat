5|$|The station, {{owned by}} British Rail, opened on 1 May 1972. Services were {{operated}} by the Western Region until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the InterCity and Regional Railways divisions. The original structures, built by Stone & Co. of Bristol, were basic – two island platforms connected by an <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the modern platform 3), {{on the north side}} of the tracks, was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. The station opened with a 600-space car park and a fastest journey to London of 95 minutes, which was subsequently reduced to 75 minutes with the introduction of the new High Speed Trains in the mid-70s. Platform canopies were added in 1973, along with a cover for the footbridge. Further minor improvements were implemented over the next thirty years, including a new booking office and small extensions to the car park.|$|E

It has relatively strong metal-hydrogen interactions, attributed to a spin state change upon binding or to a classical Coulombic attraction.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Kennedy-Warren {{when it opened in}} 1931 was its air-cooling system. Three {{enormous}} fans drew cool air from Klingle Park {{at the back of the}} building and forced it through the public corridors. Residents could then <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> louvers above their hallway doors to cool individual apartments. Cross-ventilation during temperate weather was so effective that doorstops were required to prevent doors from slamming closed if left ajar. Advertisements for the Kennedy-Warren showed that the air was at least ten degrees cooler than on Connecticut Avenue. The fans were removed during the 2009–11 renovation after central air conditioning was installed.|$|E

25|$|High {{hydrogen}} adsorption enthalpy is also important. Theoretical {{studies have}} shown that 22-25kJ/mol interactions are ideal for hydrogen storage at room temperature, as they are strong enough to adsorb H2, but weak enough to allow for quick desorption. The interaction between hydrogen and uncharged organic linkers is not this strong, and so a considerable amount of work has gone in synthesis of MOFs with exposed metal sites, to which hydrogen adsorbs with an enthalpy of 5-10kJ/mol. Synthetically, this may be achieved by using ligands whose geometries prevent the metal from being fully coordinated, by removing volatile metal-bound solvent molecules over the course of synthesis, and by post-synthetic impregnation with additional metal cations. (C5H5)V(CO)3(H2) and Mo(CO)5(H2) are great examples of increased binding energy due to <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> coordination sites; however, their high metal-hydrogen bond dissociation energies result in a tremendous release of heat upon loading with hydrogen, which is not favorable for fuel cells. MOFs, therefore, should avoid orbital interactions that lead to such strong metal-hydrogen bonds and employ simple charge-induced dipole interactions, as demonstrated in Mn32.|$|E

2500|$|The {{can opener}} is a device used to <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> cans. Most non-electrical can openers today use the hand-cranked rotary version {{consisting}} of a wheel with serrated edges in order to pierce and cut the top of tin cans. The first rotary can opener with a cutting wheel was invented in 1870 by William W. Lyman, of Meriden, Connecticut, who received a U.S. Patent 105,346 on July 12, 1870. In 1925 the Star Can Opener Company of San Francisco improved on Lyman's wheel blade by adding a second, serrated or toothed wheel, called a [...] "feed wheel" [...] or [...] "turning gear" [...] to ride below {{the rim of the}} can and rotate the can against the cutting wheel.|$|E

2500|$|CURV-III had a {{functional}} design capable of operations at [...] It had an <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> frame that was [...] by [...] by , weighed approximately , and was slightly buoyant in water. A cable and surface equipment enabled deployment {{and operation of}} the vehicle from a surface support ship. The CURV-III carried: wo Vidicon television cameras, four mercury-vapor headlights, two mercury-vapor spotlights, and a 35-millimeter camera with a 500 frame color film capacity and strobe light ... mounted on two independent pan-and-tilt units, each with 360 degrees of lateral and 180 degrees of vertical movement. The vehicle thus has full viewing and self-inspection capability.Other support systems included active and passive sonar, altimeter, depthometer, and compass. It had a tool assembly mounted on the bow that included a manipulator claw. Other tools and lifting devices could be mounted for particular tasks.|$|E
2500|$|The cavity {{magnetron}} is a high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves using {{the interaction of}} a stream of electrons with a magnetic field while moving past a series of <b>open</b> <b>metal</b> cavities (cavity resonators). Electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause radio waves to oscillate within, {{similar to the way}} a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening. The frequency of the microwaves produced, the resonant frequency, is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions. [...] Unlike other vacuum tubes such as a klystron or a traveling-wave tube (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier in order to increase the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an oscillator, generating a microwave signal from direct current electricity supplied to the vacuum tube.|$|E
