40|$|The {{abundant}} source <b>of</b> sea <b>fishing</b> needs law {{protection to}} protect their existence, so that was made a law product to arrange the application of sea exploitation application, in this was ruled in Regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about retribution <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license study at Lamongan residence. The study object was about the application <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business at Lamongan residence {{from the perspective of}} Regional Rule No. 7 / 2004 about retribution <b>of</b> <b>Fishing</b> <b>and</b> Sea Business license study and problems in license application and efforts to reveal the problems in retribution. The method used is by using socio-juridical method, which was the approach learned empirically the reciprocity relation between law and social phenomena. We used this method since the discussion object would be related with law in juridical way and studying several rule related with the application <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business from the perspective of section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business in Lamongan residence and also sociological research to find out the inhibition in facing odd factors from the license application in Lamongan Residence. According to the application <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license arranged in section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business, the <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license was held by the License Department of Lamongan residence. The application basically not only for the License Department but also involved <b>Fishing</b> Department <b>and</b> <b>Fishing</b> General Directorate <b>of</b> Brondong. The people role in <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea license business license was also the most important element in the process <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license. Basically, the inhibition in <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license came from two sides, they were the applicant side from the society and institution or bureaucracy which inhibited the license system. The retribution <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license generally aimed to increase the people life-standard, so that by the license, the law guarantee from the <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea entrepreneurs could be protected. The effort of regional government of Lamongan residence to increase the quality of public service in <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license could be seen from the effort of License department which was cooperated with <b>Fishing</b> <b>and</b> Sea Research Department. Besides, in order to increase the ability of License Department of Lamongan Residence worker, the License Department was also done training for the officer to do good service for the society. They should be responsive, good manner, and polite in doing service to the society. According the License Department, part of their job was function to make people satisfied. According to the discussion and the research result, so there could be concluded that the ineffective <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license application from the section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business in Lamongan Residence, because of the ineffectiveness of the rule was not caused by the substance of the rule, but the application in bureaucracy and society who applied the process <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>and</b> sea business license...|$|R
