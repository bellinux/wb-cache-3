The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. A <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave Very Best Of DVD featuring five of the greatest episodes was released on 22 October 2001 in Region 2. Then on 8 July 2004, a <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave Very Best Of was also released in Region 4. Each series was gradually released on DVD in Region 2 between 2004 and 2006, with a complete series 1-6 box set {{towards the end of}} 2006. A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave was a British BBC {{television}} dark comedy sitcom series {{written by}} David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For {{the next five}} years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Salmon {{agreed not}} to {{broadcast}} the episode at Christmas. It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000, forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which {{looked back at the}} hit sitcom. The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E

5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E

25|$|Pauline Newman died on April 8, 1986 at the New York City home of her adopted daughter, Elisabeth Burger. She was 98 {{years old}} at the time of her death. Newman’s death aroused grief and sadness among the ILGWU and women trade unionists. She had created a space for herself as a negotiator- {{standing}} with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male-dominated labor movement and <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cross-class world of women reformers. She influenced many people during her time. Her contributions as an organizer, a legislative expert, a writer, and a mentor to younger women activists were significant and wide-ranging.|$|E

The two-point conversion failed, so the Raiders were still down 34–9.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Johnson {{converted}} a small basement space into {{a recording}} studio, which he named Dub Narcotic Studio.

A third single, [...] "Gimme", appeared on September 17.|$|E
500|$|Second season writers took greater {{creative}} liberties with Real Adventures, invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes.

Falk explained that cool contrivances took precedence over accuracy, stating that [...] "Jonny Quest is a show with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fantastic, and one foot solidly based in reality."

500|$|... "Things Aren't Simple Any More" [...] is {{the final}} episode of the British {{television}} sitcom <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave. It was written by David Renwick and stars Richard Wilson as Victor Meldrew, Annette Crosbie as his wife Margaret, and features guest appearances by Hannah Gordon and Paul Merton. The episode depicts {{the death of the}} series' protagonist, Victor Meldrew, in a hit-and-run road accident, and his wife's efforts to deal with the driver who killed him. Renwick had been struggling to conceive and write new stories for the series and decided to kill off the character. The episode was filmed at Shawford, Hampshire, and at BBC Television Centre in London.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the first}} five series of <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave were {{produced}} and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being [...] "Love and Death," [...] which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby, and [...] "Starbound," [...] for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Belbin retired due to ill health afterwards, and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, {{as well as other}} shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.|$|E
500|$|During {{the recess}} of the {{impeachment}} court, the Republicans met in convention in Chicago and nominated Grant for president. [...] Stevens did not attend, and was {{dismayed by the}} exclusion of African-American suffrage from the party platform as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party. [...] When the Senate returned to session, it voted down ArticlesII andIII by the same 35–19 margin as before, and Chase declared the President acquitted. Stevens did not {{give up on the}} idea of removing Johnson; in July, he proffered several more impeachment articles (the House refused to adopt them). [...] He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts so as to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson. It was defeated; the Herald stated, [...] "It is lamentable to see this old man, with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grave, pursuing the President with such vindictiveness." [...] Nevertheless, Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{considered}} one of the best active shortstops in baseball during his career; he led NL shortstops with a [...]970 fielding percentage in 1931. However, he missed considerable playing time in his career due to injuries and illnesses. Jackson reinjured his knee in 1925, missed significant time {{as a result of his}} knee during the 1926 season, and had surgery for appendicitis during the 1927 season. He missed time with mumps in 1930 and influenza in 1932, and he continued to battle knee problems, missing much of the 1932 and 1933 seasons. Jackson was said to [...] "at 28, already [...] <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors". Despite this, manager Bill Terry said that Jackson would [...] "make or break" [...] the 1933 season. Though Jackson fell behind Blondy Ryan on the team's depth chart during the season, he returned in the 1933 World Series, which the Giants won over the Senators.|$|E

In 1991, Mantle played an irate husband whose wife is chatted up by Richie (Rik Mayall) in the first episode of Bottom, [...] "Smells", and also had a role as a police inspector in an episode of Drop the Dead Donkey. In 1991–92 he played Dave in Sandi Toksvig's The Pocket Dream at the Nottingham Playhouse and Albery Theatre in London.

500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of 'I {{want to be an}} actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E
