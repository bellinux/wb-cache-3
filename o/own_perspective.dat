In The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his <b>own</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rudiments of}} {{perspective}} arrived with Giotto (1266/7 – 1337), {{who attempted to}} draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects. Brunelleschi's <b>own</b> <b>perspective</b> paintings are lost, but Masaccio's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.|$|E
5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s <b>own</b> <b>perspective</b> may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E

500|$|Noel Gallagher {{summed up}} his <b>own</b> <b>perspective</b> on the album's {{aesthetic}} {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone in 1995; [...] "Whilst [...] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, What's the Story is about actually being a pop star in a band." [...] The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the rawness and edged rock of Definitely Maybe. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] and [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] was a significant departure from the band's debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, [...] "Whatever", released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on What's the Story. In the BBC documentary Seven Ages of Rock, former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that [...] "with Morning Glory, [...] began to take seriously the notion of being the voice of a generation".|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} investigated whether mind-sets and contexts that afford {{a focus on}} self-other differences can facilitate perceptual and conceptual forms of perspective taking. Supporting this hypothesis, results showed that directly priming a difference mind-set made perceivers more likely to spontaneously adopt other people’s visual perspectives (Experiment 1) {{and less likely to}} overimpute their own privileged knowledge to others (Experiments 2 and 3). Given that intergroup encounters typically evoke a difference mind-set, we also explored the possibility that such contexts might help perceivers to step outside their <b>own</b> <b>perspectives.</b> As predicted, perceivers were less “cursed” by their own privileged knowledge when mentalizing about out-group targets than when mentalizing about in-group targets (Experiment 4) and communicated more effectively with interaction partners whose minimal-group membership differed from their own (Experiment 5). Overall, acknowledging self-other differences allowed perceivers to look beyond the limits of their <b>own</b> <b>perspectives</b> and thereby provided an efficacious route to intuiting other people’s minds...|$|R

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 11 reviews. NME Lucy O'Brien commended Usher for producing a more mature album, that [...] "reflects his emotional experience" [...] writing [...] "Versatility {{is the key}} here: staccato beats with mellifluous melody, rich slow-jams and edgy harmonies – but woven through with Usher's <b>own</b> <b>perspective.</b> A winner." [...] BBC Online's Christian Hopwood also favoured the album, commenting on how Usher has developed [...] "his producing, singing and song writing skills to a new level" [...] noting his contribution to twelve of the seventeen tracks. Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music declared the album an improvement [...] "over Usher's [...] "old" [...] new album"—All About You—and depicted it as his best work to-date. Leroy credited the production groups The Neptunes and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, depicting {{that they have done}} [...] "some of their best work" [...] on the album. J. D. Considine of Blender commented that the album [...] "does what it's supposed to, giving Usher a grown-up R sound without reducing his boyish charm". Kathryn McGuire of Rolling Stone described Usher's vocals as [...] "velvety" [...] and further wrote that [...] "Amid all the playboy pouting and preening, Usher's vocals are impressively adaptable [...] McGuire noted the album's primary fault is that [...] "Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer", with every track being formulaic, or [...] "radio-safe".|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs {{the way it}} does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their <b>own</b> <b>perspective.</b> “ Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E

Under former President Lee Teng-hui, additional articles were appended to the ROC constitution in 1991 so that it applied effectively only to the Taiwan Area prior to national unification.

2500|$|Of humble origin, Ibn al-Qayyim's {{father was}} the {{principal}} (qayyim) of the School of Jawziyya, which {{also served as a}} court of law for the Hanbali judge of Damascus during the time period. Ibn al-Qayyim {{went on to become a}} prolific scholar, producing a rich corpus of [...] "doctrinal and literary" [...] works. As a result, numerous important Muslim scholars of the Mamluk period were among Ibn al-Qayyim's students or, at least, greatly influenced by him, including, amongst others, the Shafi historian Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), the Hanbali hadith scholar Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1397), and the Shafi polymath Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852/1449). In the present day, Ibn al-Qayyim's name has become a controversial one in certain quarters of the Islamic world due to his popularity amongst many adherents of the Sunni reform movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, who see in his criticisms of such widespread orthodox Sunni practices of the medieval period as the veneration of saints and the veneration of their graves and relics a classical precursor to their <b>own</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
