25|$|Most of Egypt's gods, {{including}} {{many of the}} major <b>ones,</b> <b>do</b> not have significant roles in mythic narratives, although their nature and relationships with other deities are often established in lists or bare statements without narration. For the gods who are deeply involved in narratives, mythic events are very important expressions of their roles in the cosmos.

25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable <b>ones</b> <b>do</b> not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them).

Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes the look on her face – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E
