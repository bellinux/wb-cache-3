5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{purchased}} a small holiday home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> at Obersalzberg. Renovations began in 1934 and were completed by 1936. A large wing was added onto the original house and several additional buildings were constructed. The entire area was fenced off, and remaining houses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> were {{purchased by the}} Nazi Party and demolished. Braun {{and the other members}} of the entourage were cut off from the outside world when in residence. Speer, Hermann Göring, and Martin Bormann had houses constructed inside the compound.|$|E
5|$|Three {{prominent}} ridges {{descend from}} {{the east side of}} the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is furthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The furthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several ski jumping competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with borax for a summer competition. Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope was built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> and the revived competitions continued until 1971.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{engineers}} {{working on}} the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of dolostone rocks in the region, which enabled the production of natural cement. The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian's Rondout formation. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was mined. Several quarries operated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had complete control of the entire mountain.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> summits.|$|E
5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog closed in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> top and {{severely}} reduced visibility there.

Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Snowflakes {{are also}} {{often used as}} symbols {{representing}} winter or cold conditions.

On the other side, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked Hill 401 where a North Korean force had penetrated in a gap between the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments. The fighting on Hill 401 was particularly severe. Both sides had troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> when night fell.|$|E
5|$|The first {{volcanic}} activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 {{years ago and}} formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and {{volcanic activity}} may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs {{are associated with the}} volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|The mountain's first {{recorded}} climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs, {{and a number}} of archeological sites, were found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> and at its feet. With an archeological site at the summit region, Llullaillaco is the highest archeological site in the world. There, in 1999, the mummified remains of three children, known as the Children of Llullaillaco, were found. They are presumed to have been human sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, {{is a common}} activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.|$|E

5|$|After peaking, Hary {{weakened}} due to land interaction, and {{it struck}} Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three {{deaths in the}} country, {{one of which was}} from electrocution. There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> peaks of the island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.|$|E
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E

60|$|In Africa, several forms {{characteristic}} of Europe, and some few {{representatives of the}} flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European species, believed {{not to have been}} introduced by man, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> several representative European forms are found which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. Dr. Hooker has also lately shown that several of <b>the</b> plants living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper parts of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring Cameroon <b>Mountains,</b> in <b>the</b> Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate Europe. It now also appears, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, that some of these same temperate plants have been discovered by the Rev. R.T. Lowe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of <b>the</b> Cape Verde Islands. This extension of the same temperate forms, almost under the equator, across the whole continent of Africa and to <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of <b>the</b> Cape Verde archipelago, {{is one of the most}} astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.|$|R
