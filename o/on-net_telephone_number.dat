40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the diversity of}} emergency code <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> currently in use in Australian hospitals and examined the feasibility of a standard emergency code <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> for all Australian hospitals, based on the United Kingdom experience. An email and telephone convenience survey of Australian hospitals from six states and two territories was conducted. Of the 108 hospitals surveyed, seven did not use a <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> system and used a button/ pager system to call an emergency. Of the 101 hospitals surveyed that used a <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> system, 40 different emergency <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> were in place, and in nine hospitals the <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> used for Code Blue (medical emergency) was different to the <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> used for other emergency codes. With increasing mobility of staff across hospitals, uniformity of emergency code <b>telephone</b> <b>numbers</b> is required to reduce confusion, potential danger and improve staff response in emergency situations. A single Australian standard emergency <b>telephone</b> <b>number</b> for all Australian hospitals is advocated. <br /...|$|R
