40|$|PURPOSE: Glucose {{degradation}} products (<b>GDPs)</b> are precursors <b>of</b> advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that cause cellular damage and inflammation. We examined the content <b>of</b> <b>GDPs</b> in commercially available glucose-containing infusion fluids and investigated whether GDPs {{are found in}} patients' blood. METHODS: The content <b>of</b> <b>GDPs</b> was examined in infusion fluids by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. To investigate whether GDPs also are found in patients, we included 11 patients who received glucose fluids (standard group) during and after their surgery and 11 control patients receiving buffered saline (control group). Blood samples were analyzed for GDP content and carboxymethyllysine (CML), {{as a measure of}} AGE formation. The influence of heat-sterilized fluids on cell viability and cell function upon infection was investigated. RESULTS: All investigated fluids contained high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>GDPs,</b> such as 3 -deoxyglucosone (3 -DG). Serum concentration of 3 -DG increased rapidly by a factor of eight in patients receiving standard therapy. Serum CML levels increased significantly and showed linear correlation with the amount of infused 3 -DG. There was no increase in serum 3 -DG or CML concentrations in the control group. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>GDPs</b> in most <b>of</b> the tested fluids damaged neutrophils, reducing their cytokine secretion, and inhibited microbial killing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that normal standard fluid therapy involves unwanted infusion <b>of</b> <b>GDPs.</b> Reduction <b>of</b> the content <b>of</b> <b>GDPs</b> in commonly used infusion fluids may improve cell function, and possibly also organ function, in intensive-care patients...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% <b>of</b> <b>GDP)</b> in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> at its peak.

This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the revisions of real seasonal adjusted <b>GDP,</b> <b>of</b> nominal unadjusted <b>GDP,</b> <b>of</b> the seasonal pattern, and <b>of</b> the <b>GDP</b> deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the revisions of the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the revisions of the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, revisions of real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that revisions of seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R
