2500|$|In 1980, {{after playing}} only seven games for Crispa, the Redmanizers {{released}} Adornado to the U/Tex Wranglers for {{the sum of}} 100,000 PhP. Teaming-up with Lim Eng Beng and reinforced by imports Aaron James and Glenn McDonald, led U/Tex to a memorable comeback win over the Toyota Tamaraws in the 1980 PBA <b>Open</b> <b>Conference</b> championship. The game was marked by U/Tex's [...] "miracle" [...] run as they wiped out a 4-point deficit with 16 seconds left in regulation and winning in overtime on a basket by Adornado with 1:25 remaining in the game. On Nov. 30, 1980, in a game between the Wranglers and the San Miguel Beermen, Adornado played perhaps the best game of his PBA career as he scored 64 points, grabbed 12 rebounds, handed out 3 assists and made 1 block shot in 40:42 minutes of playing time. The 64 points was the highest ever by a local player at that time, a record he shared with Danny Florencio. That same season, Adornado cracked the Mythical 5 {{for the third time}} in his PBA career, a classic case of retribution. In 1981, Adornado won his third MVP award while powering the Wranglers to a runner-up finish in the 1981 Reinforced Conference Finals against Crispa.
