There is a non-closure annulus heat {{source in the}} airtight space, and around the heat source, there are eight parallel heat resistance wire composed <b>omnibearing</b> level posture sense organ. Signal processing circuit is composed by pre-signal circuit and digital circuit, to obtain voltage, <b>omnibearing</b> signal synthesis and resolution compensation of <b>omnibearing</b> tile angle signal. It is testified that: resolution< 0. 1 °,the scope of azimuth is 360 °,the scope of tile angle is 20 °. The sensor is not only in small size but also in simply crafting. It is good in sensitive organ’s output consistency, and suitable for mass production. <b>Omnibearing</b> level posture sensor is required to output the exact signal about angle whenever the tested object is slant to any angle compared to horizon, also gives the rotation azimuth how slant axis is relative to the particular coordinate. It do has lots of meaning for the posture control of the shaking carriers such as ship and buoy, we can barely see the reports of the new sensor called <b>omnibearing</b> slant detection[1]. We used to use liquid and gas tilting Angle sensor in the <b>omnibearing</b> level posture. The former has small test range (no more than 2 °), long responding time(sometime...|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of sensor, Using ANSYS software, the three-dimensional finite element modelling method and simulation results of micromachined airflow <b>omnibearing</b> level posture sensor are presented. The results show that: (1) Using the sense organ’s symmetry characteristic, a half model is built first, which is convenient for modelling and observing the simulation results;(2) Gridding should be meshed more densely where fluid grads is large, which is helpful of saving simulation time and improving precision. Compared to two-dimensional modeling, the simulation results of three-dimensional modeling are more comprehensive and exact, which provides dependable basis for further research of the sensor...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} {{in this study}} is to probe to the aged welfare {{development}} in Taiwan, as well as the aged inequality ignored by present literatures and welfare policy makers. Accompanying to aging trend in Taiwan, aged welfare take more account of privilege role in social welfare, however, an <b>omnibearing</b> welfare service institution still cannot be reached, neither an universal allowance to ensure old-ages ’ economic protection. According to these disadvantages, present aged welfare schemes cannot deal with the inequality, rather making it worse if it still was ignored continually. Therefore, this study argues to notice inequality issue when developing aged welfare schemes, which both provide a comprehensive design in institutional aspect and universal social allowance in economic protection aspect.

FPSO assets management is an entire <b>omnibearing</b> process {{to make sure}} the business flow working well. The software FAMS: FPSO Assets Management System is a WEB 2. 0 application software which is developed based on JAVA technology. FPSO assets management system has unique industry characteristic, different parts can be integrated into one system. The integrity of these parts is useful for FPSO management to increase productivity and decrease cost and risk. FPSO assets management has three main parts which are input, core and output. The input part is the basis of the whole system. The input includes technology informtion, business information and others. The core part includes life cycle management, FPSO risk mangement, product operation management, maritime affairs management, equipment management, business contract management, financial affairs management, human resources management, information management and FPSO fleet management. The output part has most functions of the system, including information search, strategic decision support and management execution. FAMS will promote the assets management control, digitize assets information, monitor product operation process, supply strategic decision support and so on. In a word, FPSO Assets Management will be helpful for company to create their own competitive strength.

It has developed basing on absorbing the relative knowledge of computer delineation, computer visualization and computer image disposal. The knowledge of this branch is of much importance in computer application. Since it deals with contents with deeper meaning and it is more theoretic, having more arithmetic means, it generally stands for the level of computer application. The study and application of volume visualization is like a raging fire. My country started comparatively later in this field. This thesis gives systematic representation and discuss {{in the field of}} tomography image 3 D reconstruction. It mainly discusses after rotation, translation, filtering, interpolation and sharpening a series of 2 D CT scanning images, get the boundary data of different object to form 3 D volume data and actualize the 3 D reconstruction of the object, {{and at the same time}} implement the function of display, translation, rotation, scaling and projection the volume data. Basing on the implementation of these functions according to software programming, this thesis gives a sum up to each algorithm of 3 D volume visualization processing. The method to actualize the 3 D reconstruction of the tomography image is mainly about the image processing, image transformation, the way to actualize 3 D reconstruction and image compression, etc. In image processing, it talks about getting the anchor points in the tomography image, the geometrie transformation of the image, getting the boundary of the target, cross section display and the smoothing and sharpening of the image. In the transformation of the image, this thesis deals with the algorithm and implementation principle of the geometric transformation (transition, rotation, and scaling) of the 2 D image, the three-dimensionalization of the planar data, construction of the stereo mode, geometric transformation of the 3 D graph, curve-fitting, the processing of hidden line and hidden surface, color processing. It also introduces the thoughts of using OpenGL to develop and actualize tomography image 3 D reconstruction system, including using OpenGL to transform the coordinate, solid model building, to actualize 3 D rotation and projection. Recently, the methods of applying chemotherapy to deal with cancer in hospitals of our country are different. Hospital with great fund takes import software to design while most of the hospitals take domestic software. These kinds of software are designed by DAHENG Company in BeiJing, WEIDA Company in ShenZhen. The programs in the software these two hospitals' doctors use to treat are images fielding in the plane not making radiation design under the mode of <b>omnibearing</b> cubic display. Under this circumstance the judgment of the key part can not remain precise, and this part is the most important part that the doctors need. The above problem is the aim of this project. This thesis mainly deals with the subject that after calibrating and sharpening the series of 2 D CT images, extract the boundary data of different bodies to form a 3 D volume data and actualize 3 D reconstruction and at the same time actualize the function of display, translation, rotation, scaling and projection. Mostly basing on the application of medical area, this thesis aims at making further research on computer graphies, computer vision and computer image processing through the study and application of volume visualization in this field. By the study and development of the volume visualization technology in this project, it can provide simulation and display functions to the observer before the operation and the radiotherapy as well as providing the chance to simulate the real teaching and practicing link to the medical school in the teaching process, and increase the clinic level and teaching level of medical area. ______________________________________________________________________________ MOTS-CLÉS DE L’AUTEUR : volume visualization, volume data, tomography image, 3 D reconstruction, anchor point, boundary data, periphery boundary, OpenGL...|$|E
