5|$|Parker {{was acquitted}} <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> counts brought against him. Celestin, who shares a story credit on The Birth of a Nation, {{was convicted of}} sexual assault and {{received}} a six-month to one-year prison sentence in 2001, later raised to {{two to four years}} per state sentencing guidelines. Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges. Despite the accuser's willingness to testify at a second trial, prosecutors declined because other witnesses had scattered all over the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} over 24 days in Los Angeles, {{with a budget}} of $8 million. It was filmed by cinematographer Xavier Pérez Grobet, with whom Holofcener had previously worked on the HBO television series Enlightened. Although each scene was scripted, the actors would often ad-lib lines of dialogue. The final scene of the film, in which Eva and Albert reunite {{in front of his}} house, was improvised by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. It was edited by Robert Frazen, Holofcener's boyfriend at the time, who had also worked <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> of her previous films.|$|E
5|$|The second, smaller {{pavilion}} {{is known}} as the Tranofitaratra ("house of glass") and was constructed in 1862 under the orders of Ranavalona II. The queen would gather her ministers for counsel in this building, and the large windows <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> sides of the building provided a view of the countryside below, enabling the queen to ascertain the security of her surroundings. The glass used in the construction was imported by an Englishman named Parrett in 1862.|$|E

5|$|The {{wings of}} dragonflies are {{generally}} clear, {{apart from the}} dark veins and pterostigmata. In the chasers (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (Brachythemis) have brown bands <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> wings, while some scarlets (Crocothemis) and dropwings (Trithemis) have bright orange patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker (Aeshna grandis) have translucent, pale yellow wings.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|When the Bank Street {{ground was}} {{temporarily}} closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised {{enough money to}} pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.|$|E

5|$|After Nabi {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} depression on August29, the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian, Rota, Sapian, and Agrihan. On August30, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan, while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan. <b>On</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> islands, a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters. About 700people evacuated on Saipan, and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000travelers. As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August31, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, Felix Perez Camacho, also declared a condition of readiness 2, {{as well as a}} state of emergency. Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live {{performances}} on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 to modernize the projection systems <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>four</b> on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E

[...] The dogs are in an {{underground}} bunker, some of them standing and others <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours,</b> enduring the constant shelling.

They are called out of the trenches and crawl, <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours,</b> through a battlefield, with shells exploding around them. Arriving at an outpost, they see a machine gun bullet roll of sausages and are told by a commanding officer, [...] "men, we've discovered an improvement on barbed wire entanglement — we will lure the enemy into no man's land with these irresistible wieners — and our machine gunners will do the rest". When an enemy dachshund, wearing a uniform and metal coffeemaker filtering cup as a helmet. runs out of the trenches, <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours,</b> to eat the wieners, he is sprayed with machine gun fire, but jumps back into the trench unharmed. He later returns and grabs all the wieners which he brings to his side's trenches to share with his fellow soldiers who emit non-English-language sounds as they run <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>fours</b> to eat the treats.|$|R
