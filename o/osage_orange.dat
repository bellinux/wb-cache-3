5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, <b>Osage</b> <b>orange,</b> sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>Osage</b> <b>oranges</b> are {{commonly}} believed to repel insects, there is insufficient {{evidence to support}} this. Research has shown that compounds extracted from the fruit, when concentrated, may repel insects. However, the naturally occurring concentrations of these compounds in the fruit are far too low to make the fruit an effective insect repellent. In 2004, the EPA insisted that a website selling M. pomifera fruits online remove any mention of their supposed pesticidal properties as false advertisements.|$|R
25|$|The natural {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal for <b>Osage</b> <b>orange,</b> {{and the reason}} for its limited historical range despite its adaptability, {{has been the subject of}} debate. One hypothesis is that the <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> fruit was eaten by a giant ground sloth that became extinct shortly after the first human settlement of North America. Other extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon and gomphothere, may have fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal. An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant's original dispersal agent because modern horses and other livestock will sometimes eat the fruit. However, a 2015 study indicated that <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> seeds are not effectively spread by horses or elephant species.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many woods, <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> wood is very durable {{in contact}} with the ground. Smaller logs make good fence posts, being both strong and durable. They are {{generally}} set up green because the dried wood is too hard to reliably accept the staples used to attach the fencing to the posts. Palmer and Fowler's Fieldbook of Natural History 2nd edition, rates <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> wood as being at least twice as hard and strong as white oak (Quercus alba).|$|E
25|$|Maclura pomifera {{has been}} known {{by a variety of}} common names in {{addition}} to <b>Osage</b> <b>orange,</b> including hedge apple, horse apple, bois d'arc, bodark, bow-wood, yellow-wood and mock orange.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> tree {{is located}} at River Farm, in Alexandria, Virginia, and is {{believed}} to have been a gift from Thomas Jefferson. Another historic tree is located on the grounds of Fort Harrod, a Kentucky pioneer settlement in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Settlers experimented {{endlessly}} with substitute fencing materials. Some residents built stone fences; some constructed dirt ridges; others dug ditches. The {{most successful}} fencing material was the <b>osage</b> <b>orange</b> hedge until the 1870s when {{the invention of}} barbed wire provided farmers with satisfactory fencing material.|$|E
25|$|Osage orange's pre-Columbian {{range was}} largely {{restricted}} {{to a small}} area {{in what is now}} the United States, namely the Red River drainage of Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, as well as the Blackland Prairies and Post Oak Savannas. A disjunct population also occurred in the Chisos Mountains of Texas. It has since become widely naturalized in the United States and Ontario, Canada. <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> has been planted in all the 48 contiguous states of the United States and in southeastern Canada.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{take about}} 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a {{preference}} for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not monophagous since they can eat other species of Morus, {{as well as some}} other Moraceae, mostly <b>Osage</b> <b>orange.</b> They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt. After molting, the instar phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.|$|E
25|$|The heavy, {{close-grained}} yellow-orange wood is very {{dense and}} is prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> timber makes very good bows. In Arkansas, {{in the early}} 19th century, a good Osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, {{which can be used}} as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes. At present, florists use the fruits of M. pomifera for decorative purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Maclura pomifera, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Osage</b> <b>orange,</b> is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, typically growing to [...] tall. The distinctive fruit, from a multiple fruit family, is roughly spherical, bumpy, [...] in diameter, and turns a bright yellow-green in the fall.

Despite the name [...] "Osage orange", it is only very distantly related to the orange, and is instead a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae.|$|E
2500|$|The {{silkworm}} is the larva or caterpillar of {{the domestic}} silkmoth, Bombyx mori (Latin: [...] "silkworm of the mulberry tree"). It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of silk. A silkworm's preferred food is white mulberry leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even <b>osage</b> <b>orange.</b> Domestic silkmoths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, {{as a result of}} millennia of selective breeding. Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.|$|E
2500|$|Diospyros virginiana is {{believed}} to be an evolutionary remnant that was consumed by the [...] megafauna that roamed the North American continent until 10,000 years ago and would have eaten the fruit, assisting in its dispersal. However, as it is attractive to raccoons, rodents, and smaller animals, the loss of large grazing herbivores and omnivores in historical times has not seriously affected the tree's survival strategy as compared to Kentucky Coffeetree and <b>Osage</b> <b>Orange</b> which are inedible to most extant wildlife and saw their ranges greatly diminish without mastodons and other dispersal agent fauna. [...] A 2015 study supports the notion that elephants would have been a more effective disperser of the seeds than living North American mammals ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{account of}} the tree in the English language was given by William Dunbar, a Scottish explorer, in his narrative of a journey made in 1804 from St. Catherine's Landing on the Mississippi River to the Ouachita River. It was a curiosity when Meriwether Lewis sent some slips and cuttings to President Jefferson in March 1804. According to Lewis's letter, the samples were donated by [...] "Mr. Peter Choteau, who resided the greater portion of his time for many years with the Osage Nation." [...] Those cuttings did not survive, but later the thorny <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> tree was widely naturalized throughout the United States. [...] In 1810, Bradbury relates that he found two trees growing {{in the garden of}} Pierre Chouteau, one of the first settlers of St. Louis, apparently the same person.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> is {{commonly}} used as a tree row windbreak in prairie states, which gives it one of its colloquial names, [...] "hedge apple".

In 2001, its wood was used in the construction in Chestertown, Maryland of the Schooner Sultana, a replica of the HMS Sultana (1768).|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 1864, General Hood {{awoke to}} learn that Schofield's army had slipped by him during the night, and was now safely entrenched in Franklin, [...] to the north. Enraged at this {{unexpected}} development, Hood angrily blamed his subordinatesespecially Cleburnefor letting the Federals escape. Determined to stop Schofield from uniting with Thomas' main force at Nashville, Hood resolved to attack him head-on at Franklin, even though the Federals were now behind formidable fortifications (built for a previous battle fought there the year before) that included breastworks six to eight feet high fronted by four-foot wide ditches, and thorny obstructions using branches from <b>Osage</b> <b>Orange</b> trees in the area. Although Hood had roughly 39,000 men, only 27,000 would make the attack; this placed them at even odds with the Federals, who had {{the same number of}} men.|$|E
