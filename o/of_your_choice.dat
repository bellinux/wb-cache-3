This was particularly difficult, as not only had he to overcome the prejudices, he had to work especially hard since it was only people who owned land who could vote. Moreover, this was not a secret ballot. At that time the polling booth was a piece of paper with the names of the candidates shown. Beneath the name <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>choice</b> you had to sign your name for all to see.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the single campaign is {{a number of different}} battle scenarios, in which your pre-selected force will combat a number of enemy forces. Winning the scenario will award the player gold. Between battles the game switches to a map of the area, with the location of their army denoted by a figure of their champion. The player is then able to select his or her army and move to another location. This will bring up a force selection screen, and the player will then have to select a limited number of troops and heroes to play the next scenario with. Although the campaign is for the most part linear, there are also optional side quests, which although mostly unrelated to the main story will usually result in the heroes acquiring additional gold, troops or equipment {{that can be used in}} the campaign. As well as traditional large scale battles there are also Duel scenarios in which a hero character <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>choice</b> will enter straight into a duel with an enemy champion, with victory of either champion immediately ending the scenario.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{workload}} throughout 1974, {{particularly his}} dedication to setting up Dark Horse Records as the Beatles' Apple record label was being wound down, left him rushing {{to prepare for}} the tour by October while also completing Dark Horse. Another issue that compromised Harrison's enthusiasm for the concerts was the attention afforded them as the first US tour by a former Beatle, resulting in a clash between the artist's self-image and the expectations of many critics and concertgoers. Among the criticism levelled at him during the tour, Harrison's declarations of his Hindu-aligned religious beliefs came across as harangues rather than uplifting messages to his fans, and were symbolic of what NME critic Bob Woffinden later described as a [...] "didactic, sermonising mood" [...] on the singer's part. For the shows' encore, Harrison turned his biggest solo hit, [...] "My Sweet Lord", into an [...] "exhortation to chant God's name", author Alan Clayson writes, be it Krishna, Buddha, Christ or Allah. At times during Shankar's set, he chastised the audience for their lack of respect for Indian music and a God-conscious path. Early in the tour, Harrison also used religiosity to defend his decision to feature few Beatles-era songs in the setlist, telling Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "Gandhi says create and preserve the image <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>choice.</b> The image of my choice is not Beatle George ... My life belongs to the Lord Krishna ... I'm the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of Krishna." ...|$|E

According to Deci and Ryan’s Self Determination Theory (SDT; 2000, 2008; Ryan & Deci, 2002) {{individuals}} are motivated to engage in activities that will satisfy their basic psychological needs; relatedness (a feeling of connectedness and belonging with others), autonomy (feeling in control <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>choices</b> and experiencing the freedom of choice) and competence (belief about your ability in a certain setting). Basic needs satisfaction in turn, influences an athlete’s motivation (autonomous & controlled). Research has shown that an athlete’s motivation is associated with behavioural outcomes, including prosocial and antisocial variables (Hodge & Lonsdale, 2011; Ntoumanis & Standage, 2009). The purpose of this research project {{was to examine the}} team climate and the association it had with an athlete’s basic needs satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness).
