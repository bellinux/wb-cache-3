50|$|When {{an infant}} is born with an {{anorectal}} malformation, {{it is usually}} detected quickly {{as it is a}} very <b>obvious</b> <b>defect.</b> Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in Gentle Giant since 1990, with new fan clubs, new releases of live concerts and previously unreleased material, and several tribute albums. Sadly for fans, {{the rights of the}} band's catalogue are scattered among many companies, not all of which are keen on re-releasing the albums properly. In particular, the first four albums have yet to receive definitive CD releases. For example, the title track on Acquiring the Taste (1971) begins with an <b>obvious</b> <b>defect,</b> possibly from a damaged master tape, on all current CD and vinyl releases. The 1996 compilation Edge of Twilight includes a corrected version of the song. Conflicting evidence sometimes reports that this defect exists on the original 1971 vinyl release of the album, with the opening note bending up as the tape comes up to speed - probably an engineering error.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a nearly}} two-year legal battle, the Tampa Sports Authority {{came to a}} {{settlement}} with popular sports-seating and telescopic platform/bleacher company Hussey Seating of North Berwick, Maine. Following the stadium's opening in 1998, roughly 50,000 Hussey-manufactured seats at Raymond James Stadium began to fade from their original color - a bright, vibrant shade of red - to a shade of washed-out pink. Spotting this <b>obvious</b> <b>defect,</b> the Buccaneers organization pleaded to the TSA to sue the seating manufacturing company for the cost to replace the affected chairs in 2003. Initially, in May 2004, after testing samples of the seats, Hussey Seating {{did not find any}} cause for the fading, and thus, found no reason to replace the seats at the company's cost under the current 10-year warranty. After the TSA cited a portion of the warranty which did, in fact, state that Hussey would replace seats if any fading were to occur, Hussey president Tim Hussey admitted an error in the research and eventually would come to a $1.5 million agreement with the TSA to replace the problem seats. Reportedly, the seat-fading occurred due to a manufacturing error by Hussey, as a UV inhibitor - a sunscreen-like component for the plastic - was forgotten in the mixture used to create the seats. All of the problem seats were replaced by new, non-pink seats in the spring of 2006.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Members of the {{eukaryotic}} {{heat shock}} protein 70 family (Hsp 70 s) are regulated by protein cofactors that contain domains homologous to bacterial DnaJ. Of the three DnaJ homologues in the yeast rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER; Scj 1 p, Sec 63 p, and Jem 1 p), Scj 1 p is most closely related to DnaJ, hence it is a probable cofactor for Kar 2 p, the major Hsp 70 in the yeast RER.

40|$|Virus-induced interlukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and IL- 18 {{production}} in macrophages are mediated via caspase- 1 pathway. Multiple microbial components, including viral RNA, {{are thought to}} trigger assembly of the cryopyrin inflammasome resulting in caspase- 1 activation. Here, we demonstrated that NIrp 3 (-/-) and Casp 1 (-/-) mice were more susceptible than wildtype mice after infection with a pathogenic influenza A virus. This enhanced morbidity correlated with decreased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and reduced cytokine and chemokine production.

40|$|M A N Y {{features}} of the physiology of leukocytes are controversial. The origin of certain cells—for example, the monocyte and the plasma cell—is disputed. The functions {{of many of the}} cell species (e. g., the variously sized lymphocytes, the eosinophil, the basophil) are still conjectural, despite recent advances in cytochemistry. The lymphocyte has been implicated in such fundamental processes as immune globulin synthesis, antibody transport, 1 and the transmission of genetic material or information to proliferating tissues. 2 They have also been described as "pluripotential " cells, capable of differentiation into other hemic cells. 3 In contrast to these less well defined and esoteric functions of other cell types, the granulocyte is clearly designed primarily for phagocytosis.
