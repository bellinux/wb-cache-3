5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to many academics, both in Vietnam {{and in the}} West, {{the major}} factor which contributed to the rapid {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese defences in 1975 was the numerous and contradictory orders issued by President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. During the various phases of the South Vietnamese retreat from the northern provinces, namely in I and II Corps Tactical Zones, Thiệu had at least three different plans and decisions laid <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> and all lacked consistency or simply contradicted one another. For example, on March 13, Thiệu ordered General Ngô Quang Trưởng to abandon I Corps, and return the elite Airborne Division to the Mekong Delta region of III Corps. Soon afterwards, similar orders were issued to Major-General Phạm Văn Phú to evacuate from the Central Highlands. On March 17, with intervention from General Cao Văn Viên, Thiệu contradicted his previous orders when he approved Trưởng's defensive plan to hold the major cities of Huế and Da Nang.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, Chris Gardner married Sherry Dyson, a Virginia {{native and}} an {{educational}} expert in mathematics. With his knowledge, experience and contacts within the medical field, it appeared Gardner had his medical career plans laid <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> However, with {{ten years of}} medical training ahead of him and with changes in health care just on the horizon, {{he realized that the}} medical profession would be vastly different by the time he could practice medicine. Gardner was advised to consider more lucrative career options; a few days before his 26th birthday, he informed his wife, Sherry, of his plans to abandon his dreams of becoming a physician.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the banks}} of the Jordan River, in sight of the land, Moses {{assembled}} the tribes. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a song of praise and pronounced a blessing on the people, and passed his authority to Joshua, under whom they would possess the land. [...] Moses then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty. More humble than any other man (Num. 12:3), [...] "there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom YHWH knew face to face" [...] (Deuteronomy 34:10). The New Testament states that after Moses' death, Michael the Archangel and the Devil disputed over his body (Epistle of Jude 1:9).|$|E

60|$|Presently two warriors entered. The leader {{exhibited}} a unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the darkness. He advanced slowly, kicking <b>out</b> viciously <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> Finally he kicked {{me in the}} face. Then he knew where I was.|$|R

60|$|As {{soon as the}} man entered Dorian {{pulled his}} chequebook out of a drawer, and spread it <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Helena {{stood still}} to {{consider}} the road. He held <b>out</b> his hand <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> It was motionless as a dead flower on this silent night.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Much farther! Yer {{as good as}} there,' {{said the}} long-legged tramper, {{pointing}} <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> 'Look there! Those are the lights of London.' ...|$|E
60|$|The throng {{carried her}} <b>out</b> just <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> He could nearly touch her. She {{did not know}} he was there. He saw the brown, humble {{nape of her neck}} under its black curls. He would leave himself to her. She was better and bigger than he. He would depend on her.|$|R
60|$|He walked {{deliberately}} {{away from}} the busy part of the town, turning {{his back on the}} river, stepping <b>out</b> briskly straight <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> and swinging his gold-beaded cane as he walked.|$|R
60|$|They soon {{passed out}} of the village, and then {{travelled}} along a very pleasant road, which skirted {{the foot of the}} mountain range,--all the time gradually ascending.

6000|$|... "By no means, Sir Marmaduke," [...] said Stanbury, {{throwing}} <b>out</b> {{his hand}} <b>before</b> <b>him</b> {{so as to}} give the energy of action to his words. [...] "He has the higher rank. I will admit that." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{would not}} hear <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> but passed <b>before</b> <b>him</b> towards the {{well-known}} apartment. A young lady {{came out of}} the room a little disturbed, as it seemed, and said, [...] "John, what is the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have dined. I {{should like}} some tea, please," [...] said Lydgate, curtly, still scowling and looking {{markedly}} at his legs stretched <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
