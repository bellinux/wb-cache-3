500|$|With the 2010 Winter Olympics {{occurring}} in Vancouver, the writers wanted an Olympics-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script {{was written by}} Rob LaZebnik—his fourth writing credit—, who originally considered having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he decided a curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge and explore the issues of spouses competing together. The writers used some artistic license, because although curling is an Olympic sport, mixed-doubles, which is featured in the episode, is not an Olympic event. However, in the episode, it is explained that the event is being held as a demonstration sport. Curling had previously been shown in the season 13 episode [...] "The Bart Wants What It Wants", when the family visits Toronto. In {{order to try to}} make the depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and tried the sport themselves. They also consulted with four-time American mixed curling champions Brady and Cristin Clark, as well as Rick Patzke, the chief <b>operating</b> <b>officer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Curling Association, who felt that the writers took a [...] "genuine interest" [...] in the sport.|$|E
