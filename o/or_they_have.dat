25|$|Regarding {{the giving}} of praise by teachers, praise is a {{reinforcer}} for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development {{such that they}} seek rapport with peers. Thus, teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures. They give no value to praise provided by adults, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no respect for the individual who is giving praise.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in Buenos Aires, {{secondary}} education consists of 5 years, called from 1st year to 5th year, {{as opposed to}} primary education's 1st to 7th grade. Most schools don't require students to choose their orientation, as they study the basic such as maths, biology, art, history and technology, but there are schools that do, whether they are orientated to a certain profession <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> orientations to choose from when they reach a specific year.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} a lack of good quality {{research}} on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Gear {{availability}} is {{a problem}} that plagues kayakers. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} of Chinese {{characters}} from past to present remains unknowable because new ones are being developed all the time – for instance, brands may create new characters when none of the existing ones allow for the intended meaning – <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been invented by whoever wrote them and have never been adopted as official characters. Chinese characters are theoretically an open set and anyone can create new characters, though such inventions are rarely included in official character sets. The number of entries in major Chinese dictionaries is the best means of estimating the historical growth of character inventory.|$|E

25|$|As of 2012, {{only five}} plastic {{materials}} {{continued to be}} widely used in the capacitor industry as films for capacitors: PET, PEN, PP, PPS and PTFE. Other plastic materials {{are no longer in}} common use, either because they are no longer manufactured, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been replaced with better materials. Even the long-time manufactured polystyrene (PS) and polycarbonate (PC) film capacitors have been largely replaced by the previously-mentioned film types, though at least one PC capacitor manufacturer retains the ability to make its own films from raw polycarbonate feedstock. The less-common plastic films are described briefly here, since they are still encountered in older designs, and are still available from some suppliers.|$|E
25|$|If a goalkeeper {{is injured}} or sent off, a {{substitute}} goalkeeper {{has to take}} their place, otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper's place in goal. In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper (thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players). They then play {{the remainder of the}} match with nine outfield players. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player has to take the dismissed goalkeeper's place and wear the goalkeeper shirt.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) usually advises the media as to when this will happen in cases that may be of interest; other large departments do not, so photographers and camera crews wait at the central location in hopes of getting a perp-walk image. In 2011, some New York camera crews and photographers waited 15 hours for former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn to be brought by for his arraignment on charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} {{the rates}} from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively {{lower than the}} rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oil—that is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but {{the net result is}} that from Maine to California the general arrangement of open rates on petroleum oil is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors.|$|E

Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people.

[...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E
