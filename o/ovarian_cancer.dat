5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> while her grandmother died from <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E

40|$|MRI for discriminatingmetastatic ovarian tumors fromprimary {{epithelial}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> Yanhong Xu†, Jia Yang†, Zaixian Zhang and Guixiang Zhang* Aims: To find specific {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) features to differentiate metastatic ovarian tumors from primary epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods: Eleven cases with metastatic ovarian tumors and 26 cases with primary malignant epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> were retrospectively studied. All features such as patient characteristics, MRI findings and biomarkers were evaluated. The differences including laterality, configuration, uniformity of locules, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) signal of solid components and enhancement of solid portions between metastatic ovarian tumors and primary epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> were compared by Fisher’s exact test. Median age of patients, the maximum diameter of lesions and biomarkers were compared by the Mann-Whitney test. Results: Patients with metastatic ovarian tumors were younger than patients with primary epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> in the median age (P = 0. 015). Patients with bilateral tumors in metastatic ovarian tumors were more than those of primary epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> (P = 0. 032). The maximum diameter of lesions in metastati...|$|R

2500|$|Sulfatide {{levels in}} these cancer lines and tissues may vary. For example, {{the levels of}} {{sulfatide}} are much lower in undifferentiated small cell carcinoma tissues and primary lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues in humans than in primary lung adenocarcinoma tissue in humans. [...] In human <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers,</b> sulfatide levels are much higher in malignant <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> than in benign <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers.</b> Other cancers such as Wilms’ tumor show no expression of sulfatide. Therefore, it appears that such increased levels of sulfatide are not universal in every form of cancer, and more experimentation {{must be done to}} confirm that elevated levels of sulfatide are not just artifacts of cultured cancer cell lines.|$|R

5|$|Women {{may have}} acute {{low back pain}} from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer,</b> {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer.</b> Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{reproductive}} hormone inhibin {{has been}} used as a diagnostic marker of ovarian mucinous and granulosa cell cancers. The aims of this study were to develop a new inhibin immunofluorometric assay (�C IFMA) to replace an inhibin RIA as a diagnostic marker of these <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> and to assess whether the �C IFMA in combination with CA 125, which detects serous cancers, leads to an improved biochemical diagnosis of all <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods: Serum inhibin concentrations were determined in healthy postmenopausal women (n � 165) and women with <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> (n � 154), using an inhibin RIA and an �C IFMA, which detects inhibin forms containing the �C subunit as well as the free �C subunit. Results: The �C IFMA gave a similar or better discrimination of mucinous (90 % vs 71 %) and granulosa cell (100 % vs 100 %) cancers compared with the inhibin RIA. Combination of CA 125 and �C IFMA values by canonical variate analysis or by multiROC analysis showed that the percentage of all <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers</b> detected was significantly increased compared with either CA 125 or �C IFMA alone. Conclusions: The �C IFMA shows a similar or better specificity compared with the RIA, but with increased sensitivity. In combination with CA 125, the �C IFMA provides an effective dual test for the detection of the majority (90 %) of <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Type II endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in black women, and are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia.

They can appear to be epithelial <b>ovarian</b> <b>cancer</b> on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with {{a greater risk of}} relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E
