40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the influence of combined nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) fertility on the <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compound</b> content of garlic bulbs, especially alliin, as a specific flavour quality trait related to the health-value of garlic. Three cultivars, 'Printanor', 'Morasol' and 'Messidr 6 me', were grown in the greenhouse and in vitro. Sulphur was increased in the macronutrients within the range 0 - 144 mg l(- 1). Numerous combinations of both S and N were tested in vitro. In the greenhouse, increasing N levels, from 184. 8 mg l(- 1) to 856. 8 mg l(- 1), were tested with a single high level of S (128 mg l(- 1)). Increasing S alone {{did not affect the}} growth or bulb weight of any garlic cultivar, but slightly increased the alliin content of bulbs. No symptoms of S deficiency were observed under greenhouse conditions, although the same garlic cultivars grown in vitro at 0 mg S l(- 1) clearly suffered, their size being greatly reduced. This suggests an important role for S contamination, such as atmospheric S, in the process of S absorption by garlic plants, which is discussed. Increasing N levels significantly accelerated garlic maturity and decreased bulb yield. The effect of N on the <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compound</b> content of bulbs was cultivar-dependent, but alliin accumulation was not enhanced. 'Printanor' and 'Morasol' had the highest alliin levels and were negatively influenced by increasing N, while a slight synergistic effect of S and N was observed on 'Messidrome'. 'Messidrome' also had the highest flavour potential when including precursors, and was more efficient in accumulating S into organosulphur compounds. It is therefore advisable to choose the most appropriate variety, and to adapt the N x S fertilisation regime according to the environment, in order to produce garlic with the highest health-value. ...|$|E

In this study, α-lipoic acid was incorporated into chitosan microparticles obtained by reverse emulsion crosslinking technique, as well as into microparticles of alginate/gelatin crosslinked with zinc ions. Encapsulation of α-lipoic acid in both cases {{was carried out by}} swelling of synthesized dried microparticles by their dipping in a solution of the active substance under strictly controlled conditions. Encapsulation efficiency of α-lipoic acid obtained in this study was up to 53. 9 %. The structural interaction of α-lipoic acid with the carriers was revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In vitro released studies showed that controlled release of α-lipoic acid was achieved through its encapsulation into chitosan microparticles. The results of in vitro antioxidative activity assays of released α-lipoic acid indicated that antioxidant activity was preserved at a satisfactory level. These obtained results suggested that chitosan microparticles could be suitable for modeling the controlled release of α-lipoic acid. [Projekat Ministartsva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|As well as {{studying}} coal {{samples from}} Oklahoma and Missouri States, {{we have now}} completed the preliminary part of a study of a well known high organosulphur containing coal, Illinois No. 6. As {{a number of other}} research groups have used Illinois No. 6 for study, we thought it wise to also analyse this coal for comparison of our method with existing data reported in the literature. To date, analyses of the aliphatic fractions of the free maltene components and the aliphatic hydrocarbons isolated following desulphurization of the free maltene polar fraction, asphaltenes and pre-extracted coal matrix have been performed in duplicate. So far, most of these samples have been analysed by GC and subsequently quantified using n-C{sub 24 }D{sub 50 }. As Figures 1 and 2 show, the duplicates for the desulphurized products (e. g. Figure 2 a and 2 b of desulphurized asphaltenes) while showing broad similarities, {{do not appear to be}} identical. This is emphasized by differences in the yields of n-alkanes generated, quantified in Table 1. Abundance of corresponding n-alkanes are often quite variable for duplicate analyses, which have been normalized to the quantity of original starting material. While inhomogeneity of sampling can easily explain the variation in abundance of products generated for the asphaltenes and coal matrix, the same cannot be said for the free polar compounds, which dissolve easily in the methanol/tetrahydrofuran solvent system used in the desulphurization process. It would therefore appear that desulphurization experiments should be performed at the very least, in duplicate to gain a clear impression of the distribution and abundance of aliphatic products cleaved from organosulphur compounds.

40|$|D. Tech. Chemical, Metallurgical and Materials EngineeringCorrosion is the {{chemical}} or electrochemical interaction between a material, especially metals, and their environment resulting in mild to severe {{deterioration of the}} material and its properties. The economic impact and problems resulting from corrosion has drawn strong attention from scientists and engineers worldwide. Stainless steel {{is the most important}} engineering metal worldwide, and industrially stainless steel is used extensively due to its resistance to corrosion e. g. in acid pickling, industrial acid cleaning, acid descaling, oil well acidizing and the petroleum industry. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels is due to the formation of a protective film which covers the steel surface instantaneously when exposed to mild operational conditions in the presence of oxygen; however, the oxide is most often porous and insufficient to protect the steel from further oxidation and corrosion attack in harsh environments. It is hypothesized that: In-depth understanding of the electrochemical behaviour of ferrous alloys in interaction with selected organic compounds in acidic environments will enhance inhibitor application for corrosion control; Failure and poor performance of most inhibitor admixtures can be eliminated with comprehensive knowledge of electrochemical interaction at the metal-inhibitor interface, passive film formation, duration and breakdown, adsorption characteristics, bond formation and molecular structure effect; Optimization of the current electroanalytical method will enhance effective pitting corrosion detection, analysis and control with the use of organic inhibiting compounds.

40|$|The liquid-phase {{adsorption}} of thiophene from thiophene/iso-octane solutions {{has been}} investigated in batch conditions at room temperature and atmospheric pressure on MCM- 22 zeolites with Si/Al in the 9 – 46 range. Thiophene adsorption was found to occur in two steps whatever the Si/Al ratio of the adsorbent. The presence of ferrierite besides the MCM- 22 phase caused a significant loss of the adsorption performance. For pure MCM- 22 samples, the Si/Al ratio influenced the adsorption performance. Based on the acid properties of the samples, investigated by adsorption microcalorimetry of ammonia, the adsorption features were interpreted by assuming that positively charged species were originated during the first step; these species underwent successive reaction with weakly adsorbed species formed in the second step, leading to heavy molecular weight <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> Direct evidence for the occurrence of reactive adsorption of thiophene involving its transformation into heavy molecular weight <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> was obtained by GC/MS investigation {{of the nature of}} the adsorbed material recovered after the adsorption experiments.

The second objective was to study sulphur 1 s NEXAFS spectra of <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> relevant to petroleum by experimental and computational methods. Towards the first objective, Total Electron Yield (TEY) detection has been implemented in a STXM microscope, by conventional sample current and single electron counting detection modes. This provides improved surface-sensitive detection, simultaneous with existing bulk-sensitive transmission detection in the STXM microscopes. Both approaches provide improved surface sensitive imaging and spectroscopy, although channeltron-based detection is superior. TEY-STXM provides surface sensitive imaging of ultrathin films such as phase-separated Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer films, phase separated polymer thin films, as well as differentiation of surface and bulk oxides of patterned metal thin films. The challenge for TEY-STXM measurements is the poor vacuum environment in the STXM chamber at the CLS, which greatly impacts {{the function of the}} channeltron as well as the rate of the photodeposition. Although the effect of photodeposition can be minimal in bulk spectroscopy of organic samples, it is a challenge in spectroscopy of organic thin films, where the photodeposits can dominate the weak signal originating from the surface. Chapter 4 of this thesis discusses the details of this study along with the challenges encountered in the development of this new TEY-STXM technique. The second goal of my research was the detailed study of sulphur 1 s NEXAFS spectra of <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> by experimental and computational methods to obtain a complete database of sulphur 1 s NEXAFS spectra. The speciation and quantification of sulphur compounds is of great interest in different areas such as fossil fuel studies, biology, geology, and archaeology.

40|$|Crystal {{structure}} prediction (CSP) {{has been}} a problem of great industrial interest but also a fundamental challenge in condensed matter science. The problem involves the identification of the stable and metastable crystals of a given compound at certain temperature and pressure conditions. Computational CSP methods based on the lattice energy minimization have been successful in identifying experimentally observed crystals of an organic compound as local minima of the lattice energy landscape but not always with the correct relative stability. This is primarily controlled by the lattice energy model. The lattice energy model adopted in this work {{is based on the assumption}} that molecules are rigid, electrostatic interactions are modelled via distributed multipoles derived from the ab initio charge density of the gas phase conformation and an empirical pairwise exp- 6 potential for the repulsion dispersion interactions. Based on the fact that the reliability of all computational models is based on their agreement with experimental evidence, the use of available experimental data for improving the lattice energy model is the main focus of this work. First the impact of different modelling choices [...] choice of level of theory for electrostatics and parameters for the repulsion-dispersion term [...] in the modelling of experimental structures, energies and relative stabilities is investigated. Results suggest that a reestimation of the repulsion-dispersion parameters is expected to produce parameters consistent with changes in the other lattice energy terms and bring the model closer to experiment, consequently improving predictions. An algorithm, CrystalEstimator, for fitting the exp- 6 potential parameters by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between experimental structures and energies and the corresponding relaxed structures and energies is developed. The lattice energy of the experimental structures is minimized by the program DMACRYS. The solution algorithm is based on the search of the parameter space using deterministic low discrepancy sequences; and the use of an efficient local minimization algorithm. The proposed method is applied to derive transferable exp- 6 potential parameters for hydrocarbons, <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> azahydrocarbons, oxohydrocarbons and <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> containing nitrogen. Three different sets of parameters are developed, suitable for use in conjunction with three different models of electrostatics derived at the HF/ 6 - 31 G(d,p), M 06 / 6 - 31 G(d,p) and MP 2 / 6 - 31 g(d,p) levels.

AGE significantly reduced Cd-induced TBARS production and LDH leakage in the two cell lines, and AGE and DADS both increased GSH levels in Cd-treated cell lines. Pre-treatment of cells with AGE or DADS increased expression of the protective enzyme NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO 1), and this was associated with the accumulation of the transcription factor Nrf 2. These results show that AGE and DADS have beneficial effects against Cd-induced toxicity, and this protection appears to be mediated via induction of cytoprotective enzymes in an Nrf 2 -dependent manner. This indicates the potential for using AGE as a chemoprevention strategy for Cd toxicity...|$|R

In the Arckaringa Basin, {{organic carbon}} (OC) {{enrichment}} within the Permo-Carboniferous Stuart Range Formation occurred within syn-sedimentary fault troughs that were scoured by glaciers. This enrichment was facilitated by sytematic variations in water chemistry within these troughs identifying periods of restriction and open water exchange with {{the ocean to}} the south. The U-shaped morphology {{of some of these}} troughs apparent in seismic profiles along with the presence of lonestones, dropstones, and feldspathic, angular sediment identifies a cold palaeoclimate depositional setting that is unusual for the organic enrichments of up to 12 % total organic carbon (TOC). It is hypothesised that episodic restriction within these fjord-like troughs led to cyclical variations in sulphur concentration within the water column, driving sulfurization reactions that preserved organic matter in discreet laminae. Abundant pyrite (up to 20 wt%) and the distribution of <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with TOC supports this hypothesis. Cyclical oxygenation of bottom waters and alkalinity from OM mineralisation by bacterial sulphate reducers resulted in the formation of manganese carbonate (kutnohorite) during periods of ventilation. Organic-lean sediments in the adjacent lacustrine Cooper Basin that lacked a source of marine sulphur do not show vulcanization nor preservation of labile organic matter.

40|$|Volatile <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOSC) are {{a diverse}} group of {{chemical}} entities, which are among the highest impact aroma chemicals (HIACs) in the flavour and fragrance (F&F) industry. These compounds may be synthesized by both chemical processes, or through the use of biological pathways referred to 'natural production' methods. The overall aim of this investigation was to establish methods for the enzymatic production of the VOSCs methanethiol, hydrogen sulphide, thiomenthone and other valuable F&F compounds from natural precursors. The first part of this project was focussed on identifying novel bacterial and plant C-S lyase enzymes, which can cleave the bond between sulphur and carbon in methionine, cysteine and related conjugates synthesised through Michael addition reaction. Methods for the optimal production of recombinant C-S lyases were developed using E. coli as a bacterial host. The collection of C-S lyases selected were cloned and then used for in vitro natural production studies. A comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling their effective use in biotransformation studies included the dependence and optimisation of cofactor, temperature and pH in order to choose the most appropriate enzymes for the production of each VOSC. In addition, methods for the enzymatic methylation of VOSC and other free thiols were developed using an S-methyl transferase derived from Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, building on these single-step reactions, the concept of linked enzymatic reactions in vivo and in vitro to generate S-methylated VOSCs directly from amino acid derivatives was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} single-source coke types (SSA, SSB and SSC) {{were studied}} for their air and CO 2 reactivities using the Hydro method and the observed correlation with reactivity determinant parameter such as elemental composition was noted. The reaction temperatures were 525 oC and 960 oC for air and CO 2 reactivities, respectively. Coke sample SSA recorded the highest CO 2 reactivity value of 166 mg/g h while coke sample SSB recorded the lowest value of 25 mg/g h. The coke CO 2 reactivity showed a moderately strong correlation with the combined effect of Na, Fe and Ca concentrations. The inhibitory effect of sulphur as a catalytic poison on Na was observed with significant downward trend in CO 2 reactivity of the investigated cokes. Coke air reactivities showed the expected strong correlation with V. Air reactivity was highest in sample SSC (262 mg/g h) at V concentration of 378 ppm and lowest in sample SSB (39. 6 mg/g h) at V concentration of 68 ppm. Sample SSA recorded reactivity value of 129. 6 mg/g h at V concentration of 147 ppm. The compound 1 -butanethiol was identified by 1 -D 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR, and by 2 -D COSY, HSQC and HMBC NMR spectroscopic techniques.

The study investigated the addition of mixtures of garlic and ginger to diets of pullet chicks, growers and laying hens to evaluate beneficial effects on growth and egg production as well as their possible effects on lipid content of serum and yolk. Five diets were used for the study. Control diet was not supplemented with any of the mixtures. Four increasing levels of garlic (0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 %) were incorporated into diets for pullet chicks, growers and laying hens. Ginger supplements were also added to the diets at 0. 5 % and 0. 75 %. The results showed that the mixtures of garlic and ginger were beneficial by promoting final live weight of pullet growers, laying hens and also by lowering total cholesterol, triacylglycerol concentration in serum and yolk. Furthermore, the mixtures of garlic and ginger significantly (p< 0. 001) improved hen day production, egg weight and feed conversion. However, dietary inclusion of the mixtures significantly reduced shell weight and thickness. Significant (p< 0. 001) negative linear relationships were observed between dietary mixtures of garlic and ginger with parameters of serum and yolk lipids. In conclusion, the mixtures of garlic and ginger improved egg weight with lower cholesterol and triacylglycerol as well as better hen day production of laying hens.

Consumption of onions has been also inversely correlated to coronary heart disease mortality in man (2). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential health benefits of brown onions fed at two levels of intake, using the pig as a human model. Fifteen female and fifteen male crossbred (Large White x Landrace) pigs (initial weight 24. 4 ± 0. 85 kg) were selected and pre-fed with a wheat-based control diet containing 25 % (w/w) of total fat for three weeks. At the end of the three weeks period the pigs (39. 9 ± 0. 97 kg) were randomly allocated to one of the three dietary treatments and were maintained in individual pens throughout the study. The treatments consisted of brown onions fed at 16 or 40 g/kg body weight (BW) 0. 75 and no onion. Onions were homogenised in a blender prior to being mixed with dry feed formulated to contain 19. 5 MJ DE/kg, 8 % (w/w) of canola oil and 15 % (w/w) of tallow to simulate the saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio of a western human diet. Pigs were fed approximately 80 % of ad libitum for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture three hours post-feeding at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6.

40|$|Volatile <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOSCs) are key {{ingredients}} in the aroma of tropical fruit where they are active as both free thiols and the respective thioesters. Present as trace high-impact flavourings, VOSCs are however problematic to extract and have therefore become targets for bioproduction. This work focuses on the endogenous thioesterases in tropical fruit believed to catalyze the liberation of thiol VOSCs from thioester precursors. Using a simple and sensitive colourimetric assay, a thioesterase activity toward VOSCs was identified in purple passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The enzyme {{was identified as a}} cell wall-bound protein in the mesocarp of the fruit. Following extraction with salt solutions, the thioesterase was purified 150 -fold and shown to be associated with a 43 kDa polypeptide. Affinity labelling with a biotinylated fluorophosphonate suicide probe showed the enzyme to be a serine hydrolase, with MS-MS sequencing of tryptic digests identifying it as a pectin acetylesterase (PAE). Putative thioesterase PAEs were subsequently cloned from passion fruit and Arabidopsis thaliana. The observation that an esterase involved in cell wall modification had a secondary role in hydrolysing esterified VOSCs led to the consideration of further fruit species as a source of the enzyme. Orange (Citrus sinensis) was particularly abundant in thioesterase activity. The enzyme was purified 85 -fold and identified as a homologous 43 kDa basic (pi: 9) PAE. The enzyme was stable (t(_ 1 / 2) : 7 days 22 hours) and demonstrated a high turnover toward VOSCs (k(_cat) : 7. 85 sec(^- 1)). Freeze-dried orange peel was found to retain activity (> 90 % activity, 3 months 4 C) and demonstrated comparable productivities to those of immobilized microbial enzymes. Here we have initiated a programme for developing processes for the bioproduction of VOSCs, in which the potential of plant glycohydrolases has been demonstrated.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The controls on organic carbon preservation in sediments are poorly understood, however {{there is a}} first order association between high total organic carbon concentration (TOC), warm climates and fine grained sediments with mature mineralogy in the geologic record. Permo-Carboniferous marine sediments in the Arckaringa Basin, however, present an exception with anomalous organic carbon concentration (< 11 % TOC) occurring within mineralogically immature siltstones deposited in deep, narrow (marine) fjords during glacial conditions. Organic matter (OM) is not refractory terrigenous material, but rather hydrogen-rich and labile, thus identifying an active preservational mechanism that differs from conventional organic carbon enrichment controlled by mineral preservation effects. Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) reveal an association between labile OM and high sulphur concentrations, and EDS mineral mapping identifies a cyclic millimetre alteration between sulphur/OM rich laminae and manganese carbonate (kutnohorite) laminae, identifying oscillating benthic redox conditions similar to annual varves in proglacial environments. Framboidal pyrite (< 5 µm) is abundant only within organic-rich laminae, indicating sulphate reduction in euxinic conditions resulting from restricted sea water exchange {{and the development of}} strong density stratification. Seisimic profiles indicate that deposition occurred in fjord-shaped troughs, with restriction resulting from end moraines acting as sills to the open ocean. Thus, organic carbon enrichment is attributed to restriction in the ancient fjords, leading to periods of hydrogen sulphide build up within the water column that were annually flushed with seasonal change in temperature and runoff. The reducing conditions of the fjord provided a chemical trap for S leading to its enrichment in organic matter. Similarly, Mn within carbonates was enriched in the same manner. Excess dissolved sulphur build up in the water column and sediments resulted in vulcanization (sulfurization) reactions polymerizing labile organic compounds (lipids and carbohydrates) and their preservation as <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> during early diagenesis.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{reactions}} of two high-valent metal complexes. [UO 2] 2 + and [W(CN) 8] 3 - in their excited states in which their one-electron reduction potentials are increased greatly, i. e. sufficiently for them to remove an electron from water. The studies with uranyl ion cover the following, (i) the ground state interaction with some simple amino acids, (ii) the excited-state interaction {{with a variety of}} amino acids including some containing sulphur, which gave results of particular interest and, in following up the latter, (iii) the excited state interaction with some simple <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> These three inter-related topics form Chapters 8, 9 and 10 of this thesis. In more detail, in Chapter 8 we characterise optically, three new complexes of 1 : 4 stoichiometry between [UO 2] 2 + and glycine and α- and β-alanine in acidic aqueous solution. The x-ray crystal structure of the glycine complex confirms it as tetrakis (glycine) dioxouranium (VI) nitrate. Chapter 9 covers the kinetics of luminescence quenching of *[U 02] 2 + by amino acids (indicating the level of reactivity) and the quant yields of [U(IV) ] which indicate the degree of charge separation from the initial radical-pair configuration, while cryogenic ESR data reveal the nature of the primary ligand-derived radical. Interestingly we find that while much the greatest kinetic reactivity towards *[UO 2] 2 + is shown by the sulphur-containing amino acids, these show very low yields for [U(IV) ] production. This pattern is repeated in our study of the photo-oxidation of dialkyl sulphides by excited uranyl ion, in which we believe to have demonstrated that a. recent report of high quantum yields in this system and published in Inorganic Chemistry is erroneous. Our brief study of the aqueous [W(CN) 8] 3 - system confirms the quantum yields for [W(CN) 8] 4 - of Samotus et al., as opposed to the earlier data of Balzani and Carassiti and characterises, using ESR, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, new W(V) -cyanide 4 complexes obtained during irradiation into the C-T bands of [W(CN) 8] 4 - and [W(CN) 8] 3 - in aqueous solution.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} argued that cannabinoids exert {{part of their}} analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects via activation of the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor located on TRPV 1 -expressing primary sensory nerve fibres in peripheral tissues. However, we find no evidence of CB 1 receptor immunoreactivity on nerve fibres in rat or mouse hindpaw skin and mesenteric artery. The CB 1 receptor agonists anandamide and HU 210 also fail to inhibit TRPV 1 -mediated calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from primary sensory neurons in rat hindpaw skin and mesenteric artery. Therefore, this study {{do not support the}} general view that the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CB 1 receptor agonists are due to direct inhibition of TRPV 1 -expressing primary sensory nerve terminals in the periphery. Garlic contains a number of <b>organosulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> including allicin and diallyl disulfide (DADS), some of which may contribute to its pungent and vasodilator properties. Our results show that raw garlic extract, allicin and DADS activate TRPA 1 ion channels on primary sensory neurons in culture and nerve fibres in the vascular system. These findings highlight TRPA 1 as a novel ion channel in the vascular system and provide novel pharmacological tools for investigating the role of this ion channel. Whether activation of TRPA 1 in the vascular system explains the beneficial antihypertensive effect observed by garlic treatment remains to be shown. This study also expands our understanding of how TRPA 1 is regulated on a molecular basis, which is of importance for development of novel drug therapies for pain, inflammation and vascular disease. The skin is a major sensory organ that contains a large number of nerves. The TRP ion channels TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 are expressed in the somatosensory nervous system in animals and are therefore likely to be expressed in humans as well. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was used to identify these channels and compare their expression and distribution patterns with known neuronal markers of the sensory nervous system in skin from healthy volunteers and from individuals with a mutation in the gene encoding nerve growth factor beta (NGF?) that causes Norrbottnian congenital insensitivity to pain. This study shows {{for the first time the}} presence of TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 in sensory nerves in the human skin. TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 as well as TRPV 1 immunoreactive nerve fibres are present in unmyelinated nerve fibres in epidermis and papillary dermis, in nerve bundles, and around blood vessels and hair follicles. In contrast to TRPV 1, TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 are found mainly in the papillary dermis and seem to be restricted to peptidergic nerve fibres, of which the majority contains the sensory neuropeptides CGRP or SP. There is a substantial loss of nerve fibres containing TRPV 1, TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 in skin from individuals with Norrbottnian congenital insensitivity to pain. Insight into the role of TRPV 2 and TRPM 8 in human skin may open new avenues for treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory skin diseases...|$|R
