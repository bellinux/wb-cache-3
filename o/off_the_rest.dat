5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had to dig in near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

By 1992 the building was 85 percent vacant and in December of that year the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seized Meritor Financial Group and sold <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of its bank branches to Mellon Bank. The FDIC took control of Meritor's remaining assets including the PSFS Building.

25|$|Dholes {{appear in}} Rudyard Kipling's Red Dog, {{where they are}} portrayed as {{aggressive}} and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the Deccan Plateau into the Seeonee Hills inhabited by Mowgli and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even Shere Khan and Hathi make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and Kaa's help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages {{to wipe out the}} dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> in battle.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, he Judicial Committee of the Privy Council {{decided in}} the Southern Rhodesia case that, even {{although}} the British South Africa Company may have conquered Mashonaland and Matabeleland, it had acted {{as an agent of}} the British Crown, so the land had become Crown land. The court recognised that the indigenous people of what became Southern Rhodesia, had previously owned the land, but had lost it through the BSAC conquest. However, even after the Privy Council decision, the British government allowed BSAC to continue to administer the unalienated lands in Southern Rhodesia and agreed that, when their Charter expired, it was to recover the loss it had incurred in administering the territory either from future sales of these lands or from the British government. In negotiations for the ending of the Charter in 1923, the British government agreed to fund part of this deficit, but placed the obligation to pay <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> on Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E

25|$|On stage 3 of the Tour de Suisse, Sagan {{showed that}} {{he still has the}} ability to climb with the best in the sport. After making the {{selection}} on the category one climb, Sagan was able to distance himself along with Rui Costa, Roman Kreuziger and Mathias Frank on the final wet and narrow descent. The four held <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the field and Sagan took the stage victory. Sagan cemented his victory in the points classification by taking the eighth stage, which was flatter and more suited to the sprinters. He got the best of Daniele Bennati and Philippe Gilbert. He then {{went on to win the}} Slovak Road Race Championships for the third time, stating that he would be happy to harbor the national emblem on his jersey for the Tour de France. At the Tour, Sagan scored numerous second positions before winning stage 7 to Albi, after his team worked to shed the pure sprinters on the Category 2 Col de la Croix de Mounis. He outsprinted the select group he was part of, crossing the line before John Degenkolb. Sagan retained the green jersey to Paris and dyed his beard green to underline that victory. He then went on to win the sprints classification and numerous stages in the USA Pro Cycling Challenge (4 stage wins) and the Tour of Alberta (2 stage wins). Sagan got short of success in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec where he accelerated strongly on one of the final climbs but faded in sight of the finishing line. He compensated two days later by taking victory in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, escaping the leading group on a climb with five kilometers to go and winning solo.|$|E

500|$|Barber's head of Liberty {{is purely}} classical, and is {{rendered}} in the Roman style. The head is {{modeled after the}} French [...] "Ceres" [...] silver coinage of the late 19th century, but bears a resemblance to Morgan's design for the silver dollar. This did not escape numismatist Walter Breen in his comprehensive guide to U.S. coins: [...] "Barber must have been feeling unusually lazy. He left the [...] rev design {{as it had been}} since 1860, with minor simplifications. His obv was a mirror image of the Morgan dollar head, with much of Miss Anna Willess Williams's back hair cropped <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> concealed... within a disproportionately large cap." [...] In his text introducing the Barber quarter, Breen states, [...] "the whole composition is Germanically stolid, prosy, crowded (especially on rev), and without discernible merit aside from the technical one of low relief". Burdette terms Barber's designs, [...] "typically mediocre imitations of the current French-style—hardly better than the arcane seated Liberty type they replaced".|$|E
500|$|Viking raids {{increased}} in the early 840s {{on both sides of}} the English Channel, and in 843 Æthelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton in Somerset. In 850 sub-king Æthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere of Kent won a naval victory over a large Viking fleet off Sandwich in Kent, capturing nine ships and driving <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> Æthelwulf granted Ealhhere a large estate in Kent, but Æthelstan is not heard of again, and probably died soon afterwards. The following year the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records five different attacks on southern England. A Danish fleet of 350 Viking ships took London and Canterbury, and when King Berhtwulf of Mercia went to their relief he was defeated. The Vikings then moved on to Surrey, where they were defeated by Æthelwulf and his son Æthelbald at the Battle of Aclea. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the West Saxon levies [...] "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen that we have heard tell of up to the present day". The Chronicle frequently reported victories during Æthelwulf's reign won by levies led by ealdormen, unlike the 870s when royal command was emphasised, reflecting a more consensual style of leadership in the earlier period.|$|E
500|$|Miller bowled a {{fast and}} very short bouncer at Compton, who moved into {{position}} to hook before changing {{his mind and}} attempting to evade the ball. He lost balance and threw his legs apart, trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps. However, he was unsuccessful and was out hit wicket for 184, having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours. Wisden said: [...] "No praise could be too high for {{the manner in which}} Compton carried the side's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances." [...] Fingleton said it was [...] "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always". O'Reilly described it as [...] "an unsavoury ending to [...] one of the greatest fighting knocks in Test history". Compton's fall at 405/7 exposed the English tail and Australia quickly finished <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the batsmen in 36 minutes. Miller bowled Lakerwho played outside the line of the ballfor four, Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston, who then castled Young for nine. England were all out for 441 after 183 overs, leaving Australia a target of 98 in three hours. Lindwall's absence throughout the England innings meant the remaining four Australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each—Johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4/147 while Miller took 4/125 from 44 overs. Toshack and Johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively.|$|E
