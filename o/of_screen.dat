5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market for writers <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E

5|$|In December 1952, Kurosawa {{took his}} Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded {{residence}} at an inn {{to create the}} screenplay for his next movie, Seven Samurai. The ensemble work was Kurosawa's first proper samurai film, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in Sengoku period Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> time.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Analysing {{trends in}} {{population}} breast cancer mortality statistics appears a simple {{method of estimating}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> mammographic <b>screening</b> programmes. We reviewed such studies <b>of</b> population-based <b>screening</b> in Europe to assess their value. METHODS: A literature review identified 17 papers, of which 12 provided quantitative estimates of the impact <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Due to differences in comparisons and outcome measures, no pooled estimate of effectiveness was calculated. RESULTS: Comparisons included breast cancer mortality {{before and after the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> trends in early and late starting areas and trends in age groups affected and unaffected by screening. Studies that calculated the percentage annual change after the start <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> found reductions <b>of</b> 1 - 9 % per year (1 %, 2. 3 - 2. 8 % and 9 % for those with adequate follow-up). Of studies that compared mortality in time periods before and after introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> three single country studies all had adequate follow-up and estimated mortality reductions ranging from 28 % to 36 %. Limitations of studies of population mortality rates include the inability to exclude deaths in women with breast cancer diagnosed before invitation to screening, diluting any observable impact <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> and the gradual implementation <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> in a country or region. CONCLUSIONS: Although analysing population breast cancer mortality rates over time can be a first step in examining changes following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> this method is of limited value for assessment <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> impact. Other methods and individual data are necessary to properly quantify the effect...|$|R

5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem.

5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top <b>of</b> <b>screen.</b> This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition <b>of</b> <b>screen</b> costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Several {{practice}} guidelines recommend routine {{screening for}} psychological distress in cancer care. The {{objective was to}} evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> cancer patients for psychological distress by assessing the (1) effectiveness of interventions to reduce distress among patients identified as distressed; and (2) effects <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> for distress on distress outcomes. Methods: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE;PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched through April 6, 2011 with manual searches of 45 relevant journals, reference list review, citation tracking of included articles, and trial registry reviews through June 30, 2012. Articles in any language on cancer patients were included if they (1) compared treatment for patients with psychological distress to placebo or usual care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); or (2) assessed the effect <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> on psychological distress in a RCT. Results: There were 14 eligible RCTs for treatment of distress, and 1 RCT on the effects <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> on patient distress. Pharmacological, psychotherapy and collaborative care interventions generally reduced distress with small to moderate effects. One study investigated effects <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> for distress On psychological outcomes, and it found no improvement Conclusion: Treatment studies reported modest improvement in distress symptoms, but only a single eligible study {{was found on the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> cancer patients for distress, and distress did not improve in screened patients versus those receiving usual care. Because of the lack of evidence of beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> cancer patients for distress, it is premature to recommend or mandate implementation <b>of</b> routine <b>screening.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
