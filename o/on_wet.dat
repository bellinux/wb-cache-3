40|$|This method {{outlines}} {{the procedure for}} {{the determination of the}} free swell of a disturbed soil <b>on</b> <b>wetting.</b> Soils that shrink or fail to saturate are usually dispersible. This might mask the extent of volume expansion and a linear shrinkage test is recommended to indicate the likelihood of shrink-swell behaviour. This test is only performed for dispersive soil. PRINCIPLE This test measures the free swelling of a disturbed soil (i. e. ground and sieved finer than 0. 425 mm) <b>on</b> <b>wetting</b> from air-dry to saturation. The swell is calculated on a volumetric basis using a modification of the Keen-Raczowski test...|$|R
25|$|Biofouling or {{biological}} fouling is {{the accumulation of}} microorganisms, plants, algae, or animals <b>on</b> <b>wetted</b> surfaces. Such accumulation {{is referred to as}} epibiosis when the host surface is another organism and the relationship is not parasitic.|$|R
5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{was less}} {{effective}} in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he slipped <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> grass {{when he was}} about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.|$|E
5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common <b>on</b> <b>wet,</b> poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
50|$|NBSK from Scandinavia is {{only from}} scots pine and norway spruce {{in the normal}} mix 7:3. The mix might vary much with the season as norway spruce grows <b>on</b> <b>wetter</b> lands that is easier {{accessed}} in the winter when the ground is frozen.|$|R

5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} populations of sarus cranes in South-east Asia: the northern population in China and Myanmar, {{and the southern}} population in Cambodia and Vietnam. The sarus used to extend to Thailand and further east into the Philippines, but may now be extinct in both these countries. In 2011, 24 captive bred cranes raised from five original founders were reintroduced into Thailand. In Australia they are found only in the northern parts, and are partly migratory in some areas. The global range has shrunk and the largest occupied area is now in India. With marshlands largely destroyed, these cranes are increasingly dependent <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> paddy fields in India. Although now found mainly at a low elevation on the plains, there are some historical records from highland marshes further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir. The sarus crane breeds in some high elevation regions such as near the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, where populations may be growing in response to increasing rice cultivation along the reservoir. In rice-dominated districts of Uttar Pradesh, sarus crane abundance (estimated as occupancy) was highest in the western districts, intermediate in the central districts, and minimal in the eastern districts. Sarus crane abundance was positively associated with percentage of wetlands on the landscape, and negatively with the percentage of area under rice cultivation.|$|E
40|$|Residually derived {{red soils}} occur in Bangalore District of Karnataka State, India. The porous and {{unsaturated}} {{nature of the}} red soils makes them susceptible to collapse <b>on</b> <b>wetting</b> under load. The present study analyses the collapse behaviour of an unsaturated bonded (undisturbed) red soil from Bangalore referenced to tests on samples in an unbonded (remoulded) state. A filter paper method {{was used to determine}} the matric suction of the bonded and unbonded specimens, and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was used to determine their soil structure. Analysis of the experimental results shows that bonding {{plays an important role in}} the collapse behaviour of the unsaturated residual soil. The results of the study also provide insight into the volume change behaviour of unsaturated bonded soils <b>on</b> <b>wetting</b> within and beyond the yield locus...|$|R
25|$|Another {{major threat}} facing the {{condition}} of the wetlands in Yanga National Park is habitat loss and fragmentation.

Using different spin systems models and different numerical and approximate methods such as mean field and effective field theories, real space renormalization group technique, transfer matrix method and Monte-Carlo simulations, it is found that the wetting and layering transitions depend {{on the nature of the}} surface magnetic field, the surface coupling strength, the surface crystal field, the geometry of surface, the in-homogeneity of substrate and the quantum fluctuations at the surface&# 65533...|$|R
40|$|Theories for inhomogeneous fluids {{have focused}} {{in recent years}} <b>on</b> <b>wetting,</b> {{capillary}} conden- sation, and solvation forces for model systems where the surface(s) is(are) smooth homogeneous parallel plates, cylinders, or spherical drops.

In this paper we discuss the conse- quences of chemical heterogeneity <b>on</b> <b>wetting.</b> Specifically, a 2 -dimensional implementation of a nonlocal density functional theory is solved for a striped surface model. Both the strength and range of the heterogeneity are varied. Contact angles are calculated, and phase transitions (both the wetting transition and a local layering transition) are located. The wetting properties of the surface ase shown to be strongly dependent on the nature of the surface heterogeneity. In addition highly ordered nanoscopic phases are found, and the operational limits for formation of ordered or crystalline phases of nanoscopic extent are discussed...|$|R
