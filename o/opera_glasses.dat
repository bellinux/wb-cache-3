25|$|Around {{and above}} the map were more tellers who {{controlled}} the communications, connecting incoming reports to the plotter on the floor nearest that location on the map or connecting incoming requests for information to another teller who could read the map. Tellers examined the track markers, whose larger print allowed them to see the information, although this sometimes required <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> Sometimes information {{would have to be}} plotted that came from an external source, not normally part of the reporting chain; a fighter calling an SOS would report this through his radio on an emergency frequency, which would be picked up by the closest listening post. This information would also flow into the filter room but they were not connected to the plotters on the floor. Operators above the map could mark locations of interest using theatrical spotlights and filters allowed them to change the message being projected.|$|E
500|$|Other {{parts of}} the story also derive from the author's life: Balzac once {{attended}} a feast held by the Marquis de Las Marismas, who planned to launch a newspaper– the same situation in which Valentin finds himself after expressing his first wish to the talisman. Later, Valentin visits the opera armed with a powerful set of glasses that allow him to observe every flaw in the women on stage (to guard against desire). These {{may also have been}} drawn from Balzac's experience, as he once wrote in a letter about a set of [...] "divine" [...] <b>opera</b> <b>glasses</b> he ordered from the Paris Observatory.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{opened on}} 1 June 1891. Ticket holders began queuing at 9:30am, {{and the court}} was full {{half an hour before}} its 11am start time. The prince sat on a red leather chair on a raised {{platform}} between the judge and the witness box; his appearance was the first time since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court. The Pall Mall Gazette stated that [...] "the court presented an appearance which, save for the dignity of its own fittings and its rows of learned-looking law books, might have been taken for a theatre at a fashionable matinée", with society ladies watching proceedings with <b>opera</b> <b>glasses</b> or lorgnettes. The correspondent of The Manchester Guardian described the opening of the case as being [...] "in the presence of a carefully selected and fashionable assembly", while Clarke later wrote that [...] "the court had a strange appearance. Lord Coleridge had appropriated half of the public gallery, and had given tickets to his friends".|$|E
5000|$|A young Dutch-Indian {{journalist}} {{who is on}} vacation in Dresden decides to visit the Semperoper to see a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre. He gets {{a seat in the}} fourth range, in the most upper part of the auditorium. On the day of the performance, he buys himself an <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> to see the play better. During the performance, he feels an almost irresistible urge to throw the <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> to the head of a bald man sitting in the gallery right below him. Frightened by his own thought, he leaves the <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> in the building after the play.|$|R

500|$|... "W.T.F." [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on October 21, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. [...] "W.T.F." [...] parodies several aspects of professional wrestling, a form of theatre involving mock combat and catch wrestling, in which matches, along with pre- and post-match commentary and action, are choreographed and scripted. The South Park episode highlights the theatrical elements of professional wrestling, such as the costumes, back stories and scripted dramatic storylines. The fans are portrayed as far more interested in these theatrical elements than any actual athletic feats. The theatrical aspect of professional wrestling are often over-exaggerated in [...] "W.T.F." [...] to add comedic emphasis and satire. For example, a try-out involves no actual wrestling at all, but rather dramatic monologues, and resembles the audition scene from the Broadway musical [...] "A Chorus Line". Similarly, Vince McMahon watches one of the matches from a balcony wearing <b>opera</b> <b>glasses,</b> similar to that of a theatre rather than a traditional wrestling venue.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} from Canada, a family friend, Vivian Van Damm, took him on as {{assistant}} manager at the Windmill Theatre, where his job included spotting audience members misbehaving or using <b>opera</b> <b>glasses</b> {{to look at the}} nude players during its Revudeville variety shows. He was soon promoted to playing straight man in the Revudeville comedy routines, appearing in his first sketch in August 1935.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Whall’s {{works in}} Gloucester Cathedral is the {{magnificent}} South African War Memorial window, the Great East Window in the Chapter House. Concerning this window, [...] Whall {{points out that}} there is a full description available on a notice board just by the window and he reminds us that the Chapter House was the building in which the Domesday Book was compiled and points out that the lower centre lights of the window represent William the Conqueror directing the compilation of the Book. [...] He asks us to notice the map hanging {{over the edge of the}} table and says that with the help of <b>opera</b> <b>glasses</b> the ancient names of the towns may be read.|$|E

2500|$|The {{installation}} of the work was as unique as its dimension and detail. There is no record of the [...] appearance or arrangement of the Studio Building exhibit. It has been widely claimed, although probably falsely, that the room was decorated with palm fronds and that gaslights with silver reflectors were used to illuminate the painting. More certain is that the painting's casement-window–like [...] "frame" [...] had a breadth of fourteen feet and a height of almost thirteen, which further imposed the painting upon the viewer. It was likely made of brown chestnut, {{a departure from the}} prevailing gilt frame. [...] The base of the edifice stood on the ground, ensuring that the landscape's horizon would be displayed at the viewer's eye level. Drawn curtains were fitted, creating the sense of a view out a window. A skylight directed at the canvas heightened the perception that the painting was illuminated from within, as did the dark fabrics draped on the studio walls to absorb light. <b>Opera</b> <b>glasses</b> were provided to patrons to allow examination of the landscape's details, and may have been necessary to satisfactorily view the painting at all, given the crowding in the exhibition room.|$|E

6000|$|THE curtain rises, {{disclosing}} the ushers of {{the theater}} still {{moving up and down}} the aisles. Cries of [...] "Program!" [...] "Program!" [...] are heard.

5000|$|Five years later, {{the same}} man is back again in Dresden and decides one more {{time to go to}} a {{performance}} of Die Walküre. The performance is again in the Semperoper, and he gets exactly the same seat as before. To his dismay, an usherette gives him the <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> which he had left behind in the building the previous time. A few moments after the play has started, he throws the <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> right against the head of a spectator who is sitting next to the married couple right below him.

60|$|The {{evidence}} of the ghost-seer was republished by Mrs. Crowe, in her Night Side of Nature. But Mrs. Crowe neither gives {{the facts of the}} trial correctly, nor indicates the sources of the narrative. The source was a periodical, The <b>Opera</b> <b>Glass,</b> February 3, 1827, thirty years after the date of the trial. The document, however, had existed 'for many years,' in the possession of the anonymous contributor to The <b>Opera</b> <b>Glass.</b> He received it from one of the counsel in the case, Mr. Nicholson, afterwards a judge in Maryland, who compiled it from attested notes made by himself in court.|$|R

50|$|De binocle (translation: The <b>opera</b> <b>glass)</b> is a {{short story}} written by Louis Couperus {{probably}} in or around 1897 in Dresden. The story was published {{for the first time}} in 1920 in Haagse Post and later in Proza.|$|R
60|$|The gentleman, who, as it happened, was an Englishman, made {{no reply}} to this observation, but quietly took out an <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> from a case, which was {{strapped}} over his shoulder, and began studying the sculptures on the column.|$|R

60|$|Even this {{failed to}} touch us. His father--he told us with undiminished candour--had been a German {{emigrant}} {{who had come}} over in '49, after the cause of liberty had {{been lost in the}} old country, and made eye-glasses and <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> There hadn't been a fortune in it. He, Hermann, had worked at various occupations in the summer time, from peddling to farming, until he had saved enough to start him at Harvard. Tom, who had been bending over his bureau drawer, straightened up.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{habit of}} the late Marquis de St. Eustache," [...] said the new policeman, {{producing}} a leather case, [...] "always to carry a pair of <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> Either the President or the Secretary is coming after us with that mob. They have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police. Dr. Bull, I have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{great number}} of {{tourists}} on board the steamer. Rollo could see them very distinctly sitting under the awning on the deck. Some were standing by the railing and examining the raft by means of their spy glasses or <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> Others were seated at tables, eating late breakfasts, in little parties by themselves. The boat glided by very swiftly, however, and soon Rollo could see nothing of her but the stern, and the foaming wake which her paddle wheels left behind them in the water.|$|E
50|$|Arthritis mutilans {{is a rare}} medical {{condition}} involving severe inflammation damaging the joints of the hands and feet, and resulting in deformation and problems with moving the affected areas; it can also affect the spine. As an uncommon arthropathy, arthritis mutilans was originally described as affecting the hands, feet, fingers, and/or toes, but can refer in general to severe derangement of any joint damaged by arthropathy. First described in modern medical literature by Marie and Leri in 1913, in the hands, arthritis mutilans {{is also known as}} <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> hand (la main en lorgnette in French), or chronic absorptive arthritis. Sometimes there is foot involvement in which toes shorten and on which painful calluses develop in a condition known as <b>opera</b> <b>glass</b> foot, or pied en lorgnette.|$|R

60|$|We skirted around {{two-thirds of}} the island, four miles from shore, and all the <b>opera</b> <b>glasses</b> in the ship were called into {{requisition}} to settle disputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees or groves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea were really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries. Finally we stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly became a dome of mud again and sank down among the mists, and disappeared. But to many a seasick passenger {{it was good to}} see the green hills again, and all were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could have expected them to be, considering how sinfully early they had gotten up.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the bright}} side of the moon," [...] replied Bradley gravely. They looked around, and studied the people with a mental {{comparison}} with other throngs they had seen on the far prairies of Kansas and Iowa. There were girls with eyes full of liquid light, with dainty bonnets nestling on their soft hair; their faces were like petals of flowers; the curves of their chins were more beautiful than chalices of lilies; their dresses, soft, shapely, of exquisite tones and texture, draped their perfect bodies. Their slender fingers held gold-and-pearl <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> The young men who sat beside them wore the latest fashions in clothing cut from the finest fabrics. Heavy men of brutal bulk slouched beside their dainty daughters, the purple blotches on their bloated and lumpy faces showing how politics or business had debauched and undermined them. Everywhere was the rustle of drapery and soft, musical speech. All that was lacking in [...] "the round up" [...] at Chiquita was here--shining, fragrant, and rustling.|$|E
60|$|She {{was a sad}} coquette; and did {{not turn}} away, as she was bound to do, from the dandy glances of the cabin bucks, who ogled her through their double-barreled <b>opera</b> <b>glasses.</b> This enraged the tailor past telling; he would remonstrate with his wife, and scold her; and lay his matrimonial {{commands}} upon her, to go below instantly, out of sight. But the lady {{was not to be}} tyrannized over; and so she told him. Meantime, the bucks would be still framing her in their lenses, mightily enjoying the fun. The last resources of the poor tailor would be, to start up, and make a dash at the rogues, with clenched fists; but upon getting as far as the mainmast, the mate would accost him from over the rope that divided them, and beg leave to communicate the fact, that he could come no further. This unfortunate tailor was also a fiddler; and when fairly baited into desperation, would rush for his instrument, and try to get rid of his wrath by playing the most savage, remorseless airs he could think of.|$|E
