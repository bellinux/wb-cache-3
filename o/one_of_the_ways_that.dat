25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E

500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> Biko and the BCM {{sought to}} achieve {{psychological}} empowerment was through community development. Community projects were seen {{not only as}} a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically. They would also help students to learn about the [...] "daily struggles" [...] of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population. Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques. Healthcare was also a priority, with SASO members focusing on primary and preventative care.|$|E
500|$|Denny Mooney was {{appointed}} chairman of Holden on 1 January 2004, {{by which time}} development of the VE Commodore was well underway. Key design and engineering work was being finalised, and investment was already being made in making the tooling with which to manufacture the car. One of Mooney's priorities was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores. The interior quality benefited dramatically from this additional emphasis; Mooney pushed for panel gaps to be reduced by a further [...] over previous targets. Smaller panel gaps are just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> Holden have developed the VE to pitch it against the European competitors. Through the use of advanced steels and intensive design, the body structure is 50percent stiffer than the outgoing model, benefiting from noise and vibration reductions, handling and crash safety. However the new body has resulted in substantially increased weight over the outgoing model.|$|E

2500|$|Foucault's {{discussions on}} power and {{discourse}} have inspired many critical theorists, {{who believe that}} Foucault's analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality.

2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> Wells {{expressed}} {{himself was}} through his drawings and sketches.

During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures [...] "picshuas". These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.|$|E

[...] With regard to the impact of leaks for big recording artists, former Capitol Records senior Vice President and General Manager, Lou Mann stated: [...] "For the Wallflowers or any major superstar band, the problems are major. [...] In fact they're Herculean, because people already want it and you don't want to dilute your audience." [...] Jakob Dylan also explained his feelings about (Breach) being leaked: [...] " [...] <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> we have of making a living really.

When Ronne and Darlington decided to {{accompany}} their husbands in 1946 to Antarctica, men on the expedition [...] "signed a petition trying to stop it happening." [...] Ronne worked as the mission's [...] "recorder." [...] Ronne and Darlington both wrote about their experiences on the ice, {{and in the case}} of Darlington's book, about how conflict between team members also [...] "strained relations between the two women." [...] <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> Darlington tried to fit in with the men of the group was to make herself as [...] "inconspicuous within the group as possible."

2500|$|In hip hop culture, it is {{considered}} essential to [...] "keep it real" [...] or to be authentic to the lived experiences of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods ("the Ghetto"). Despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps, the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true. Because of this, lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as [...] "confessions" [...] {{to a number of}} violent crimes in the United States. It is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists (DJs, dancers) to [...] "represent" [...] their city and neighborhood. This demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame, and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti. This has potentially been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> hip hop has become regarded as a [...] "local" [...] rather than [...] "foreign" [...] genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades. Nevertheless, sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu, and an album like the surprise hit Kala by Anglo-Tamil rapper M.I.A. was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track.|$|E

It has indeed been a fatal custom, but it has been too long a city vanity. If men of quality lived like themselves, men of no quality would strive to live not like themselves: if those had plenty, these would have profusion; if those had enough, these would have excess; if those had what was good, these would have what was rare and exotic; I mean as to season, and consequently dear. And this is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> have worn out so many tradesmen before their time.|$|E
