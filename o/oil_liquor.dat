On March 8, 1814, he married Rebecca Matlack of Goshen, granddaughter {{of one of}} the borough’s first farmers. After finding success in Pughtown, he went on to open stores in Tredyffrin Township, West Goshen, and West Whiteland before opening a {{location}} in West Chester in 1824. Items he sold included fine cloths, silks, clothing, eye glasses, medicines, paints and <b>oils,</b> and <b>liquors</b> -- many imported from Europe.|$|R
50|$|Guo's father, one {{of whose}} names may {{possibly}} have been Guo Mingxing (1854-1939), had {{to drop out of}} school at the age of 13 and then spent six months as an apprentice at a salt well. Thereafter he entered his father's business, a shrewd and smart man who achieved some local renown as a Chinese medical doctor, traded successfully in <b>oils,</b> opium, <b>liquor,</b> and grain and operated a money changing business. His business success allowed him to increase the family's real estate and salt well holdings.|$|R
5000|$|Coal {{delivered}} by rail, first {{from the nearby}} Bolsover colliery, and later from other sources, was heated in 8 large air sealed ovens called [...] "batteries". Volatile constituents were driven off and condensed into coal oil and a watery fraction called ammoniacal liquor. Coal gas was used to heat the ovens and also burned in the works boilers and furnaces. Any excess was flared off. The coal <b>oil</b> and <b>liquor</b> were piped over {{the road to the}} chemical works section where they were processed into various fractions and industrial chemicals. The residual Coalite solid fuel was cooled, then sorted into various grades based on size and stockpiled for distribution by road transport.|$|R
50|$|Statehood brought {{prohibition}} {{to all of}} Oklahoma, and {{the population}} of Earlsboro quickly dropped to 387. The local economy subsequently relied on agriculture instead of <b>liquor.</b> <b>Oil</b> was struck nearby on March 1, 1926. The first well produced 200 barrels a day. News of the strike attracted workers, and the town population increased to an estimated ten thousand people within two months. The ensuing boom led to construction of a one hundred thousand dollar hotel, a large theater, and {{many different kinds of}} business. In 1929, the town passed a $225,000 bond issue to construct a water and sewer system. The population was officially 1,950 at the 1930 census.|$|R
40|$|A self-design {{experimental}} {{system was}} employed to improve the concentration of essential oils for Pao-chung oolong tea-leaf by using supercritical CO ?? extraction. The effects of temperature, CO ?? flow rate, back-pressure, {{and the addition of}} co-solvent on the extractive efficiency were studied. The densimeter was used to determine the concentrationof essential <b>oils</b> in the <b>liquor.</b> Results showed that the concentration of tea oils was found to increase with temperature, ranged from 25 ℃ to 60 ℃, but decreased at 80 ℃. It evidenced that the mass transfer between the oils-laden liquid CO ?? phase and the liquor phase was so slow that absorption alone controlled the overall extraction rate. The effect of co-solvent results in higher concentration of tea oils and increases with the amount of addition. 本研究以自行設計之超臨界流體萃取實驗裝置，進行二氧化碳萃取包種烏龍茶， 並製成茶酒且探討濃度及萃取效率。內容含溫度、流速、吸收槽背壓、改性劑添加量諸效應 對於茶酒中可溶性成分及總濃度變化的影響。當壓力為 4500 psig，溫度範圍為 25 ℃至 60 ℃時，萃出濃度隨溫度上昇而增大，顯示茶葉精油之蒸汽壓控制萃出濃度，但 80 ℃時，由 於二氧化碳密度下降，使得萃取效果降低。經實驗得知，較高流速下之茶葉精油萃出濃度較 佳，證明二氧化碳流速僅影響茶葉粉粒外部質傳阻力。改性劑添加量對茶葉精油的萃出率有 正面影響，且隨添加量增加而增大...|$|R

40|$|Food {{traceability}} is {{an important}} measure to secure food safety. This paper designed a food traceability platform based on distribution framework and implemented it in Guangdong province. The platform can provide traceability service, production and management service for food enterprise, provide forward and backward traceability of the whole cycle of food production and circulation, and provide various methods of food traceability for public. One characteristic of the platform is that it opens up the data flow among production, circulation and supervising departments, and builds a unified commodity circulation data pool. Based on the flow data pool, not only the production and circulation information of the food product can be traced, but also its inspection and quarantine information. Another characteristic of the platform is that its database and data interface were developed based on the fool electronic traceability standards formulated by the National Food and Drug Administration. Its interface standardization and compatibility with other food traceability platforms can thus be guaranteed. The platform is running at Guangdong province for key supervising products of Infant formula foods (including milk powder, rice flour, farina, etc), editable <b>oil</b> and <b>liquor.</b> The public can use the Guangdong food traceability portal, mobile APP, Wechat or the self-service terminals in the supermarkets to trace food products by scanning or input its traceability code or its product code and verify its authenticity. It will help to promote consumer confidence in food safety...|$|R
30|$|Solubility of edible film {{in water}} is an {{essential}} asset and water resistance is typically mandatory for possible commercial applications of the edible film. After the 24  h incubation in distilled water, the control gelatin film consequently altered its shape, while the Acacia lignin-gelatin films were found to retain their integrity. Addition of lignin into gelatin film brought about a pronounced decrease in film solubility, from 59.15 (control) to 32.57  % (LG-E) (Table  1). The high water resistance property of lignin-gelatin blended film is possibly due to the interaction and miscibility of phenolic compounds of lignin with amino groups of gelatin. Similar behavior was observed for sago starch films incorporated with lignin isolated from <b>oil</b> palm black <b>liquor</b> waste (Bhat et al. 2013). Literature also suggests that the incorporation of lignin alters the helical structure of gelatin, thereby, subsequently reducing the water solubility of the film (Nunez-Flores et al. 2012; Pena et al. 2010).|$|R
60|$|At {{the door}} of this {{sanctuary}} {{it is necessary to}} pause, in order to correct the reports with which Richie Moniplies had filled his master's ear, respecting the singular appearance of that lady's attendance at prayers, whom we now own to be by name the Lady Hermione. Some part of these exaggerations had been communicated to the worthy Scotsman by Jenkin Vincent, who was well experienced in the species of wit which has been long a favourite in the city, under the names of cross-biting, giving the dor, bamboozling, cramming, hoaxing, humbugging, and quizzing; for which sport Richie Moniplies, with his solemn gravity, totally unapprehensive of a joke, and his natural propensity to the marvellous, formed an admirable subject. Farther ornaments the tale had received from Richie himself, whose tongue, especially when <b>oiled</b> with good <b>liquor,</b> had a considerable tendency to amplification, and who failed not, while he retailed to his master all the wonderful circumstances narrated by Vincent, to add to them many conjectures of his own, which his imagination had over-hastily converted into facts.|$|R

Then comes Lucky Raam(Vicky's father), who is a local goon and produces fake ghee(edible <b>oil)</b> and poisonous <b>liquor.</b> Abhimanyu, as a true police officer starts to destroy the son-father duo's illegal business. He then arrests Vicky with his consignment of fake ghee, but was released on bail later. Somehow, Vicky manages some video clip of Meenal having indecent content. He threatens Shamsher Singh to stop Abhimanyu from catching their supply else this video will surface on the Internet. Shamsher Singh tells Meenal not to see Abhimanyu anymore. Startled by her strange behaviour, Abhimanyu couldn't understand what's going on with her. Vicky's business starts to flourish again. 37 people die due to consumption of liquor supplied by Vicky. When they lost the video clip, they kidnap Meenal and threaten Shamsher Singh to kill her, if he doesn't stop Abhimanyu from arresting them. Later on, Abhimanyu rescues her and they get married.|$|R
5000|$|The ancient Greek {{botanist}} Theophrastus {{described the}} manufacturing of stacte: [...] "From the myrrh, {{when it is}} bruised flows an oil; {{it is in fact}} called [...] "stacte" [...] because it comes in drops slowly." [...] The ancient Roman historian Pliny, in Natural History, described stacte as, [...] "the liquid which exuded naturally from the myrrh tree before the gum was collected from man-made incisions." [...] Pancirollus described myrrh as a drop or tear distilling from a tree in Arabia Felix, and stacte as a drop of myrrh, which is extracted from it, and yielding a most precious liquid. Dioscorides wrote that stacte was made from myrrh. He recorded that after having bruised the myrrh and dissolved it in oil of balanos over a gentle fire, hot water was poured over it. The myrrh and oil would sink to the bottom like a deposit; and as soon as this has occurred, they strained off the water and squeeze the sediment in a press. Stoddart, who lists myrrh as a balm, informs us that [...] "Myrrh—after the almost clear stacte has passed through—is reddish brown [...] [...] [...] Stacte is the thinnest moiety of myrrh, the very best of which is forced through tiny holes in the intact bark at the start of spring." [...] Pomet wrote that to obtain stacte one must first gather the myrrh [...] "that flows spontaneously from the tree" [...] and to look for portions of the resin which are [...] "clear and transparent, apt to crumble, light." [...] He says to choose the myrrh [...] "that when it is broke, has little white spots in it." [...] We are told that [...] "stacte is that liquid part which is found in the center or middle of the lumps or clots of myrrh." [...] Pomet also wrote that stacte is that [...] "which is first so gather'd from the tree without force, and also press'd from the myrrh [...] [...] [...] there is prepar'd from it, an extract, an <b>oil</b> or <b>liquor</b> of myrrh." ...|$|R
40|$|Waste from {{agricultural}} products represents a disposal liability, which {{needs to be}} addressed. Palm oil is the most widely traded edible oil globally, and its production generates 85 million tons of aqueous by-products annually. This aqueous stream is rich in phenolic antioxi-dants, which were investigated for their composition and potential in vitro biological activity. We have identified three isomers of caffeoyl-shikimic acid as major components of oil palm phenolics (OPP). The 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay confirmed potent free radical scavenging activity. To test for possible cardioprotective effects of OPP, we carried out in vitro LDL oxidation studies as well as ex vivo aortic ring and mesenteric vascular bed relaxation measurements. We found that OPP inhibited the Cu-mediated oxidation of human LDL. OPP also promoted vascular relaxation in both isolated aortic rings and perfused mesenteric vascular beds pre-contracted with nor-adrenaline. To rule out developmental toxicity, we performed teratological studies on rats up to the third generation and {{did not find any}} congenital anomalies. Thus, these initial studies suggest that OPP is safe and may have a protective role against free radical damage, LDL oxidation and its attendant negative effects, as well as vascular constriction in mitigating atherosclerosis. <b>Oil</b> palm vegetation <b>liquor</b> thu...|$|R
