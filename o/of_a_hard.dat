5|$|BitLocker is {{a logical}} volume {{encryption}} system. (A volume spans part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> disk drive, the whole drive or more than one drive.) When enabled, TPM and BitLocker can ensure {{the integrity of the}} trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS and boot sector), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector malware.|$|E
5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E

5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly {{wiped out the}} falls. The geological formation of the area consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls. The falls were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500. Possibly {{as a result of the}} bonding needed to rehabilitate the falls, the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on April 9, 1872.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{formation of the}} area consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> thin layer of Platteville Formation, a limestone, overlaying the soft St. Peter Sandstone sub-surface.

25|$|The {{terraces}} of the Trabancos River only {{occur on}} the left hand side of the valley. Their sediments overlie Miocene sediments. This is the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> slope in the opposite margin, where the terrain is heavily eroded, which renders the formation and maintenance of river terraces impossible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soundboard}} {{is often}} made of spruce or cedar wood, while {{the body is}} usually made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> wood such as maple or walnut. This is a practice consonant {{with the construction of}} other (round-backed) lutes.|$|R

25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} reacts at 400°C with freon-12 to form chlorine, phosgene, {{carbon dioxide}} and uranium tetrafluoride. The freon-12 can be replaced with freon-11 which forms carbon tetrachloride instead of carbon dioxide. This is a case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> perhalogenated freon which is normally considered to be inert being converted chemically at a moderate temperature.|$|E
25|$|St. Anthony Falls {{are made}} up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{limestone}} cap over soft sandstone. 10,000 years ago the falls were located near present-day Fort Snelling, Minnesota {{at the mouth of}} the glacial River Warren. In the succeeding millennia, the river had been washing away the sandstone and undermining the limestone lip of St. Anthony Falls, causing the falls to slowly retreat upriver near its present location.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{typically}} host {{to a hundred}} trillion micro-organisms in ten thousand species in the human microbiome which can't be removed while preserving {{the life of the}} human. Containment seems the only option, but effective containment to the same standard as a robotic rover appears difficult to achieve with present-day technology. In particular, adequate containment in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> landing is a major challenge.|$|E

25|$|My {{painting}} {{does not}} come from the easel. I prefer to tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> disk drive, {{as reported}} by an operating system to the end user, is smaller than the amount stated by the manufacturer, which has several reasons: the operating system using some space, use of some space for data redundancy, and space use for file system structures. The difference in capacity reported in SI decimal prefixed units vs. binary prefixes {{can lead to a}} false impression of missing capacity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} game, Zack Greinke allowed two solo homers {{in the second}} but went seven innings with only the two runs. The Dodgers came from behind with four runs in the seventh {{to win the game}} 5–2 and even the series up. Chase Utley was {{suspended}} for games three and four of the series as a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> slide he performed in game two that led to a season-ending injury for Mets shortstop Rubén Tejada.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "monadnock" [...] {{has come}} to be used by American geologists to {{describe}} any isolated mountain formed from the exposure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> rock as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the erosion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> softer rock that once surrounded it (a landform termed [...] "inselberg" [...] elsewhere in the world).|$|R

25|$|The rugged, {{low-power}} computers use {{flash memory}} instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> drive, run a Fedora-based operating system {{and use the}} SugarLabs Sugar user interface. Mobile ad hoc networking based on the 802.11s wireless mesh network protocol allows students to collaborate on activities and to share Internet access from one connection. The wireless networking has much greater range than typical consumer laptops. The XO-1 has also been designed to be lower cost and much longer-lived than typical laptops.|$|E
25|$|The miners took {{to these}} devices without {{hesitation}} as their pay was not calculated {{until they had}} reached their underground workplace. Contemporary safety studies concluded that, although intrinsically dangerous, {{the use of a}} man engine was in practice safer than climbing long ladders: it was less risky to be carried up at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> shift than to climb a ladder and risk falling because of exhaustion. In some mines, particularly in Germany, wedges or collars placed just above close-fitting rollers, or chains, were installed to limit any drop should a breakage occur.|$|E
25|$|Balanced Rock and Copperas Rocks are two {{examples}} {{of the effects of}} erosion that can be seen by visitors to Trough Creek State Park. Balanced Rock is perched atop a cliff alongside Great Trough Creek. It appears as if it could tumble into the creek below with the slightest push, but it has held the same position for thousands of years. Balanced Rock is made up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> type of rock that did not erode like the rock surrounding it. As the mountains eroded away Balanced Rock remained.|$|E
5000|$|Ceration is a {{chemical}} process, {{a common practice}} in alchemy. Pseudo-Geber's Summa Perfectionis explains that ceration is [...] "the mollification <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hard</b> thing, not fusible unto liquefaction", and {{stresses the importance of}} correct humidity in the process. [...] Ceration is performed by continuously adding a liquid by imbibition to <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> dry substance while it is heated. Typically, this treatment makes the substance softer, more like molten wax (cera in Latin).|$|R
50|$|The Aura HD {{shipped in}} three colours: espresso, ivory, and onyx. It was made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new material; whereas {{previous}} Kobo eReaders used a soft touch matte plastic, the Aura HD's body was made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder,</b> shinier, plastic. This was accompanied with an angular back design, resembling crumpled pages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical book, used for added grip.|$|R
50|$|Upon Alfonso's {{death in}} 910, the kingdom was divided between his three sons; León went to García, Galicia to Ordoño, and Asturias to Fruela. Asturian primacy was {{nevertheless}} recognised, though Ordoño was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> temperament than his brothers. Upon García's death in Zamora in 914, Ordoño succeeded {{him to the}} throne of the León.|$|R
