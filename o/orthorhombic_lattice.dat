The PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge or vice versa by controlled heating and cooling. The tetragonal form is usually red or orange color, while the orthorhombic is usually yellow or orange, but the color is not a very reliable indicator of the structure. The tetragonal and orthorhombic forms of PbO occur naturally as rare minerals.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} conjectures on the {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) Ising model on simple <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>lattices,</b> {{together with the}} details of calculations for a putative exact solution. Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-up dimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed {{to serve as a}} boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3 D Ising model. The partition function of the 3 D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluated by spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity of the conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple <b>orthorhombic</b> Ising <b>lattices</b> could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' or sinh 2 K sinh 2 (K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, the critical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratio xc = exp(- 2 Kc) = (sq(5) - 1) / 2, as derived from K* = 3 K or sinh 2 K sinh 6 K = 1. If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombic Ising system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of the phase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlation functions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly. The putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple <b>orthorhombic</b> Ising <b>lattices</b> are alpha = 0, beta = 3 / 8, gamma = 5 / 4, delta = 13 / 3, eta = 1 / 8 and nu = 2 / 3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scaling laws. The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and the results obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of the approximation methods and the experimental findings. The 3 D to 2 D crossover phenomenon differs with the 2 D to 1 D crossover phenomenon and there is a gradual crossover of the exponents from the 3 D values to the 2 D ones.

40|$|AbstractThe {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the skin, the stratum corneum, consists of corneocytes surrounded by lipid domains. The main lipid classes in stratum corneum are cholesterol, ceramides (CER), and free fatty acids forming two crystalline lamellar phases. However, only limited information is available on whether the various lipid classes participate in the same crystalline lattices or if separate domains are formed within the lipid lamellae. In this article infrared spectroscopic studies are reported of hydrated mixtures prepared from cholesterol, human CER, and free fatty acids. Evaluation of the methylene stretching vibrations revealed a conformational disordering starting at ∼ 60 °C for all mixtures. Examination of the rotational ordering (scissoring and rocking vibrations) of mixtures prepared from equimolar cholesterol and CER with {{a variation in the}} level of free fatty acids showed that at lower free fatty acid content orthorhombic and hexagonal domains coexist in the lipid lamellae. Increasing the fatty acid level to an equimolar cholesterol/CER/fatty acid mixture reveals the dominant presence of an <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>lattice,</b> confirming x-ray diffraction studies. Replacing the protonated free fatty acid chains by their perdeuterated counterparts demonstrates that free fatty acids and CER participate in the same <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>lattice</b> up to a level of slightly less than 1 : 1 : 0. 75 cholesterol/CER/free fatty acids molar ratio but that free fatty acids also form separate domains within the lipid lamellae at equimolar ratios at room temperature. However, no evidence for this has been observed at 32 °C. Extrapolating these findings to the situation in stratum corneum led us conclude that in stratum corneum, fatty acids and CER participate in the <b>orthorhombic</b> <b>lattice</b> at 32 °C, the skin temperature...|$|E

A first way to reduce dimension is by considering layered lattices, and minimize either among competitors presenting different sequences of repetitions of the layers, or among competitors presenting different shifts of the layers with respect to each other. The second case presents the problem of minimizing theta functions also on translated lattices, namely minimizing (L,u) θ_L+u(α). Another way to reduce dimension is by considering lattices with a product structure or by successively minimizing over concentric layers.

The transport properties at the underdoped level $x= 0. 05 $ exhibit pronounced anomalies at about the same temperature where undoped LaFeAsO develops long-range nematic ordering, i. e. at about 160 K.
