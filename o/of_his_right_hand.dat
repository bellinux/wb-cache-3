5|$|A {{comparable}} chamber {{work for}} an even more unusual set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba, was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> during World War I. After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from {{the view of the}} bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; the fingers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E

5|$|Petry's wounds {{resulted}} {{in his right}} arm having to be amputated below the elbow. He was evacuated to an American hospital in Germany, where he spent several weeks in recovery before being transferred to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center in Fort Hood, Texas. He now uses an advanced prosthetic in place <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> On the prosthetic is a small plaque listing {{the names of the}} fallen Rangers of his regiment. After recovering, Petry did not seek a medical discharge; instead, he deployed to Afghanistan between recovering and receiving the Medal of Honor. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

After releasing Fused, he joined Heaven & Hell, which disbanded after Ronnie James Dio's death in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The last {{decorative}} {{aspect of}} this structure is the pectoral, {{made up of a}} circular plate superposed to a semi rectangular plate; possibly it represents a shell, jade and obsidian mosaic.

50|$|Kotofuji was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring a hidari-yotsu, (<b>right</b> <b>hand</b> outside, {{left hand}} inside) {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, a {{straightforward}} force out, which accounted for half his victories at sekitori level, {{but he was also}} fond <b>of</b> using <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> grip to win by uwatenage, or overarm throw. <b>His</b> height <b>of</b> 192 cm made him amongst the tallest wrestlers but <b>his</b> weight <b>of</b> 145 kg was not much more than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> competitors.|$|R
25|$|Ezekiel House left Owego in {{the spring}} of 1854 as he had taken a {{contract}} to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> severed by a chisel which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated his doing any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an automatic gate.|$|E
25|$|Confession {{does not}} {{take place in a}} confessional, but {{normally}} in {{the main part of the}} church itself, usually before an analogion (lectern) set up near the iconostasion. On the analogion is placed a Gospel Book and a blessing cross. The confession often takes place before an icon of Jesus Christ. Orthodox understand that the confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ, and the priest stands only as witness and guide. Before confessing, the penitent venerates the Gospel Book and cross, and places the thumb and first two fingers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> on the feet of Christ as he is depicted on the cross. The confessor will often read an admonition warning the penitent to make a full confession, holding nothing back.|$|E
25|$|Biron thereupon forced Anne {{to order}} {{an inquiry into}} Volynsky's past career, {{with the result that}} he was tried before a {{tribunal}} of Biron's men. The charges faced were that he, as a minister, and Andrey Khrushchyov (1691—1740), as an assistant minister, tried to dethrone Queen Anna for Peter the Great's daughter, Elizabeth. He was arrested on June 23, 1740 and thus condemned to be broken on the wheel and then beheaded. On the scaffold, by the clemency of the empress, his punishment was mitigated to the severing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> followed by decapitation on June 27, 1740. The sentence was executed exactly 31 years after the Battle of Poltava. Volynsky had by his side architect Pyotr Yeropkin and Andrey Khrushchyov.|$|E
