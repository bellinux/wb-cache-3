5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> a {{wide range}} of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It {{is also one of the}} few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E

5|$|The {{city also}} has festivals {{representing}} its cultural heritage. Twice each year, {{there is a}} Tejikara Fire Festival. It first <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> the second Saturday of April at Tejikarao Shrine and it again <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> the second Sunday of August at Nagara River Park. Half-naked men ring bells, and carry shrines and other devices that shoot off large sparks. Near the end of August, the city sponsors Takigi Noh, a traditional form of Japanese theater that takes place {{on the banks of}} the Nagara River, lit only by the surrounding bonfires and the fires of cormorant boats.|$|E
5|$|Twice a year, Gifu plays hosts to {{two large}} {{fireworks}} festivals.

5|$|Banksia speciosa <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> {{coastal dunes}} and sandplains in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia, from East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the {{vicinity}} of Hopetoun eastwards to Israelite Bay, generally within 50km (31mi) of the coast.

5|$|Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary (36° S) in {{southern}} New South Wales northwards {{along the coast}} and Great Dividing Range {{to the tip of}} Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Outside Australia it <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda. Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> sandstone or latite soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical rainforest. Large specimens can rise above the canopy as emergent trees.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E

5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage {{and to protect}} against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|E
5|$|In the Upper Myall River region, B.serrata {{grows in}} dry sclerophyll forest on sandy soils that have {{recently}} formed (in the Holocene) or in shallow soils over differing substrates, while its close relative B.aemula grows on dry heath forest that <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> ancient Pleistocene sands {{that have not}} been disturbed in 125,000 years. In intermediate communities both species are found.|$|E
5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> {{a uniform}} surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, where no adatom traps or sources are present. This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy, wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses. Even {{in the case of}} a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non-uniformity near the edges of the terrace.|$|E

5|$|Lutetium <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> the Earth {{in form of}} two isotopes: lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. Out {{of these}} two, only the former is stable, making the element monoisotopic. The latter one, lutetium-176, decays via beta decay with a {{half-life}} of 3.781010 years; it makes up about 2.5% of natural lutetium.|$|E
5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms {{of muscles}} {{in either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Sphenodon punctatus {{naturally}} <b>occurs</b> <b>on</b> 29 islands, and {{its population}} {{is estimated to}} be over 60,000individuals.

The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of antheridia and archegonia {{on an individual}} bryophyte plant is usually constant within a species, although in some species it may depend on environmental conditions. The main division is between species in which the antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the same plant and those in which they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different plants. The term monoicous may be used where antheridia and archegonia <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> the same gametophyte and the term dioicous where they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> different gametophytes.|$|R
