40|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} a calibration model, {{techniques such as}} piecewise direct standardization (PDS) or direct standardization (DS) are used. This implies that the same subset of samples must be measured in both situations. However, when a model is transferred from an <b>off-line</b> <b>application</b> to an on-line application, {{it is not possible}} to remeasure the same subset of samples. In this paper, however, a method is presented which can transfer a multivariate calibration model from an <b>off-line</b> <b>application</b> to an on-line application without remeasuring the same subset. For this purpose a calibration model has been calculated with a subset of spectral variables. The variables, which are sensitive to the differences between the off-line and the on-line application, are rejected. The method is compared with the calculation of a hybrid calibration model in which off-line and on-line spectral data are combined into one calibration set. The methods are applied to a calibration model which is used to predict the shrinkage after heat treatment of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) yarns from the Raman spectra measured both off-line and on-line. The Raman spectra of a calibration set have been measured off-line and a smaller set has been measured on-line during the production of PET yarns. It has been found that it is possible to make a universal calibration model for off-line and on-line predictions of PET yarn shrinkage by Raman spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In the past, {{the process}} {{capability}} index (PCI) {{was the only one}} used in on-line quality management; there were no researches on off-line applications, such as product design or process planning. In using conventional PCI for <b>off-line</b> <b>application,</b> designers normally established the process mean close to the design target, and minimized the process variance so that the PCI value would be maximized. The process variance is determined by the process tolerance, which affects the production cost. This factor must be considered because cost will increase as process tolerance is minimized. Simply averting small tolerance for the sake of cost reduction is not always a rational choice, because a great tolerance value generally results in poor quality. Hence, the conventional PCI value does not truly represent the measurement score for off-line applications during product design or process planning. In this regard, the off-line PCI expression is developed with consideration of the balance between product quality and production cost. The product quality is represented by quality loss function, and production cost is expressed by tolerance cost function. These two functions are simultaneously related to process mean and process tolerance. Thus, the new PCI expression can be used to determine appropriate process mean and process tolerance, as well as a measurement score for comparison and selection among candidates. Consequently, an economical and quality of product design and process planning can be achieved during off-line applications.

40|$|The basic {{inference}} {{problem is}} defined as follows: For a finite set X equals left brace x// 1,...,x//n right brace, we wish to infer properties of elements of X {{on the basis of}} sets of 'queries' regarding subsets of X. By restricting these queries to statistical queries, the statistical database (SDB) security problem is obtained. The security problem for the SDB is to limit the use of the SDB so that only statistical information is available and no sequence of queries is sufficient to infer protected information about any individual. When such information is obtained the SDB is said to be compromised. In this paper, two applications concerning the security of the SDB are considered: (1) On-line application. The queries are answered one by one in sequence and it is necessary to determine whether the SDB is compromised if a new query is answered.

40|$|Despite {{the ever}} {{increasing}} computing power, dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) estimation in congested networks remains troublesome. In previous research, {{we have shown}} that an unbiased estimation requires the calculation of {{the sensitivity of the}} link flows to all Origin Destination flows, in order to incorporate the effects of congestion spillback. This is however computationally infeasible for large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a hierarchical approach for <b>off-line</b> <b>application</b> that decomposes the dynamic OD estimation procedure in space. The main idea is to perform a more accurate dynamic OD estimation only on subareas where there is congestion spillback. The output of this estimation is then used as input for the OD estimation on the whole network. This hierarchical approach solves many practical and theoretical limitations of traditional OD estimation methods. The main advantage is that different OD estimation method can be used for different parts of the network as necessary. This allows applying more advanced and accurate, but more time consuming methods only where necessary. The hierarchical approach is tested on a study network and on a real network. In both cases the proposed methodology performs better than traditional OD estimation approaches, indicating its merit. status: publishe...|$|E
