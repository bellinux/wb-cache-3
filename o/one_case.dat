50|$|If a {{particular}} {{dose of radiation}} is found to produce <b>one</b> extra <b>case</b> of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, LNT projects that one thousandth of this dose will produce <b>one</b> extra <b>case</b> in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of the original dose will produce <b>one</b> extra <b>case</b> in every billion people exposed. The conclusion is that any given dose equivalent of radiation will produce {{the same number of}} cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread.|$|R

In each case he sandblasted and cut the optical disc, draping, and in <b>one</b> <b>case</b> piercing, the disc with fluid, cased glass forms. These were followed, in 1978, by Littleton’s Solid Geometry series, in which heavy cased glass forms were cut into trapezoidal, spheroid and ovoid shapes and highly polished.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis may be {{confused}} with the edible brown oyster mushroom (Pleurotus australis), which is brown and does not glow in the dark.

5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together.

5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least <b>one</b> <b>case</b> such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

In <b>one</b> <b>case</b> the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
