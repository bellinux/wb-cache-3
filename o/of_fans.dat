5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> and in-game money for his or her performance. The number <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E

40|$|The WD-repeat protein factor {{associated}} with nSMase activity (FAN) {{is a member}} of the family of TNF receptor adaptor proteins that are coupled to specific signaling cascades. However, the precise functional involvement <b>of</b> <b>FAN</b> in specific cellular TNF responses remain unclear. Here, we report the involvement <b>of</b> <b>FAN</b> in TNF-induced actin reorganization and filopodia formation mediated by activation of Cdc 42. The pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain <b>of</b> <b>FAN</b> specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdIns(4, 5) P), which targets FAN to the plasma membrane. Site-specific mutagenesis revealed that the ability <b>of</b> <b>FAN</b> to mediate filopodia formation was blunted either by the destruction of the PtdIns(4, 5) P binding motif, or by the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the PH domain and the adjacent beige and Chediak-Higashi (BEACH) domain. Furthermore, FAN was shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton in TNF-stimulated cells via direct filamentous actin (F-actin) binding. The results of this study suggest that PH-mediated plasma membrane targeting <b>of</b> <b>FAN</b> is critically involved in TNF-induced Cdc 42 activation and cytoskeleton reorganization...|$|R
