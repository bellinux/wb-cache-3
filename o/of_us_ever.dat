500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on his tongue and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>ever</b> hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczyński, Raczyński and General Sikorski met {{privately with}} Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, {{and told them}} that the Poles had {{concrete}} proof that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczyński reports that Churchill, [...] "without committing himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it". Churchill said that [...] "The Bolsheviks can be very cruel". However, at the same time, on 24 April 1943, Churchill assured the Soviets: [...] "We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded that Soviet guilt was a [...] "near certainty", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: [...] "All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>ever</b> speak a word about it." [...] O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight. In his memoirs, he refers to the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which found the Germans responsible, and adds, [...] "belief seems an act of faith".|$|E

And I do not know, nor will any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>ever</b> really know, what kind of strength it was that enabled him to make so dogged and splendid a journey." ...|$|E

Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked {{to the middle of}} the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. [...] A week later, they were married.
