50|$|Sunset Yellow FCF (also {{known as}} <b>Orange</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>S,</b> or C.I. 15985) is a petroleum-derived orange azo dye with a pH {{dependent}} maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm.

40|$|Abstract The goal of {{the present}} {{contribution}} was {{the development of a}} liquid chromatographic method for the determination of water soluble synthetic pigments in soft drinks. The method consists in the direct injection of the sample (after filtration) in a HPLC system with diode array detection on a reverse phase column. The HPLC method was validated by specific performance criteria, such as the linearity of the calibration curve, recovery percentage and estimation of the measurement uncertainty. The results obtained for the determination of two of the most used synthetic colorants, FD&C Yellow 5 and <b>Orange</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>S</b> on real soft drink samples demonstrated that the described HPLC method is a useful technique for analyzing synthetic dyes, rapid and simple, with an appropriate uncertainty of the measurements...|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the puzzle is to {{scramble}} the colors, and then restore it to its original state of having one color per circle. This puzzle is equivalent to solving just the corners of a Megaminx. The original Impossiball had the same colors as the Rubik's Cube: red, <b>orange,</b> <b>yellow,</b> green, blue and white. Meffert currently produces two versions, one with six colors and one with twelve. The six-color version (pictured) uses pink, two shades of <b>orange,</b> <b>yellow,</b> green and blue. All the pieces are still distinguishable, however, because the two pieces with the same three colors are mirror images of each other. The twelve-color version has red, pink, <b>orange,</b> <b>yellow,</b> two shades of green, three shades of blue, purple, brown and white.|$|R
50|$|Female. Upperside dark {{chocolate}} brown without the impressed streak; cilia of hindwing pale <b>orange</b> <b>yellow.</b> Underside bright ferruginous brown.|$|R
