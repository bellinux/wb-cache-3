25|$|In 2012, the Canadian export {{pipeline}} system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space {{by reducing the}} monthly allocation of each shipper to {{a certain percentage of}} its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were <b>outbidding</b> it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota tight oil production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.|$|E
25|$|Other {{airlines}} and tour operators {{were quick to}} jump on the burgeoning package holiday bandwagon. This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick's management, Shipping Industrial Holdings subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers — almost 1968's whole industry total — and contracted over 70% of Court Line's charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and <b>outbidding</b> them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain. Thus, in the early 1970s, a holiday in Majorca or on the Costa del Sol became affordable for the average person for the first time.|$|E
25|$|To counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends {{that any}} harsh things she says or does are {{actually}} kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing {{he is the}} only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the ceremony Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily <b>outbidding</b> Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio actually possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e. Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing Lucentio's remaining rival.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Ford {{partnered with}} the South Korean company Hyundai, {{and at the}} new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai {{introduced}} their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988–1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994–1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, <b>outbidding</b> Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. After subsequent divestments, Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.|$|E

She was bought by Lord Marcus Beresford {{on behalf of the}} financier Baron Maurice de Hirsch for a sum of 5,500 guineas, <b>outbidding</b> the Duke of Portland and John Porter and breaking the record for a yearling sold at auction, which had stood since 1876.|$|E

[...] In 2015 Page successfully challenged a planning application lodged by the pop star Robbie Williams, who had purchased the adjacent Woodland House in 2013 and planned extensive renovations. Page argued that the alterations, particularly the intended underground excavations, would threaten the structure of the Tower House.|$|E

500|$|Ball did {{not expect}} to sell the script, believing it would act as more of a calling card, but American Beauty drew {{interest}} from several production bodies. Cannava passed the script to several producers, including Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen, who took it to DreamWorks. With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper, and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner, Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks; he received assurances from the studio—known at the time for its more conventional fare—that it would not [...] "iron the [...] out". In an unusual move, DreamWorks decided not to option the script; instead, in April 1998, the studio bought it outright for $250,000, <b>outbidding</b> Fox Searchlight Pictures, October Films, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Lakeshore Entertainment. DreamWorks planned to make the film for $6–8million.|$|E
500|$|Zayat {{returned}} to Egypt in 1995 and formed an investment group, which purchased the Al-Ahram Beverages Company in 1997, <b>outbidding</b> Anheuser-Busch and Heineken International. Al-Ahram had been {{owned by the}} Egyptian government and Zayat had helped find American investors to take over government-owned businesses that had been nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser back in the 1950s. The original beer product was of poor quality, mocked as being able to [...] "power heavy machinery {{if there was no}} diesel fuel available." [...] Under Zayat's leadership, additional brands of beer were introduced, and he developed a non-alcoholic beer, Fayrouz, designed specifically for the Muslim market. The company was modernized from a run-down operation to a publicly traded business that sold in 2002 to Heineken International for $280 million, more than three times its pre-acquisition valuation, in what was then the largest corporate buyout in Egyptian history.|$|E
500|$|Ball {{began writing}} American Beauty as a {{play in the}} early 1990s, partly {{inspired}} by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting {{to break into the}} film industry. The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks; the then-fledgling film studio bought Ball's script for $250,000, <b>outbidding</b> several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15million production and served as its North American distributor. American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver! and Cabaret, Mendes was, nevertheless, only given the job after 20 others were considered and several [...] "A-list" [...] directors turned down the opportunity.|$|E

If a deal could not be reached, Matsuzaka would have returned to the Lions, nullifying the bid.
