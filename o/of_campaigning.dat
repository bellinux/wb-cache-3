5|$|In {{response}} to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the thematic system established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several themata, which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a stratēgos, each thema maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by thematic forces, under Constantine V the larger early themes were progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the tagmata, was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that henceforth formed the core <b>of</b> <b>campaigning</b> armies.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Komnenian period in 1081, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent in its history. Surrounded by enemies, and financially ruined by a long period of civil war, the empire's prospects had looked grim. Yet, through a combination of determination, military reform, and years <b>of</b> <b>campaigning,</b> Alexios I Komnenos, John II Komnenos and Manuel I Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire. An important factor in the success of the Komnenoi was their establishment of a reconstructed Byzantine army. The new military system which they created is known as the Komnenian army. From c. 1081 to c. 1180, the Komnenian army {{played an important role in}} providing the empire with a period of security that enabled Byzantine civilization to flourish.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1967, the 4th Infantry Division's 1st and 2nd Brigades {{conducting}} Operation Francis Marion {{in western}} Kon Tum Province were making heavy contact with PAVN forces. These contacts prompted division commander Lieutenant General William R. Peers to request reinforcement and, as a result, on 17 June, two battalions of Brigadier General John R. Deane's 173rd Airborne Brigade were {{moved into the}} Dak To area to begin sweeping the jungle-covered mountains in Operation Greeley. The 173rd had been operating near Bien Hoa Air Base outside Saigon and had been in combat only against Viet Cong guerrillas. Prior to its deployment to the highlands, Peers' operations officer, Colonel William J. Livsey, attempted to warn the Airborne officers of the hazards <b>of</b> <b>campaigning</b> in the highlands. He also advised them that PAVN regulars were a much better equipped and motivated force than the Viet Cong. These warnings, however, made little impression on the paratroopers, who were about to become victims of their own overconfidence.|$|E
5|$|Labor, {{astonished}} {{that such}} an action was {{to come from a}} Liberal Premier, resolutely supported the bill, guaranteeing it passage through the House of Assembly 29–6, the only dissenters being LCL members. However, the Legislative Council was dominated by economic conservatives, fierce adherents of free enterprise and opponents of what they considered to be undue government intervention in the economy. The LCL councillors tried to have the bill watered down to allow merely for government control of AESC for a brief period. In the Council, where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements, the ALP only held four seats out of twenty, and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation. Thus, on 7 November, the bill failed to pass and it was not put to the Parliament again until 1946. On 6 April, after months <b>of</b> <b>campaigning</b> on Playford's part, he managed to change the mind of MLC Jack Bice, and the bill passed. The Electricity Trust of South Australia was formed, and was to become a major aid to post-war industrialisation.|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{seeks to}} provide a {{theoretical}} framework for conceptualizing this relationship and considering reforms. Part I traces the variation <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance regimes across several political eras and several jurisdictional scales. Strikingly, although similar six-figure campaign finance scandals prompted the reforms of each era, federal lawmakers in each era have drawn progressively lower one-size-fits-all contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Meanwhile, state campaign finance laws have been more carefully calibrated to reflect the electoral and financial circumstances of particular electoral contests. Part II considers the currently permissible means and ends <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance law and how they constrain the calibration of contribution limits and disclosure thresholds. Part III explains how a recalibration <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance laws in some jurisdictions might bring these regulations into alignment with the constitutional justifications for-and policy goals of-our system <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance laws. Recalibration offers an important opportunity for both opponents and proponents of regulation to ensure a better fit between the means and ends <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance law...|$|R

5|$|The {{crossbows}} {{and early}} firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated {{rapidly in the}} field, often becoming unusable {{after a few weeks}} <b>of</b> <b>campaigning</b> due to the effects of the climate. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his reign, John made {{a concerted}} effort to secure Antioch. On the way, he {{captured}} the southern coast of Asia Minor and Cilicia. He advanced into Syria at the head of his veteran army, which had been seasoned by a lifetime <b>of</b> <b>campaigning.</b> Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, there was a famous incident where his allies, Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin II of Edessa, sat around playing dice while John pressed the Siege of Shaizar. These Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign, while Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful. Ultimately, Joscelin and Raymond conspired to keep John out of Antioch, and while he was preparing to lead a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a further campaign, he accidentally grazed his hand on a poison arrow while out hunting. The poison set in and shortly afterwards he died.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line <b>of</b> <b>campaigning</b> was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E
