5|$|In addition, {{the motion}} gear rings {{and the upper}} drive wheel both had 600 teeth, which by Su's {{mathematical}} precision carefully calculated measured units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> a division of 1/600.

5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day.</b> <b>In</b> February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

They reached Greece, where they were nearly trapped by the German {{invasion}} in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but the marriage was not long-lived.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{had eight}} {{legitimate}} children by Eleanor, five sons—William, the Young Henry, Richard, Geoffrey and John, and three daughters, Matilda, Eleanor and Joan. Henry also had several illegitimate children; amongst {{the most prominent}} of these were Geoffrey (later Archbishop of York) and William (later Earl of Salisbury). Henry was expected to provide for the future of his legitimate children, either through granting lands to his sons or marrying his daughters well. Henry's family was divided by rivalries and violent hostilities, more so than many other royal families <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> particular the relatively cohesive French Capetians. Various suggestions have been put forward to explain Henry's family's bitter disputes, from their inherited family genetics to the failure of Henry and Eleanor's parenting. Other theories focus on the personalities of Henry and his children. Historians such as Matthew Strickland have argued that Henry made sensible attempts to manage the tensions within his family, and that, had the King died younger, the succession might have proven much smoother.|$|E
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record {{that many of the}} facts of the case are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, this is the most common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E
5|$|Rossier was in Hong Kong in 1858, and he {{soon began}} taking photographs, mostly {{in and around}} Canton (now Guangzhou). In November 1859 Negretti and Zambra {{published}} a set of fifty of Rossier's views, including stereographs. These received favourable reviews in photographic periodicals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1858 or 1859 Rossier travelled to the Philippines where he visited and photographed the Taal Volcano. Rossier was in Japan by 1859, producing photographs first in Nagasaki, then in Kanagawa, Yokohama and Edo (now Tokyo); {{he was the first}} professional photographer to arrive in Japan. One of the photographs Rossier took during the summer of 1859, while in Nagasaki, was a portrait of Philipp Franz von Siebold's son Alexander and a group of samurai from the Nabeshima clan.|$|E

5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles in shallow water, occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations in shallow water from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be {{taking advantage of the}} warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E
5|$|Tazi also {{competed in}} the slalom on 21 February. After her first run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> one minute and 10.19 seconds, she was in 56th place. She {{recorded}} an improved time of one minute and 6.96 seconds, placing her in 45th place for the second run. This meant her overall time of two minutes and 17.15 seconds placed her in 45th position, just ahead of Tobi (two minutes and 20.45 seconds) but behind Ivana Bulatović of Montenegro (two minutes and 12.8 seconds). Mikaela Shiffrin was the gold medallist in an overall time of one minute and 44.54 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The NWMP was {{commanded}} by {{a relatively small}} team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately one officer to every twenty enlisted men. The officers were usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and were typically Canadian-born; deliberate {{attempts were made to}} reflect the different religious and ethnic groups that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and were typically {{selected on the basis of}} their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.|$|E

30|$|A further {{breakdown}} of within person variability (WPSS) into between-day (systematic day-to-day) and within-day variability {{shows that the}} systematic day-to-day variability (BDSS) has an extremely low share of WPSS (about 5  % for the Monday-Sunday period). The intrapersonal variability in trip numbers can hardly be related to <b>the</b> peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> week (e.g. alternation <b>of</b> <b>days</b> during <b>the</b> working week or during the weekend). This is once {{more in line with}} Pas [25] but one can analyse <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> this share according to the various periods.|$|R
