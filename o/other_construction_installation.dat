50|$|For a {{concrete}} construction of any size, as concrete has a rather low tensile strength, {{it is generally}} strengthened using steel rods or bars (known as rebars). This strengthened concrete is then referred to as reinforced concrete. In order to minimise any air bubbles, that would weaken the structure, a vibrator is used to eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid concrete mix is poured around the ironwork. Concrete has been the predominant building material in the modern age due to its longevity, formability, and ease of transport. Recent advancements, such as insulating concrete forms, combine the concrete forming and <b>other</b> <b>construction</b> steps (<b>installation</b> of insulation). All materials must be taken in required proportions as described in standards.|$|R

30|$|Offshore wind {{parks are}} power plants {{on the sea}} that produce {{electricity}} from renewable source wind. The electricity is generated through wind turbines and converted into electricity {{with the aid of}} transformer platforms and cables. Offshore wind farms are created through complex construction projects, and each location is unique due to different wind, weather and soil conditions (EWEA 2015; WEC 2013). Moreover, the lifetime of offshore wind farms is characterised by different phases that are considered somewhat in isolation in relation to each <b>other,</b> e.g. <b>construction,</b> production, <b>installation</b> and O&M; however, considerable spill-over is present between phases and can therefore be viewed as network systems (Houman et al. 2014; Autio and Thomas 2014).|$|R
