40|$|Resonance {{behavior}} of an imperfect joint of elastic plates {{subjected to the}} incidence of the lowest-order symmetric (S 0) Lamb mode is numerically analyzed in the frequency domain by the hybrid finite element method. To this purpose, the reflection and transmission characteristics of the S 0 mode are calculated for the frequency range in which the S 0 mode is the only symmetric mode that can propagate in the plates. The imperfect joint is modeled as a linear spring-type interface characterized by the normal and tangential stiffnesses. As a result, it is shown that the imperfect joint of plates has two <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> at which the out-of-plane displacement amplitudes at the joint are remarkably increased. <b>One</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> depends only on the normal stiffness, and the other only on the tangential stiffness.

The purpose of this application is to realize ambient sources of kinetic energy such as vibrations, {{and turn them into}} useful electrical energy for powering low powered sensor nodes. The most typical form of piezoelectric {{energy harvesting}} comes from cantilevered bimorphs. These bimorph structures are typically rectangular in shape with a tip mass, resonating in the fundamental mode of vibration. This creates a stress concentration near the fixed end of the cantilever, which linearly decreases towards the free end, hence creating an inefficient system. In order to improve this scenario by achieving a constant axial strain profile through the length of the geometry, tapered cantilevered bimorphs have been proposed in literature. However, an exhaustive set of experimental data and proper characterization, with appropriate constraints such as matching <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> to prove this concept is elusive.

However, for passive monolithically integrated structures, the coupling gap is fixed and cannot be externally controlled, making tuning the coupling inherently challenging. We design a dual-cavity coupled microresonator structure in which tuning <b>one</b> ring <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> induces {{a change in the}} overall cavity coupling condition. We demonstrate wide extinction tunability with high efficiency by engineering the ring coupling conditions.

40|$|A split {{hopper barge}} is a {{dredging}} vessel that can split over its longitudinal axis to discharge its cargo. To allow {{for such an}} operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges {{at the top and}} hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the workability limits of split hopper barges in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated {{to determine the effects of}} roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the split hopper barge. From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a closed split hopper barge and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the workability limits of the split hopper barge is drawn. For the barge carrying a solid cargo only <b>one</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3 -hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the workability limits of the split hopper barge in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo...|$|R
