40|$|In many jurisdictions, {{international}} traders {{can apply}} to customs authorities for an advance ruling for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> before they import or export their goods. The advance ruling system for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is expected to grant more legal certainty to international traders because they can communicate with customs authorities and receive a legally binding <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> decision in advance. Such a system {{is important in the}} facilitation of international trade. In this paper, the advance ruling systems for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in the European Union (EU), China and Taiwan will be compared. It is shown that the advance ruling systems for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in these three jurisdictions all emphasise the efficiency of customs administration more than the legitimate expectation and procedural rights of the applicants. This imbalance might result from the complicated nature of tariff classification; however, it can also make the advance ruling system less attractive for international traders to use...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} customs is {{commonly}} referred to as that of imports and exports. It is perceived as a maze of processes, procedures, and forms required to enable a customs administration to perform their wide range of responsibilities. One of the responsibilities of a customs administration is the collection of duties, which necessitates classification of the goods in question. This study sets out {{to determine the extent of}} customs control in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in South Africa. The starting point is the establishment of the foundations of customs, both internationally and in South Africa. After origin and valuation, <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is the third technical customs-related focus area. An analysis of the responsibilities of the customs administration in South Africa confirms the importance of revenue collection and, subsequently, <b>tariff</b> <b>classification.</b> As a result of South Africa’s membership of the World Customs Organization, specific obligations in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> are incurred. The implementation and application of the international provisions are considered and compared in South Africa, Australia, and Canada. Not only is South Africa’s existing legislation considered, but also two new Acts. It is found that despite similarities in the implementation of the Harmonized System Convention into the legislation of the three countries, South Africa’s existing legislation makes the most detailed provision for the Harmonized System and its aids. This is based on the finding that the legislation in Australia and Canada, as well as the two new Acts in South Africa, do not have the same comprehensive provisions. A critical review of the varying processes of classification in the three countries suggests that more suitable and effective processes could be implemented in South Africa. In addition, a synopsis of some of the principles developed in case law is provided and compared. In relation to facilitation, the access to relevant information and the adequacy thereof, as well as the availability of rulings, are considered. Differences in the approach to dispute resolution in the three countries are furthermore provided. Proposals are made to address the discrepancies in the implementation and application of the legislation, the process of classification, the principles developed in case law, the enhancement of related guides, the publication of <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> rulings, and the extent of facilitation and dispute resolution. Finally it is recommended that an independent and expert tribunal is established to adjudicate technical customs matters. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|Purpose The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a {{behavioural}} {{screening tool}} for children. The SDQ is increasingly {{used as the}} primary outcome measure in population health interventions involving children, {{but it is not}} preference based; therefore, its role in allocative economic evaluation is limited. The Child Health Utility 9 D (CHU 9 D) is a generic preference-based health-related quality of-life measure. This study investigates the applicability of the SDQ outcome measure for use in economic evaluations and examines its relationship with the CHU 9 D by testing previously published mapping algorithms. The aim of the paper is to explore the feasibility of using the SDQ within economic evaluations of school-based population health interventions. Methods Data were available from children participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial of the school-based roots of empathy programme in Northern Ireland. Utility was calculated using the original and alternative CHU 9 D tariffs along with two SDQ mapping algorithms. t tests were performed for pairwise differences in utility values from the preference-based tariffs and mapping algorithms. Results Mean (standard deviation) SDQ total difficulties and prosocial scores were 12 (3. 2) and 8. 3 (2. 1). Utility values obtained from the <b>original</b> <b>tariff,</b> alternative tariff, and mapping algorithms using five and three SDQ subscales were 0. 84 (0. 11), 0. 80 (0. 13), 0. 84 (0. 05), and 0. 83 (0. 04), respectively. Each method for calculating utility produced statistically significantly different values except the <b>original</b> <b>tariff</b> and five SDQ subscale algorithm. Conclusion Initial evidence suggests the SDQ and CHU 9 D are related in some of their measurement properties. The mapping algorithm using five SDQ subscales was found to be optimal in predicting mean child health utility. Future research valuing changes in the SDQ scores would contribute to this research...|$|R

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct preshipment inspections of imports, generating independent data on the value and <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> of incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in import duty collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the import duty improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in import duty collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.

Both assays targeted the same sequence of the uridine 5 ′-monophosphate synthase (UMPS), and their specificities and sensitivities were determined with various plant materials. Both qPCR and LAMP methods were reliable and accurate in the rapid detection of tobacco components in various practical samples, including customs samples, reconstituted tobacco samples, and locally purchased cigarettes, showing high potential for their application in tobacco identification, particularly in the special cases where the morphology or chemical compositions of tobacco have been disrupted.

30|$|Assessing product ‘likeness’ has in {{particular}} {{to take into account}} the products’ respective physical characteristics, end-uses, related consumer tastes and habits and <b>tariff</b> <b>classifications</b> [18]. From the standards established by WTO case law [15] it follows that articles with SVHC and articles without SVHC may often be deemed like products in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT. On the one hand, articles with SVHC frequently pose a certain risk to humans or the environment which is due to the exposure in the product life cycle that is in practice hardly avoidable. Similar products without SVHC do not pose corresponding risks, indicating as a result that the two products are not regarded as like products in terms of their properties, nature and quality. On the other hand, potential end-uses will, except in special cases, be identical for both products in principle. Moreover, data on consumer tastes and habits show that consumers in the EEA do not consistently prefer products without SVHC; rather, relevant market segments are likely to exist in which consumers perceive the compared articles as substitutable [19]. This may result in individual cases where there is evidence in favour of the likeness of the products.|$|R

Econometric results are plausible (they satisfy the revealed preference criterion that estimated costs of RoO should be less than preference rates when utilization rates of NAFTA preference are significantly positive), and they indicate that changes in <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> are more costly for final goods than for intermediate goods. For activities subject to regional value content minima, we carry out illustrative simulations indicating what tariff preference margin would be necessary to compensate for the import content minima.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 900 / 2008 lays down provisions and analysis methods for certain parameters necessary for the determination of the agricultural element. The milk fat content is one of the parameters related to the agricultural element. A problem became apparent when the analysis of an instantised whey protein concentrate (WPC) imported from the USA into the EU revealed that the milk fat contained in the product was much below the expected one. This caused the classification of the product under a different additional code in the “Meursing” table, leading to a disadvantage of the importer.

We address this puzzle {{in the context of}} redistribution towards special interest groups (SIGs) by focusing on a set of important policies: tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government can gain by committing to constrain tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of less efficient NTBs; commitment has political value because it improves the bargaining position of a government that is weak relative to domestic SIGs. Using detailed data we find support for several of the model’s predictions including: (i) tariff commitments in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs but not enough to offset the <b>original</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions; (ii) tariff commitments {{are more likely to be}} adopted and more stringent when the government is weaker relative to a SIG.
