50|$|Estimates of gene <b>overlap</b> in {{bacterial}} genomes typically {{find that}} around {{one third of}} bacterial genes are <b>overlapped,</b> though usually only by a few base pairs. Most studies of <b>overlap</b> in bacterial genomes find evidence that <b>overlap</b> serves a function in gene regulation, permitting the <b>overlapped</b> genes to be transcriptionally and translationally co-regulated. In prokaryotic genomes, unidirectional <b>overlaps</b> are most common, possibly due to the tendency of adjacent prokaryotic genes to share orientation. Among unidirectional <b>overlaps,</b> long <b>overlaps</b> are more commonly read with a one-nucleotide offset in reading frame (i.e., phase 1) and short <b>overlaps</b> are more commonly read in phase 2. Long <b>overlaps</b> of greater than 60 base pairs are more common for convergent genes; however, putative long <b>overlaps</b> have very high rates of misannotation. Robustly validated examples of long <b>overlaps</b> in bacterial genomes are rare; in the well-studied model organism Escherichia coli, only four gene pairs are well validated as having long, overprinted <b>overlaps.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of cloud <b>overlap</b> based on high temporal and vertical resolution retrievals of cloud condensate from {{a suite of}} ground instruments is performed at a mid-latitude atmospheric observation facility. Two facets of <b>overlap</b> are investigated: cloud fraction <b>overlap,</b> {{expressed in terms of}} a parameter " α " indicating the relative contributions of maximum and random <b>overlap,</b> and <b>overlap</b> of horizontal distributions of condensate, expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient of condensate ranks. The degree of proximity to the random and maximum <b>overlap</b> assumptions is also expressed in terms of a decorrelation length, a convenient scalar parameter for <b>overlap</b> parameters assumed to decay exponentially with separation distance. Both cloud fraction <b>overlap</b> and condensate <b>overlap</b> show significant seasonal variations with a clear tendency for more maximum <b>overlap</b> in the summer months. More maximum <b>overlap</b> is also generally observed when the domain size used to define cloud fractions increases. These tendencies also exist for rank correlations, but are significantly weaker. Hitherto unexplored <b>overlap</b> parameter dependencies are investigated by analyzing mean parameter differences at fixed separation distance within different layers of the atmospheric column, and by searching for possible systematic relationships between alpha and rank correlation. We find that for the same separation distance the <b>overlap</b> parameters are significantly distinct in different atmospheric layers, and that random cloud fraction <b>overlap</b> is usually associated with more randomly <b>overlapped</b> condensate ranks...|$|R

Compared to terrestrial carnivores, relatively {{little is known about}} the factors influencing conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> in snakes, although across snake taxa there appears to be substantial variation in conspecific spatial <b>overlap.</b> In this study, we described conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> of eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon couperi) in peninsular Florida and examined how conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> varied by sex and season (breeding season vs. non-breeding season). We calculated multiple indices of spatial <b>overlap</b> using 6 - and 3 -month utilization distributions (UD) of dyads of simultaneously adjacent telemetered snakes. We also measured conspecific UD density values at each telemetry fix and modeled the distribution of those values as a function of <b>overlap</b> type, sex, and season using generalized Pareto distributions. Home range <b>overlap</b> between males and females was significantly greater than <b>overlap</b> between individuals of the same sex and male home ranges often completely contained female home ranges. Male home ranges <b>overlapped</b> little during both seasons, whereas females had higher levels of <b>overlap</b> during the non-breeding season. The spatial patterns observed in our study are consistent with those seen in many mammalian carnivores, in which low male-male <b>overlap</b> and high inter-sexual <b>overlap</b> provides males with greater access to females. We encourage additional research on the influence of prey availability on conspecific spatial <b>overlap</b> in snakes as well as the behavioral mechanisms responsible for maintaining the low levels of <b>overlap</b> we observed...|$|R
40|$|Audio event classification, as an {{important}} part of Computational Auditory Scene Analysis, has attracted much attention. Currently, the classification technology is mature enough to classify isolated audio events accurately, but for <b>overlapped</b> audio events, it performs much worse. While in real life, most audio documents would have certain percentage of <b>overlaps,</b> and so the <b>overlap</b> classification problem is {{an important}} part of audio classification. Nowadays, the work on <b>overlapped</b> audio event classification is still scarce, and most existing <b>overlap</b> classification systems can only recognize one audio event for an <b>overlap.</b> In this paper, in order to deal with <b>overlaps,</b> we innovatively introduce the author-topic (AT) model which was first proposed for text analysis into audio classification, and innovatively combine it with PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis). We propose 4 systems, i. e.

40|$|Abstract. We analyze speaker <b>overlap</b> in multiparty {{meetings}} both {{in terms}} of automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance, and in terms of distribution of <b>overlap</b> with respect to various factors (collection site, speakers, dialog acts, and hot spots). Unlike most previous work on <b>overlap</b> or crosstalk, our ASR error analysis uses an approach that allows comparison of the same foreground speech with and without naturally occurring <b>overlap,</b> using a state-of-the-art meeting recognition system. We examine 101 meetings. For analysis of ASR, we use 26 meetings from the NIST meeting transcription evaluations, and discover a number of interesting phenomena. First, <b>overlaps</b> tend to occur at high-perplexity regions in the foreground talker’s speech. Second, <b>overlap</b> regions tend to have higher perplexity than those in nonoverlaps, if trigrams or 4 -grams are used, but unigram perplexity within <b>overlaps</b> is considerably lower than that of nonoverlaps. Third, word error rate (WER) after <b>overlaps</b> is consistently lower than that before the <b>overlap,</b> apparently because the foreground speaker reduces perplexity shortly after being <b>overlapped.</b> These appear to be robust findings, because they hold in general across meetings from different collection sites, even though meeting style and absolute rates of <b>overlap</b> vary by site. Further analyses of <b>overlap</b> with respect to speakers and meeting content were conducted on a set of 75 additional meetings collected and annotated at ICSI. These analyses reveal interesting relationships between <b>overlap</b> and dialog acts, as well as between <b>overlap</b> and “hot spots ” (points of increased participant involvement). Finally, results from this larger data set show that individual speakers have widely varying rates of being <b>overlapped.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Microtubule {{organization}} in cells {{is an important}} process. An example of careful microtubule organization is the mitotic spindle. The spindle is a bipolar structure with microtubules emanating from the poles at both sides. These microtubules form antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> in {{the centre of the}} spindle where they are bundled by bundling proteins. The <b>overlaps</b> are centred in the spindle and their constant length is regulated. The <b>overlaps</b> are important for the stability of the microtubule network, without bundling proteins the <b>overlaps</b> are lost and the spindle collapses. The antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> are also the site where microtubules slide apart to induce spindle elongation. Sliding is induced by tetrameric motor proteins that can bind to two bundled microtubules. Spindle elongation also requires microtubule growth at the <b>overlaps.</b> All these different functions at the <b>overlap,</b> sliding, growth/shrinkage and bundling, have to cooperate to maintain <b>overlap</b> length. While sliding reduces <b>overlap</b> length, growth will increase <b>overlap</b> length. These activities have to be coordinated for the maintenance of a constant <b>overlap</b> length. We propose that a feedback mechanism is present where growth of the microtubules is limiting the sliding in the <b>overlap.</b> This would prevent sliding when the <b>overlap</b> decreases and helps to maintain the <b>overlap.</b> We designed in vitro experiments to make antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> in vitro. In these experiments we use purified proteins from S. pombe. We combine ase 1 and klp 9 in a relative sliding assay to mimic the sliding in the midzone. In our experiments we combine relative sliding with dynamic microtubules for the first time. This allows us to test how these activities are coordinated. In other experiments we combine ase 1 and cls 1 with dynamic microtubules to see if the rescue activity of cls 1 can be confined to the <b>overlaps.</b> Furthermore, interactions between motor proteins and diffusive proteins are investigated on single microtubules. </p...|$|R
