25|$|Shock is {{a complex}} {{condition}} which leads to critically decreased perfusion. The usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume, pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart and/or low effective heart pumping. Low arterial pressure, especially low pulse pressure, is a sign <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> contributes to and reflects decreased perfusion.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to study quantitatively the effects on {{macroeconomics}} due to different shocks. The interactions between different shocks are the major subjects. Furthermore, the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>shocks,</b> i. e, the time evolutions <b>of</b> <b>shocks,</b> <b>and</b> the propagation <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> {{are studied in detail}} by using the quantitative models. The approach of this paper can be applied to any economic shocks, particularly, price shocks, technology <b>shocks,</b> unemployment <b>shocks,</b> <b>and</b> outer capital flow shocks. As an example, we investigate the interaction <b>of</b> price <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> exchange rate <b>shock.</b> At the same time, we also discuss the macroeconomic policy’s effects on economic business cycle...|$|R

In Enugu, thousands of corpses and maimed and half dead, deprived, devastated and homeless refugees were pouring in from Northern Nigeria, without any hope of accommodation or food and nourishment. Things even soon got so agonising as civil war eventually broke out between Nigeria and Biafra.|$|E

Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state <b>of</b> <b>shock,</b> <b>and</b> that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

Many of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, directly into the brain in an attempt to render a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. On at least three occasions, this proved fatal although on none of these occasions was this Dahmer's intention.|$|E

25|$|Sakuraba's {{victory over}} Royler {{constituted}} the first loss by a Gracie in professional fighting in several decades and as such, sent ripples <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> controversy through the mixed martial arts community. Some protested that the victory was tainted {{due to the}} fact that Royler (although placed in a debilitating submission hold) never conceded defeat and was little time away from the final bell when the bout was stopped. It is worth noting that the last Japanese athlete to defeat a Gracie prior to Sakuraba's win against Royler, legendary judoka Masahiko Kimura, had used the very same technique Sakuraba utilized to beat Royler. That time, the recipient had been Royler's father, Hélio Gracie, who had, like Royler, also refused to submit but likewise lost.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated {{that it is hard}} to {{describe}} the national sense <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E

25|$|On 2 April 1930, {{two days}} after Ras Gugsa Welle was killed in battle, Empress Zewditu died. It is known today that Zewditu {{suffered}} from diabetes, and was seriously ill with typhoid, {{but it is not}} universally agreed that this was the cause of her death. According to some popular histories, Zewditu died <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> grief at hearing of her husband's death, but other accounts contradict this, claiming that Zewditu was not informed of the battle's outcome before her sudden death. Some diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa reported {{at the time that the}} fever-stricken Empress was immersed in a large container of frigidly cold holy water to cure her of her illness, but that her body went into shock and she died shortly thereafter. The timing of her death immediately after news of the outcome of the battle reached Addis Ababa has caused considerable speculation as to her cause of death. Some, particularly conservative critics of her successor, Emperor Haile Selassie, allege that once the rebellion had been decisively defeated, he or his supporters felt safe in poisoning Zewditu. Speculation as to the cause of Zewditu's death continues today.|$|E
