Methylfenidate is licensed to prescribe above the age of 6 years, but most of the antidepressants and benzodiazepines are not approved in children. We studied the <b>off-label</b> and unlicensed <b>prescribing</b> of psychotropics in children in Dutch general practice.

Among the 97 072 listed patients 12 years used them for nocturnal enuresis, anxiety, depression and several other psychic problems (TCAs) and for depression and anxiety (SSRIs and SNRIs).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the use of off-label antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and paediatric wards in Jordan. Methods: Data of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care units and paediatric wards in King Abdulla University Hospital were collected over an 8 -week survey between May and July 2012. Data collected in this study included patients’ age, weight, medical history, diagnosis and the details of antibiotics prescribed to each patient. Results: The study involved a total of 250 children (80 admitted to the NICU and 170 admitted to the wards). A total of 598 antibiotic prescriptions were issued for these patients (244 in NICUs and 354 in paediatricwards). The results {{of the present study}} show that <b>off-label</b> antibiotic <b>prescribing</b> to paediatric patients is very common. <b>Off-label</b> antibiotic <b>prescribing</b> to paediatric patients is related mostly to doses and indications, and rarely to age.

40|$|Aim: Antibiotic {{drugs are}} most {{frequently}} used by 0 - to 4 -year-old children. We performed a cross-sectional study in the Netherlands using a pharmacy prescription database to investigate the use, dose and course length of antibiotic drugs in 0 - to 4 -year-olds.

Prescriptions for {{children under the age}} of 3 months were excluded. Results: Children of 9 - 12 months of age received more antibiotics than children in other age groups. In the 3 - to 6 -month-olds, amoxicillin was prescribed in 75. 2 % of the cases. This percentage was 50. 4 % in the 4 -year-olds. The contribution of other broad-spectrum antibiotics increased with age (clarithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). Small-spectrum penicillins were prescribed less often than the broad-spectrum antibiotics. From the prescriptions of the five most used drugs, 97. 6 % were within the recommended dose range. Most course lengths corresponded with the guidelines. Of the prescriptions, 3. 9 % were unlicensed or off-label.

40|$|Respiratory {{drugs are}} widely used in {{children}} to treat labeled and non-labeled indications but only some data are available quantifying comprehensively off-label usage. Thus, we aim to analyse drug utilisation and <b>off-label</b> <b>prescribing</b> of respiratory drugs focusing on age- and indication-related off-label use. Patients aged ≤ 18 years documented in the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians database (approx. 2 million children) between 2004 and 2008 were included in our study. Annual period prevalence rates (PPRs) per 10, 000 children {{and the proportion of}} age- and indication-related off-label prescriptions were calculated and stratified by age and gender. Within the study period, highest PPRs were found for the fixed combination of clenbuterol/ambroxol (between 374 - 575 per 10, 000 children) and the inhaled short acting beta- 2 -agonist salbutamol (between 378 - 527 per 10, 000 children). Highest relative PPR increase was found for oral salbutamol (approx. 39 -fold) whereas the most distinct decrease was found for oral long-acting beta- 2 -agonist clenbuterol (- 97 %). Compound classes most frequently involved in <b>off-label</b> <b>prescribing</b> were inhaled bronchodilative compounds (91, 402; 37. 3 %) and oral beta- 2 -agonists (26, 850; 22. 5 %). The highest absolute number of off-label prescriptions were found for inhaled salbutamol (n = 67, 084; 42. 0 %) and oral clenbuterol/ambroxol (fixed combination, n = 18, 897; 20. 7 %). <b>Off-label</b> <b>prescribing</b> due to indication was of much greater relevance than age-related off-label use.

Long-term evidence, up to 5 years, of <b>off-label</b> <b>prescribed</b> methotrexate (MTX) and azathioprine (AZA) is lacking. To investigate long-term effectiveness, safety and drug survival of MTX and AZA. In an open-label follow up {{phase of a}} clinical trial patients were seen every 3 months for 5 years. MTX and AZA doses could be in- or decreased concurrent with daily clinical practice. Primary effectiveness outcomes were mean absolute and relative reduction in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) after 5 years compared to baseline. For safety type, frequency, severity and relatedness to treatment of adverse events were investigated. Drug survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves. Thirty-five of 43 originally included patients participated, of which 27 completed follow up. At year 5 mean relative reduction in SCORAD index was similar in MTX and AZA group: 52. 8 % and 53. 8 % by descriptive analysis. Eleven serious adverse events occurred in 5 years; for three there was a possible causal relationship. Drug survival demonstrated a longer survival for MTX, but survival in both groups was low after 5 years (MTX n= 5, AZA n= 1). Based on this relatively small pragmatic study, MTX and AZA seem to be effective and safe as maintenance treatments in moderate-to-severe AD up to 5 years. Few patients in both groups survive on their originally allocated drug although some discontinued due to controlled AD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserve...|$|R
