5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E

25|$|Australian rules {{football}} QFL {{games were}} {{played at the}} ground prior to and just after World War I.The ground hosted the 1950 Interstate Carnival, won by the Victorian Football League (VFL) side.The ground was also host to a VFL premiership match, Essendon vs Geelong, as part of Round 8, 1952. All VFL matches that week were moved to country and interstate venues {{in an effort to}} spread interest in the game. Originally to be played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the match was rescheduled due to torrential rain. Essendon (23.17) defeated Geelong (12.14) by 69 points the following Monday night in the first official VFL match to be played under floodlights.|$|E
25|$|The first {{broadcast}} of a VFL game was by 3AR in 1923, {{the year that}} broadcasting officially commenced in Australia. The first commentator was Wallace (Jumbo) Shallard, a former Geelong player {{who went on to}} have a long and respected career in print and broadcast media. The VFL/AFL has been broadcast every year since then by the ABC and (since 1927) by various commercial stations. The saturation period was the early 1960s when seven of the eight extant radio stations (3AR, 3UZ, 3DB, 3KZ, 3AW, 3XY and 3AK) broadcast VFL games each week, as well as broadcasts of Geelong games by local station 3GL. (At this time, the only alternative that radio listeners had to listening to the football <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> were the classical music and fine arts programs that were broadcast by 3LO).|$|E

Occasionally, 702 ABC Sydney may cover Swans matches if they are played <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match.

25|$|The {{regional}} assembly established short term schools - Tanganyika {{held its first}} weekend school in 1957. The school started <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> with an opening devotional program and the first class, followed by dinner and an evening of social activity. Sunday morning {{and part of the}} afternoon was devoted to more classes, panel discussions, demonstrations of the various procedures of Baha'i administrative life, such as elections and consultations, and question and answer sessions, and ending with a devotional. In early 1957 Gung moved from Tanganyika to Uganda where she founded a multi-racial kindergarten nursery. In April the Local Spiritual Assembly of Dar es Salaam obtained their civic registration according to the Trustee's Incorporation Ordinance of Tanganyika. The community of Tanganyika held three weekend schools in 1959. Four Tanganyikan's attended the centralized school held in Kampala in 1960. Conferences on the progress of the religion were held in 1960 at Mashi and Tunga with attendance by Hand of Cause Músá Banáni.|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E

Sitting in the kitchen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rainy <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> he committed to paper a few paragraphs regarding a detective named Morse.

60|$|The {{sight of}} a certain old gentleman as he walked along the shady side of Twenty-second Street about two o'clock <b>on</b> <b>a</b> broiling <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in midsummer was one not easily to be forgotten. A younger man, tall and vigorous, clad in a thin suit of blue serge, walked by his side. They were {{followed}} by a shouting troop of small boys who overran the pavements, and {{some of whom were}} armed with baseball bats. The big trolley car was hailed by a dozen dirty little hands.|$|R
2500|$|As a cricket {{commentator}} he was {{articulate and}} often drily humorous. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> sport programme, Neil Durden-Smith once {{mentioned that he}} had been having tea with the Bishop of Leicester. On being cued in, Gibson began his commentary stint with: [...] "No episcopal visitations here." [...] His cricket writing for The Times was generally light-hearted, often concentrating more on his journey to the match (invariably by train, often changing at Didcot, rarely straightforward) than on the cricket itself. On at least one occasion his day's report was published even though rain had prevented any cricket from taking place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{son of the}} vice-provost of Eton College, George Dupuis {{was educated}} there and at King's College, Cambridge. He was a middle-order batsman at Eton and played in the annual Eton v Harrow match for three seasons from 1851: {{it is not known}} whether he was right- or left-handed. At Cambridge University he went {{straight}} into the university's first team in the 1854 trial match, but he failed to make runs in that or subsequent matches across the next two seasons and could not secure his place. In 1856, he played only a single first-class game for a [...] "Gentlemen of England" [...] amateur side. He did not win a Blue for appearing in the University Match against Oxford University until his fourth year at the university, which was his most successful in cricket; in the 1857 game, he scored 23 and 35 not out, which was his highest first-class score, and took his only first-class wicket. His comparative inactivity as a university cricketer may be explained by an anecdote recounted by H. S. Altham; Dupuis, Altham wrote, [...] "was refused leave by the Dean of King's to play in a University match on the score that the proper place for a scholar of King's <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>afternoon</b> was in chapel".|$|E

5000|$|Marsh {{mentions}} in {{an introduction}} that she named her detective Alleyn after the Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn, founder of Dulwich College, {{where her father}} had been a pupil.

So she bought six exercise books and a pencil at a local stationer and started A Man Lay Dead, involving a Murder Game, which was then popular at English weekend parties.|$|R
60|$|I {{must ask}} you to suppose a lapse of some time after the {{occurrence}} {{of the events that}} I have just been relating. During this interval, thanks to the kind assistance I had received at the outset, my position as a man of business had greatly improved.

Hunter was in top form and went the distance, not going to a three-ball count the entire game. While the Royals were able to halve that margin going into the ninth, Roy White's two-run double {{in the top of the}} frame gave the Yanks two insurance runs that were the final scoring in a tidy 4-1 win.|$|R
