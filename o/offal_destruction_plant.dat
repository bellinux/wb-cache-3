Populations of Isoëtes lacustris L. in the lakes differ with morphology of plants, abundance, frequency of occurrence, partial projected foliage cover. Development of populations of the spe-cies is limited by morphometric characteristics of lake hollow, hydrophysical and hydrochemical parameters of the environment. Evaluation of lake quillwort tole-rance to environmental conditions allows us to charac-terize lakes’ parameters as optimal for 4 lakes (Beloe, Luninets district; Bredno; Glubokoe; Cherbomyslo), non favorable, {{which has led to}} the oppression of the po-pulation and <b>destruction</b> of <b>plants</b> (Beloe, Gorodok district; Beloe, Myadel district; Svityaz’) and normal for 8 lakes.

40|$|Because plant deaths destroy {{specific}} capital {{with large}} local economic impacts and potentially important macroeconmic effects, understanding {{the causes of}} deaths and, in particular, why they are concentrated in cyclical downturns, is important. The reallocationtiming hypothesis posits that plants suffering adverse permanent demand/productivity shocks delay shutdowns until cyclical downturns when plant capacity is less valuable, while the fragility hypothesis posits that shutdowns occur in downturns because the option value of maintaining the plant through low profitability periods is too small. I show that the effect that a plant’s specific capital has on the timing of plant deaths differs across these two hypotheses and then use this insight to test the hypotheses’ relative importance. I find that fragility is the dominant cause of the countercyclical behavior of plant deaths. This suggests that the endogenous destruction of capital is likely an important amplification and propagation mechanism for cyclical shocks and that stabilization policies {{have the benefit of}} reduced capital <b>destruction.</b> <b>Plant</b> deaths, business cycle...|$|R
40|$|A {{high rate}} of on-farm cow {{mortality}} (i. e. unassisted death and euthanasia) is both a financial concern and an important animal welfare issue. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate the development of mortality in Swedish dairy herds and to identify characteristics associated with on-farm mortality at cow and herd levels. In paper I, two analyses were performed {{using data from the}} cattle database with the objective of identifying risk factors at the herd level: one multiple-year study of 6898 herds between 2002 and 2010; and one single-year study of 4252 herds in the year 2010. Paper II is based on information from a designed questionnaire sent in 2012 to herds with either high or low mortality rates to evaluate differences in herd characteristics. In paper III, data were retrieved from the cattle database to assess hazard rates for mortality at the cow level and included cows with a calving between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009 (209, 236 lactations). In paper IV, a field study on <b>destruction</b> <b>plants</b> was performed to assess the relative proportion of unassisted death and euthanasia. Dairy cow cadavers were examined and a hole in the forehead (caused by a bullet or a captive bolt) was used as an indication of euthanasia. Telephone interviews were carried out with the farmer to verify the type of death and to obtain a short anamnesis. The results show that the cow mortality rate has gradually increased between 2002 and 2010, from 5. 1 to 6. 6 deaths/ 100 cow-years. At the herd level, a larger herd size, longer calving intervals and the Swedish Holstein breed were associated with greater mortality. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher average milk yield, during autumn-winter, and in organically managed herds. In the questionnaire, the same effects of breed and herd size were identified, but also having cows on exercise pasture (instead of production pasture) during summer was associated with high mortality herds. At the cow level, the highest mortality hazards were found for traumatic events and diseases. The mortality hazard was higher in early lactation and increased with parity.

40|$|This study {{represents}} a preliminary {{evaluation of the}} effect of steam dilution and hydrogen addition on the oxidation of formaldehyde and benzene, chosen as representative of the Volatile Organic Compounds, in Mild condition by evaluating the autoignition time and the steady state attainment. These parameters are important in the design of thermal VOC <b>destruction</b> <b>plants</b> since they influence the abatement efficiency and, therefore, the plant dimension. It came out that steam dilution implies lower autoignition times and, on the other hand, longer times for the attainment of the steady state. In contrast, for very high water content there is an increase of the autoignition time. This implies that there is an optimum value of steam content that allows for the attainment of the steady state condition by the lowest residence time. Hydrogen addition to systems diluted in nitrogen promotes the oxidation reactions and anticipates the steady state condition. In in steam diluted systems hydrogen delays the autoignition of the mixtures even though anticipates the attainment of the complete destruction of the VOC. The rate of production analysis showed that the H 2 /O 2 reactions that promote the ignition and the destruction of VOC are sensibly modified by the presence of water and hydrogen...|$|R
