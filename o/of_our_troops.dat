25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops.</b> If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|In 1812, Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Wellington (and future duke), again {{attempted}} to take Badajoz, {{which had a}} French garrison of about 5,000 men. Siege operations commenced on 16 March; by early April, there were three practicable breaches [...] in the walls. These were assaulted by two British divisions on 6 April, reputed to be [...] "Wellington's bloodiest siege", {{with a loss of}} some 5,000 British soldiers out of 15,000, after a five-hour onslaught the storming of the breaches failed. The French also lost some 1,200 of their 5,000 soldiers in the battle. Despite the failure at the breaches, the castle and another section of undamaged wall had been attacked and the town was successfully taken by the British. The victorious troops massacred about 4,000 Spanish civilians. Wellington wrote to Lord Liverpool, [...] "The capture of Badajos affords as strong an instance of the gallantry <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> as has ever been displayed, but I anxiously hope that I shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they were put last night." [...] However, Wellington's storming of San Sebastián in 1813 was much like that of Badajoz.|$|E

2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances.

2500|$|The halftracks were {{initially}} extremely unpopular and dubbed [...] "Purple Heart Boxes" [...] (a grim {{reference to the}} US Army's decoration for combat wounds) by American troops. The chief complaints centered on the complete lack of overhead protection from airbursting artillery shells and that the armor was inadequate against machine gun fire. Omar Bradley quoted in his report about half-tracks that it was [...] "a competent and dependable contrivance. Its bad name resulted from the inexperience <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> who attempted {{to use it for}} too many things". In 1943, the M3 served in Sicily and Italy and received positive reports of it in action. It went into service in 1944 in Operation Overlord and served in Europe {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

2500|$|By 11 April Nelson had {{assembled}} the batteries on the heights overlooking the town. Hood then {{sent a message}} to Lacombe-Saint-Michel, advising him of the British positions and inviting him to surrender. The French commander simply responded [...] "I have hot shot for your ships and bayonets for your troops. When two thirds <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> are killed, I will then trust to the generosity of the English". His approach rebuffed, Hood ordered Nelson to open a heavy fire on the town's defences; the ensuing fire and counterfire between the British and French batteries has been described as [...] "immense". Hood also ordered the 24-gun sixth rate HMS Proselyte, a small ship captured from the French at the Siege of Toulon and armed with 12-pounder cannon, to enter the harbour under Captain Walter Serocold and bombard the seaward defences. Serocold's ship shifted at anchor however and became exposed to heated shot from the town's batteries. A number of red-hot cannonballs lodged in the ship's stores and a fire started that rapidly blazed out of control. Serocold continued his fire on the town while calling for help from the fleet, managing to evacuate Proselyte into ship's boats and escape the harbour before the ship was entirely consumed by the flames.|$|E
2500|$|Allen's {{response}} was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report {{could be made}} by a liaison officer or more senior officer. [...] MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. [...] To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: [...] "Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> in my opinion is faulty." [...] Allen replied, in part: [...] "I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel {{that they could not}} have done better." [...] Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having [...] "botched" [...] the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. [...] The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement [...] and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.|$|E
