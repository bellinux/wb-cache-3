John Donne's work Biathanatos, {{contained}} {{one of the first}} modern defences of suicide, bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as Jesus, Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Banquets {{have not}} been held at Westminster Hall since the {{coronation}} of GeorgeIV in 1821. His coronation was the most elaborate in history; his brother and successor WilliamIV eliminated the banquet <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> economy, ending a 632-year-old tradition. Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the coronation, a coronation honours list is also released before the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting is {{an ancient}} spectator sport. It formed {{part of the culture}} of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. It {{continues}} to be practised in South America and across South and Southeast Asia, often combined with betting on the result. It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> cruelty.|$|E

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|Written by Stephen Gallagher, this {{script was}} {{submitted}} in late 1982 but rejected by Saward <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> cost. The four-part story would involve the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough testing a Reality Simulator. This simulator projects a graveyard world overrun by the Vodyani who soon {{find a way}} out of the virtual reality and into the real world.|$|E
5|$|Aaronson {{was married}} three times. His first wife was the actress Lydia Sherwood (1906–1989), {{whom he was}} married to between 1924 and 1931. He filed for divorce <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> her {{adultery}} with the theatre producer Theodore Komisarjevsky, and the much publicised suit was undefended. His second marriage, which took place on 9 July 1938, to Dorothy Beatrice Lewer (1915–2005), also ended in divorce. On 14 January 1950, Aaronson married Margaret Olive Ireson (1920–1981), with whom he had one son, David, who was born in 1953.|$|E
40|$|This article reviews {{cases in}} which the Montana Supreme Court has invalidated or limited {{provisions}} of the standard auto policies. The article discusses three grounds when the Court generally has invalidated auto insurance provisions: 1) <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> public policy per the Mandatory Liability Protection Act; 2) <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> public policy per the Uninsured Motorist statute; and 3) <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> defeating insurance consumer 2 ̆ 7 s reasonable expectations. The article concludes that the list of auto insurance policy provisions invalidated by the Montana Supreme Court is extensive, confirming the Court 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to test insurance provisions to ensure they comport with public policy...|$|R

5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Wilson and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> cruelty in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E

Mathews gave birth to a daughter, Anaïs Gallagher, on 27 January 2000. Gallagher and Mathews divorced in January 2001 <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> his adultery with Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald. After the divorce was finalised, Gallagher admitted he had only claimed to have cheated in order to speed up the divorce process and that he had never actually been unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of the Basic Law aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of their seats replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space.

The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA.

5|$|Michael {{automatically}} succeeded as king upon Ferdinand's {{death and}} the regency council took charge of his role as monarch. In May 1928, Carol, who had found his life abroad with Magda Lupescu unsatisfactory, attempted to return to Romania {{with the help of}} the 1st Viscount Rothermere. He was prevented from doing so by English authorities, who then proceeded to expel him from England. Infuriated, Marie sent an official apology to George V on behalf of her son, who had already begun plotting a coup d'état.

Shaftesbury and de Paolis were declared husband and wife at the Westminster Register Office in front of a few friends, with none of his family in attendance.

5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E
