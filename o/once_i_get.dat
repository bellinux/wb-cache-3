2500|$|Parks {{underwent}} unsuccessful hand {{surgery in}} 2014, causing {{his hands to}} freeze after about forty minutes of playing piano. On May 9, 2015, Parks performed what he called his [...] "final piano performance" [...] at the Largo in Los Angeles. Guest performers included singer Gaby Moreno; songwriter-producer Joe Henry; Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste; New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra; and jazz guitarist-composer Grant Geissman. On upcoming projects, Parks said: [...] " [...] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> that done. I will be looking to find a celebrated string quartet to take things to an irreducible minimum. I {{can pick up a}} quartet in Peoria, or in Europe, to perform something like this. I also hope to find a film project that interests me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chase {{was mostly}} led by [...] while [...] also chipped in. As the lead group {{continued}} to gain time, Busche told his teammate Voigt [...] "you look pretty good, why don't {{you go for}} the stage?". Voigt did exactly that and with [...] to race until the finish line he launched an attack {{that would not be}} nullified. He crossed the line in Avila Beach solo, registering his first victory of the year. The large group of escapees he was part of came in 6 seconds later, and the whole peloton a minute and seven seconds in arrears. The general classification was reshuffled, with Van Garderen taking the lead from Acevedo and Michael Rogers going from fifth to second. 41-year-old veteran Voigt said in his typical good humored fashion when interviewed after his victory: [...] "I just did the same move I've been doing since the ice age, and I couldn't believe they let me go. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> 20 seconds, I'm gone. I looked back and said, 'I can't believe they're giving me 20 seconds, don't they know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2017, {{during an}} {{interview}} with The Breakfast Club radio show, T.I. revealed he would retire from making music after three more solo albums: [...] "I'm ready {{to get the hell}} outta here, though. I got, like, two, I got, this next album and two, I got three more albums in my head, conceptualized. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> them out, I'm done. [...] We're still doing it. … [...] The next one is more like trap music. It’s Trap Muzik 2017. And the one after that, it’s gonna be more like a, uh, love as it pertains to a dope boy. And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Frances Freeland put {{her hand}} under his arm. [...] "Now, don't fuss, darling! Here's sixpence for the porter. There's only one trunk--it's got a violet label. Do you know them? They're so useful. You see them at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> you some." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor fellow, thought Captain Delano, bitter {{experience}} has {{taught him that}} one ripple {{does not make a}} wind, any more than one swallow a summer. But he is mistaken for <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> his ship in for him, and prove it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, this is {{only some}} of Hardy Baker's doings, and I can soon {{put an end to}} it, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> that {{precious}} little villain by the throat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they ask}} me, I shall {{certainly}} go. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> started I'm not afraid. But for all that," [...] Henrietta {{added in a}} moment, [...] "I'm not satisfied; I'm not at peace about Isabel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make it!" [...] said Berrie. [...] "Of course we'll make it. Don't {{you worry}} {{about that for a}} minute. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of the green timber the dark won't worry me. We'll push right through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him that}} I agree to his price. I don't want {{the trouble of}} getting food. As he will be going so early, I will come on board at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> my bundle, and {{will be back in}} half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it might do anyhow, Godfrey, {{and the idea is}} a very good one. Well, let us set about it at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> a piece of fresh bone to try on; no doubt they kill a sheep here every day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank heavens, it's {{all over}} now. We've {{none of us}} had any sleep for three days, and when <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> off <b>I</b> don't mean to wake up for a week.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I, Merwell. But it can't be done--at least, I am {{not coming}} back to this forlorn district, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to town again. And it looks {{dangerous}} to me, with all these loose rocks ready to slide down into the valley," [...] added Job Haskers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, Monsieur my brother," [...] said Madame in her loudly-pitched voice, [...] "do {{you expect}} me to make before you my best Versailles curtsey, for--with my rheumatic knee--I warn you that <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> down, you might find it very {{difficult}} to get me up on my feet again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I came {{safely to}} shore, sweetheart, and well does this kiss {{pay for all}} I did. And as for Ospakar, if but <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> these arms about him, I fear him little, or any man, and I covet that sword of his greatly. But we can talk more {{certainly}} of these things to-morrow." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{teenage years}} I {{was a very}} {{frustrated}} and angry person. I just had an attitude {{that the world was}} against me and boxing was an incredible outlet for me. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> started <b>getting</b> into boxing <b>I</b> put the rest of the troublemaking off to the side and started really getting a little more focused with my life.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Franklin M. Heller, one of television's {{pioneering}} directors, essentially {{saved the}} show. He {{felt that the}} biggest problems with the show were too much camera movement and lens changing. Heller said, [...] "I figured <b>once</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> those cameramen and their flowered shirts controlled and fairly immobile, {{we might be able}} to let this show emerge." ...|$|R
60|$|You've got a {{good enough}} memory not to have {{forgotten}} that you made a blithering fool of me <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> swore I'd <b>get</b> even with you, and by George, I mean to do it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now about {{restoring}} the marquis,' said Merton. 'He's here, of course; {{it was easy}} enough to get him into an asylum. Might I suggest a gag, if by chance {{you have such a}} thing about you? To be removed, of course, when <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> him into the house of a friend. And the usual bandage over his eyes: he must never know where he has been.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That night little Mr. Frog {{studied and}} studied, {{trying to think}} of some way by which he could get up in the bushes and trees and clear them of bugs and worms. 'If only I could hold on <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up there, I would be all right,' thought he. 'Then I could leave the bugs and worms on the ground for my cousins the Toads to look after, while I look after those beyond their reach.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{suddenly}} {{broke into}} laughter, and ejaculated: [...] "Say, {{that was hard}} work! Don't you hate {{to have to be}} serious? Let's trot down, and I'll make Tom or Duncan rush us a growler of beer to welcome you to our midst.... I'll bet your socks aren't darned properly. I'm going to sneak in {{and take a look at}} them, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> you caged up here.... But I won't read your love-letters! Now let's go down by the fire, where it's comfy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, if {{you want}} me to," [...] assented Anne cheerfully. [...] "I'd do {{anything}} to oblige you. But you'll have to tell me what to say for this <b>once.</b> After <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into bed I'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always. I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to think of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He didn't finish. Instead, {{he spread}} his broad wings and flew back towards the nest and Mrs. Hooty. His great wings made no noise, for they are made {{so that he can}} fly without making a sound. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> hold of one of those Crows!" [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> hold of one of those Crows, I'll--" [...] He didn't say what he would do, but if you had been near enough to hear the snap of his bill, you could have guessed the rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next time}} we meet you'll see him go down and out," [...] added the tall boy. [...] "He won't be in it a minute after <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Simon looked shocked. [...] "No, wife, you misjudge me. It is a rough world, and we {{must take}} queer cuts to fortune, but <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there, respectability for me and {{a seat in the}} village church, provided, of course, that it is orthodox. I know that you come of the people, and your {{instincts}} are of the people, but I can never forget that my grandfather was a gentleman," [...] and Simon puffed himself out and looked at the ceiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, Shorty," [...] replied Smoke. [...] "I'll {{make the}} round trip {{and be back}} in Dawson in six weeks. The Yukon trail is packed, and the first hundred miles {{or so of the}} Stewart ought to be packed. Old-timers from Henderson have told me a number of outfits went up last fall after the freeze-up. When I strike their trail I ought to hit her up forty or fifty miles a day. I'm likely to be back inside a month, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> across." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{those things}} are between yourselves, and you seem to me both poor creatures at best." [...] Mrs. Gereth spoke with a rich humor which tipped with light for an instant a real conviction. [...] "I don't know what you've got in your veins: you absurdly exaggerated the difficulties. But enough {{is as good as}} a feast, and when <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> you abroad {{together}}--!" [...] She checked herself as if from excess of meaning; what might happen when she should get them abroad together was to be gathered only from the way she slowly rubbed her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{need not}} worry myself by {{thinking}} of it, now. It will all come some day, and I dare say I shall find it pleasant enough, when <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> accustomed to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! don't you trouble about that, Alan. If <b>once</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> hold {{of those}} dim {{thousands}} you {{will soon be}} able to make more, for unto him that hath shall be given. But at present they are very dim, and for all I know may be represented by stock in deceased companies. In short, the financial position is extraordinarily depressed, {{as they say in the}} Market Intelligence in The Times. But that's no reason why we should be depressed also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no, no," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{must not}} wait here. If <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>get</b> {{out of the}} house I shall feel safe. Of course I shall go anyway, but I don't want any quarrelling on this Christmas morning." ...|$|R

6000|$|I was--you shall hear {{immediately}} why I am not now--Egbert Craddock Cummins. The name remains. I {{am still}} (Heaven help me!) Dramatic Critic to the Fiery Cross. What I shall be {{in a little}} while I do not know. I write in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I can to make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must bear with me a little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity, he naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself.

6000|$|... "I think not," [...] Lane {{answered}} grimly. [...] "If there's {{anything of}} that sort going about, I shall board my yacht yonder and hoist the Stars and Stripes.

6000|$|Oh, it's absurd. I won't let you. You're {{making us}} both utterly wretched. I won't let you {{sacrifice}} our happiness. Oh, Hilda, I love you. I can't live without you. At first I tried to resist seeing you. I used to pass your door {{and look up}} at your windows; and the door seemed {{as if it were}} waiting for me. And {{at the end of the}} street I used to look back. Oh, how I used to want to come in and see you <b>once</b> more! <b>I</b> thought if I saw you just <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>get</b> over it. And at last I couldn't help myself. I'm so weak. Do you despise me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come with me," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't do {{to neglect}} the Press; {{you can see}} the possibilities. It's one of the few {{countries}} left.
