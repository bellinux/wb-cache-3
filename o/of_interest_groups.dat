40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> mobilization in EU legislative politics is heavily focused on organizations {{as much attention}} is concentrated on groups’ organizational characteristics, their activities towards different institutional venues, and their attempts to influence policies in one or a small set of policy cases. Yet, despite our growing knowledge about <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics, we know little about the pervasiveness of lobbying or the patterns of conflict and mobilization in EU <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics. How are conflict and mobilization in EU <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics structured? Can we speak of structural patterns <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> conflict and mobilization or is the EU rather a balkanized lobbying arena? In order to analyze these questions we adopt a policy-centered account, instead of an organization-centered perspective, <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics. More precisely, for a sample of 116 pieces of legislation we analyze the scope <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> mobilization, the divisiveness of mobilization processes {{and the nature of}} conflict that is mobilized through the activities of lobbyists. For our empirical analyses, we triangulate evidence from different sources including media-analyses, interviews with 80 experts in the European Commission, interviews with 143 lobbyists and consultations. We conclude with a discussion of how our understanding of conflict structures complements policy field- and organization-based explanations <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> politics...|$|R

25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion that {{democracy is}} government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
25|$|On December 18, 2009, {{outgoing}} Governor Kaine proposed $76.8 {{billion of}} expenditures for adoption by the incoming state legislature. Kaine's budget proposed to rationalize state revenues {{by increasing the}} income tax while lowering property taxes and other fees. As incoming governor, McDonnell refused to publicly recommend any modifications to Kaine's budget and instead worked with the House of Delegates to bring Kaine's plan up for a quick vote and defeat. Privately, McDonnell advocated cutting $300 million from health programs, $730 million from K-12 education, changing the state retirement system, and requiring 10 days of furloughs for state employees, to offset budgetary shortfalls for 2010–2012. On February 17, 2010, after political pressure, McDonnell publicly released his proposed cuts. The Senate adopted a budget which restored a number of cuts to education, health and human services, and a House-Senate conference managed {{to work out a}} compromise on March 14 containing about $250 million in cuts before the expiration of the legislative session. However, a number <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> lobbied the governor to use his amendatory veto power to alter the adopted budget.|$|E
25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{outlines}} the framework for the investigation. Drawing from the literature on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> coalitions, the framework presents a range of criteria to distinguish patterns <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> collaboration. Ideas from the literature on American and European interest representation and new institutionalism complete the framework by creating a list of factors with the potential to drive the formation and membership <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> coalitions. The second part of the paper comprises a case study <b>of</b> a public <b>interest</b> coalition involving European level environmental, consumer, citizen and public health groups.

40|$|I analyze a model <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> {{influence}} on legislative voting through information trans-mission. The model shows how <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> may craft different messages to target different winning coalitions {{in order to}} influence the outcome. If access to legislators is costly then <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> prefer to coordinate with allied legislators by providing them with information that helps them to persuade less sympathetic legislators. The model reconciles informational theories of lobbying with empirical evidence suggesting that <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> predominantly lobby those who already agree with them. The model also makes new predictions about the welfare effects <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> influence: from an ex ante perspective, informational lobbying negatively effects the welfare of legislators.

40|$|Assuming that <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> like households, firms, or {{any other}} {{structured}} organization, have limited budgets but broad objectives, how do they pick and choose which battles to fight? The issue <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> battle choice has received little direct attention in the literature, {{in large part because}} defining the state space <b>of</b> total <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> activity is often difficult to do in practice. This paper is able to overcome such a difficulty by drawing on a unique dataset regarding the hydroelectric dam relicensing process in the United States. In this context, it turns out that geography and strategic considerations are the two most important categories <b>of</b> variables affecting <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> battle choice...|$|R

2500|$|The {{constituency}} model {{takes the}} political model's definition {{of performance and}} expands it to also include the preferences of the organization's other constituents, including workers and customers. As such, organizations are [...] "assemblages <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> whose agendas are in competition, rather than maximizers" [...] of any set of limited, defined criteria; instead, [...] "something approaching social welfare, but not the welfare of any particular group, is maximized under the constituency model". Under this model, as with the political model, strictly following performance measures does not actually provide the best outcome for the organization. In fact, since each measure reflects a particular subgroup's own interests rather than {{the interests of the}} organization as a whole, from an organizational standpoint, change in performance criteria would be highly beneficial. Change in performance measures only occurs, though, when either the constituencies themselves or the power structures between these constituencies change, making agents again eschew change because of the associated disruption and instability.|$|E

40|$|The role <b>of</b> {{organized}} <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> is a {{key consideration}} {{in the study of}} political systems. While contemporary popular usage has transformed the term “interest group ” into an epithet, a less normative use communicates merely a collection of individuals with shared concerns. As political systems are fundamentally about the hammering out of collective decisions for populations with disparate demands, the manner in which interests are aggregated and represented is quite critical to any understanding of the policymaking process. <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> – sometimes referred to as pressure groups or lobbying groups – {{play a significant role in}} transnational governance. In every substantive area, the rules and regulations generated by global governance organizations (GGOs) have profound consequences for a variety of constituencies. The differential effectiveness of the formal organizations representing those constituencies, and the fundamental qualities <b>of</b> latent <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> that determine whether a formal organization emerges, influence the policy outcomes reached through the GGO decisionmaking process.
