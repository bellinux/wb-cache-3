5|$|In Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Deanâ€™s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and <b>outbound</b> flights. In Atlantic Canada, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, without {{knowledge}} of the township council, New Jersey Transit announced further and drastic service cuts at Great Notch. The only train to serve <b>outbound</b> customers was a train leaving for Hoboken Terminal in the morning, and two trains from Hoboken would serve the station at night.|$|E

5|$|Not {{all of the}} ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, Kroonland hit the {{breakwater}} in Dover Harbour, disabling {{the steering}} gear and delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, Kroonland ran aground in Ambrose Channel during a heavy fog while <b>outbound</b> from New York. It took more than six hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud.|$|E
5|$|Although the Grand Fleet {{made several}} sorties {{over the next}} few years it is not known if Agincourt participated in them. On 23April 1918, Agincourt and Hercules were {{stationed}} at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and <b>outbound</b> convoys were in port when the Germans reached their normal route so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming <b>outbound</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|Express routes run {{between the}} {{outskirts}} of the city and downtown or between major rail stations and other points in the city. These routes typically run only during peak hours, going inbound in the morning and <b>outbound</b> in the evening, except the 76X Marin Headlands Express, which runs on weekends and holidays; and the 83X Mid-Market Express, which runs in both directions during peak hours. Asterisked (*) routes indicate that they run only during morning peak hours.|$|E
5|$|Exxon Valdez {{departed}} {{the port}} of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the <b>outbound</b> traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|The Green Line {{stations}} at Greenbelt, College Park, Prince George's Plaza, and West Hyattsville {{opened in}} November 1993. Almost two years later, WMATA broke {{ground on the}} Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights stations, a $900 million project which would complete the final 6.5 miles (10.5km) of the originally-planned 103-mile (165.7km) Metrorail system in late 1999. The <b>outbound</b> tunnel to Congress Heights was completed in June 1998. The Georgia Avenue-Petworth and Columbia Heights stations were completed in September 1999, three months ahead of schedule. The Green Line's final five stations opened on January 13, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to <b>outbound</b> travelers.|$|E
5|$|Blue Streak {{service on}} Route 41 began on September 8, 1970, {{traveling}} on local streets between Sand Point, Lake City and Northgate Mall, and proceeding onto Interstate 5 non-stop to Downtown Seattle. Blue Streak buses were given exclusive {{use of the}} Columbia and Cherry ramps on the Interstate 5 reversible express lanes, {{as well as a}} bus-only lane on 5th Avenue. Buses traveled primarily on 3rd Avenue through Downtown, heading northbound during morning inbound trips and southbound during afternoon <b>outbound</b> trips towards Northgate. Buses ran at a frequency of 7 to 15 minutes from 7a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The trip between Northgate and downtown took an average of 15 minutes, and took near-full busloads on the first day. The 22 buses on Blue Streak service were initially colored red, but were later repainted blue to match the branding.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, the MBTA {{published}} a feasibility study exploring {{the possibility of}} rebuilding Yawkey as a full-service station. The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60%, from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937. On November 15, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station, originally {{expected to be completed}} in the spring of 2012. The new station has two full-length high-level platforms that provide level, handicapped-accessible boarding for all passengers; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility. The two 700-foot-long platforms (a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform {{on the south side of}} the tracks) are connected with an overpass, and passengers no longer have to cross the tracks to access certain <b>outbound</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to housing {{the rental car}} facilities, a six-story parking garage (which {{is attached to the}} terminal) provides long-term and short-term parking. Lower cost satellite parking options, with continuous free shuttle service, {{can be found in the}} Blue, Red and Green parking lots along International Gateway. The Blue lot is the closest to the terminal and also offers some covered parking. The cost of parking a car in the blue lot is $9 per 24 hours. The Red Lot costs $7 per 24 hours and the green lost costs $5 per 24 hours to park.The Green lot is the furthest away from the terminal. Additionally, there is a free cell phone lot accessed from the <b>outbound</b> side of International Gateway.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to light rail service, Pioneer Square {{station and the}} Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel are served by six King County Metro bus routes and one Sound Transit Express bus route. The bus routes are divided into three bays by their <b>outbound</b> direction: Bay A is served by three routes heading north toward Northgate and the University District and east towards Kirkland (routes 41, 74 and 255); Bay C is served by three routes heading south through the SODO Busway toward Kent and Renton (routes 101, 102 and 150); and Bay D is served by one route heading east via Interstate 90 to Bellevue (Sound Transit Express route 550).|$|E
5|$|International District/Chinatown {{station is}} the {{southern}} terminus of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, served by six King County Metro bus routes and one Sound Transit Express bus route, {{as well as}} Sound Transit's Central Link light rail line. The bus routes are divided into three bays by their <b>outbound</b> direction: Bay A is served by three routes (routes 41, 74 and 255) heading north toward Northgate and the University District and east towards Kirkland; Bay C is served by three routes (routes 101, 102 and 150) heading south through the SODO Busway toward Kent and Renton; and Bay D is served by one route (Sound Transit Express route 550) heading east via Interstate 90 to Bellevue.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Ã˜stfold Line at SjursÃ¸ya, while the <b>outbound</b> track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Ã˜stfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Ã˜stfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loengaâ€“Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Ã˜stfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Ã˜stfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the <b>outbound</b> track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E
5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the <b>outbound</b> platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Framingham/Worcester line {{schedule}} was changed slightly in April 2012 {{to allow for}} temporary single-tracking through the station for construction. Actual station construction activity started in June 2012, and in August one track was cut, reducing the line to one track through the station. The platforms were installed in late November 2012; construction of the elevator shafts began in February 2013. A temporary ramp opened in June 2013 for passengers to use {{the east end of}} the future <b>outbound</b> platform; the old platform was demolished soon afterwards {{to make room for the}} west ends of the new platforms. The pedestrian bridge was lifted into place in August 2013, followed by the various roof and canopy elements. The second track was rebuilt in late September, followed by the remaining platform segments.|$|E
5|$|West Honaker {{took on a}} load {{of grain}} and then {{proceeded}} in convoy from Boston to Halifax in early May, and on to Belfast Lough. After making a circuit to Avonmouth and Milford Haven, West Honaker sailed from Belfast Lough for New York on 25 June. She made one additional transatlantic roundtrip beginning in late August, carrying a cargo of explosives on her <b>outbound</b> trip, and returning in late October. West Honaker sailed 28 November from New York for Nuevitas, Cuba, and returned via Key West, Florida, in late December. Sailing again for the Caribbean on 6 February, she visited GuantÃ¡namo Bay and Antilla before her 28 February 1944 return to New York. At some point within the next month, West Honaker arrived at Boston.|$|E
5|$|With this {{possibility}} in mind, the American battleships set out, {{accompanied by the}} ships of the British Third Light Cruiser Squadron and two flotillas of destroyers, all {{under the command of}} Admiral Rodman. This marked {{the first time in history}} that British warships had ever served under the command of a sea-going American admiral. Although the <b>outbound</b> trip to Norway was uneventful, things began to heat up for the escort force on 8 February, as they waited just outside Norwegian territorial waters for the return convoy to assemble. Shortly before 14:00, both Florida and Delaware reported sighting numerous torpedoes running in the water, and began maneuvering sharply to avoid being struck.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>outbound</b> O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, {{followed}} by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
5|$|The Great Notch train station, {{formerly}} known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey Transit facility in the Great Notch section of Little Falls, New Jersey. The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four <b>outbound</b> evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located {{at the intersection of}} Notch Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first on the line to be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm.|$|E
5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, <b>outbound</b> capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect <b>outbound</b> connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E
5|$|The little {{railroad}} went broke a {{few years}} later. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad (AO) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30miles (43km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P) at Siloam Springs. The AO planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO and the Monte Ne, a track {{would have to be}} laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, and they would not allow a connection. The AO instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco. The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its <b>outbound</b> freight business to the AO rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at Limedale. The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The <b>outbound</b> tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E
25|$|The WW hauled {{potatoes}}, lumber, {{and poultry}} {{along with other}} general freight and passengers. Freight tonnage in 1914 was 43% <b>outbound</b> lumber, 16% <b>outbound</b> potatoes and canned corn, 14% inbound feed and grain, 10% inbound manufactured goods, 5% inbound coal, and 4% <b>outbound</b> hay.|$|E
25|$|The PageRank {{transferred}} from a given page to {{the targets of}} its <b>outbound</b> links upon the next iteration is divided equally among all <b>outbound</b> links.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the convoys forced the German U-boats in the Atlantic to divert their {{attention}} from inbound shipping to <b>outbound.</b> In response, the first <b>outbound</b> convoy left for Hampton Roads on 11 August 1917. It was followed by matching <b>outbound</b> convoys for each regular route. These were escorted by destroyers as they left Britain and were {{taken over by the}} typical cruiser fotillas as they entered the open ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Government {{issued a}} black <b>outbound</b> travel alert for Fukushima {{prefecture}} on 12 March urging to avoid all travel. The alert came {{in addition to}} the red <b>outbound</b> travel alert for the rest of Japan.|$|E
25|$|The I/O {{interface}}, also a Rambus design, {{is known}} as FlexIO. The FlexIO interface is organized into 12 lanes, each lane being a unidirectional 8-bit wide point-to-point path. Five 8-bit wide point-to-point paths are inbound lanes to Cell, while the remaining seven are <b>outbound.</b> This provides a theoretical peak bandwidth of 62.4GB/s (36.4GB/s <b>outbound,</b> 26GB/s inbound) at 2.6GHz. The FlexIO interface can be clocked independently, typ. at 3.2GHz. 4 inbound + 4 <b>outbound</b> lanes are supporting memory coherency.|$|E
