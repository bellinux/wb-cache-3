5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing that African American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E

5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.|$|E

25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle will not <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{inadequate}} {{infrastructure to}} accommodate their surging population, informal settlements {{on the outskirts}} of the cities are being formed. Many refugees deforest the unexplored land and build squatters settlements, or slums, on the steeps, exploiting many hilly areas. Development of these hilly lands not <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> the rate of erosion but also put the inhabitants vulnerable to the risk of landslide, adding factors of insecurity to the already underprivileged community. Although these settlements are illegal, the government does not have the will nor power to form urban plans, strategies to stop people from migrating, or to regulate the migrants' behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{ease with}} which the OKW assumed the Eastern {{campaign}} could be won did {{not take into account}} the enormous distances. This caused supply breakdowns and a big drop in the serviceability rates, reserves of spare parts, fuel and ammunition.

On occasion, only the transport fleet could fly in supplies to keep units operational. The Luftwaffeâ€™s operating radius was to go no deeper than Moscow, and stretched from Leningrad to Rostov-on-Don. This meant German air power was operating in a theatre of 579,150 square miles. The Luftwaffe started on a 995 miles front, which extended to 1,240 from Leningrad to Rostov, then a further 620 miles from Leningrad to Murmansk.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all {{research}} in algal biofuels {{has focused on}} culturing single species, or monocultures, of microalgae. However, ecological theory and empirical {{studies have demonstrated that}} plant and algae polycultures, i.e. groups of multiple species, tend to produce larger yields than monocultures. Experiments have also shown that more diverse aquatic microbial communities tend to be more stable through time than less diverse communities. Recent studies found that polycultures of microalgae produced significantly higher lipid yields than monocultures. Polycultures also tend to be more resistant to pest and disease outbreaks, as well as invasion by other plants or algae. Thus culturing microalgae in polyculture may not <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> yields and stability of yields of biofuel, but also reduce the environmental impact of an algal biofuel industry.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a strong}} critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policy. He voted against the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, {{claiming}} that the cuts contained in those bills would <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> the national debt. He derided the prescription drug plan passed in 2003 as a giveaway to companies that donate to the Republican Party. He {{is one of the}} House's most vehement opponents of free trade agreements and was strongly opposed to the Bush administration's proposals for reforming Social Security. He has also voted at times with more liberal members of the House with regards to Cuba. Since coming to the House, he has voted in favor of most campaign finance laws and other laws favored by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party to reform politics.|$|E

The salary in the fourth season may increase (or decrease) by up to 4.1% of the salary in the third season.

25|$|The photons of a {{light beam}} have a {{characteristic}} energy proportional to {{the frequency of the}} light. In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function (the electron binding energy) of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalently frequency) of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.|$|E
25|$|Galbraith's main ideas focused {{around the}} {{influence}} of the market power of large corporations. He believed that this market power weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest market power to increase the production of their goods beyond an efficient amount. He further believed that market power {{played a major role in}} inflation. He argued that corporations and trade unions could <b>only</b> <b>increase</b> prices to the extent to which that their market power allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive market power, price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith's view of market power was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of U.S. firms played a part in the success of the U.S. economy.|$|E
