500|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 60 minutes. The session {{began with}} the slowest driver in the weekend's combined practice sessions going out first with the quickest competitor heading <b>out</b> <b>last.</b> Each driver was restricted to two timed laps. Conditions for the one-hour session were sunny and warm. Tagliani clinched his second pole position {{of the season and}} the third of his career with a time of 31.935 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by da Matta. Bräck qualified third, Herta fourth and Fittipaldi fifth after he made changes to make his car go faster. Papis, Jourdain, Junqueira, Jimmy Vasser and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. After completing his lap, Jourdain switched off his engine when smoke came out of his car's left-hand side leaving turn two and qualifying was temporarily stopped to allow course officials to extract his car. Gidley was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his fastest time was five-tenths of a second off Tagliani's pace.

500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold <b>out</b> <b>last</b> year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying <b>out</b> <b>last</b> year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, perhaps, is all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet.

But I wanted to perfect my stuff, because I didn't think it was wrapped. I always felt like it was missing three records. Even when I was done with the album, like a lot of these songs that I have on this album was made in 2012. I spent the whole 2013 trying to find four to three records that fit the album, that took my album to that level." [...] During the same interview, Schoolboy Q compared the album to Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; he also admitted he analyzed Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album as he crafted his own work: [...] "Yes, I studied Kendrick, because {{he is one of the}} heavy hitters in the game." ...|$|E

While recording Relapse2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result {{did not seem to}} him as continuation of Relapse but more of an individual project that deserved its own name. Eminem said: [...] "I had originally planned for Relapse2 to come <b>out</b> <b>last</b> year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." [...] The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.|$|E

2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. I was sitting there with a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing <b>out</b> <b>Last</b> Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E
