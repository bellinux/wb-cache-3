25|$|Europe's largest {{windfarm}} is the 'London Array', an <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> {{farm in the}} Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom, with {{a current}} capacity of 630 MW (and thus the world's largest <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> farm). Other large wind farms in Europe include Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm near Constanța, Romania with 600 MW capacity, and Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow, Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013 SAS Group began daily {{operations}} to Copenhagen, only {{to withdraw the}} service in April 2014 because of disappointing passenger numbers. However, Sun Air launched twice-weekly flights to Aalborg and Billund in April 2016, {{in order to support}} the <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> industry in the Humber and Jutland locations. These flights were also suspended in December 2016.|$|E

50|$|As Southerndown, {{along with}} nearby Ogmore-by-Sea, is a west-facing beach (and hence on the Atlantic coast), <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds</b> from the East {{generate}} much good-quality surf, {{helped by the}} warming effects of the Gulf Stream.|$|R
50|$|When the {{air that}} has been heated on the {{extensive}} central plateau flows down the escarpment to the coast it undergoes further warming by adiabatic processes. This accounts for the hot and dry properties of these <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds,</b> wherever they occur along South Africa's coastline.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Denmark's {{capacity}} grew to 3,482MW; most of {{the increase}} came from the 209MW Horns Rev 2 offshore wind farm, which was inaugurated on September17, 2009 by Crown Prince Frederik. In 2010, capacity grew to 3,752MW, and {{most of the}} year's increase came from the Rødsand-2 <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> farm. In 2014, the largest increase came from the 400MW Anholt wind farm.|$|E
25|$|Installation {{and service}} / {{maintenance}} of <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic {{operation of a}} wind farm. , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) {{as well as for}} maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.|$|E

The seafront {{features}} a Victorian bandstand and gardens, amusement arcades, and children's play areas. Landmarks by the seafront include the Clock Tower, the sea defence jetty, the off-shore World War II sea fort and the <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> farm. There are seaside cafés, fresh seafood restaurants, guesthouses, beach huts and numerous water-sports facilities.|$|E
50|$|On-shore and <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds</b> can be {{extremely}} strong, as the lake warms and cools more slowly than the land. Sudden, violent storms are frequent. Three rivers (the Omo, Turkwel and Kerio) flow into the lake, but lacking outflow, its only water loss is by evaporation. Lake volume and dimensions are variable. For example, its level fell by 10 metres between 1975 and 1993.|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{particle}} size distributions and meteorological parameters were measured during the MAPTIP {{experiment in the}} fall of 1993 in the vicinity of MeetPost Noordwijk (MPN), a platform at 9 km from the Dutch coast. One data set was collected at MPN, the other on board of a ship that sailed down and cross wind trajectories. from MPN to a distance of 200 km. Both the aerosol concentration and extinction respond to variations in the meteorological conditions. For down wind trajectories, the responses at ship and platform are observed with a delay in accordance with the time it takes for an air mass to travel from one to the other. For cross wind trajectories, the responses are observed simultaneously at ship and platform. The comparison of ship and platform also shows that the meteorological conditions change as a function of fetch in <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds.</b> This fetch effect does not show up clearly in the aerosol concentrations, which suggests that in <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds</b> the influence of the land (natural, industrial and urban aerosol) extends up to more than 200 km from the coast...|$|R
40|$|A {{meteorological}} {{study of}} winds temperatures and Pasquill stability categories {{was conducted in}} the coastal conditions at Jervis Bay. Three Pasquill stability categorisation schemes were compared. These indicated a predominance of neutral to slightly unstable conditions. During the daytime north bay breezes and north-east sea breezes were most common together with on-shore south-east <b>winds.</b> <b>Off-shore</b> south-west <b>winds</b> prevailed during winter and were observed most frequently at night...|$|R
500|$|The {{strength}} of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. [...] If an <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> of [...] exists, the sea breeze {{is not likely to}} develop. [...] At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean due to differences in their specific heat values, which forces the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. [...] If the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E

In 2013, a group of organizations, led by Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) started project FOWIND (Facilitating Offshore Wind in India) to identify potential zones for development of <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> power in India and to stimulate R & D activities in this area. [...] In 2014 FOWIND commissioned Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) to undertake pre-feasibility studies in [...] eight zones in Tamil Nadu which have been identified as having potential.|$|E
2500|$|Atlantic Wind Connection is a {{proposed}} electrical transmission backbone {{to be built}} off the Atlantic Coast of the United States to serve <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. [...] The transmission line, proposed by Trans-Elect Development Company, would deliver power ashore in southern Virginia, Delaware, southern New Jersey and northern New Jersey. As a {{first of its kind}} project, it poses significant risks of encountering unexpected technological challenges and cost overruns. Such an offshore backbone is an element in the national electric power strategy.|$|E
40|$|The aerosol in {{the coastal}} {{environment}} consists of a complicated mixture of anthropogenic and rural aerosol generated over land, and sea spray aerosol. Also, particles are generate dover sea by physical and chemical processes and the chemical composition may change due to condensation/evaporation of gaseous materials. The actual composition {{is a function of}} air mass history and fetch. At the land-sea transition the continental sources cease to exist, and thus the concentrations of land-based particles and gases will gradually decrease. At the same time, sea spray is generated due to the interaction between wind and waves in a developing wave field. A very intense source for sea spray aerosol is the surf zone. Consequently, the aerosol transported over sea in <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds</b> will abruptly charge at the land-sea transition and then gradually loose its continental character, while also the contribution of the surf-generated aerosol will decrease. The latter will be compensated, at least in part, by the production of sea spray aerosol. A Coastal Aerosol Transport model is being developed describing the evolution of the aerosol size distribution in an air column advected from the coast line over sea in <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds.</b> Both removal and production are taken into account. The result are applied to estimate the effect of the changing size distribution on the extinction coefficients. In this contribution, preliminary results are presented from a study {{of the effects of the}} surf-generated aerosol and the surface production...|$|R
40|$|Work {{done in the}} {{framework}} of the ASE subproject, topic 5, on factors determining particle dynamics over the air-sea interface, is briefly reviewed. Emphasis is on the cooperative efforts between the authors, covering a period of roughly 8 years, from 1988 until 1996 [1 – 16], which in part were carried out in cooperation with other institutes. The work has focused on the description of the aerosol life cycle in the marine atmosphere, including production of sea spray aerosol, transport of sea spray aerosol from the surface into the surface layer and the mixed layer, the dispersal of aerosol throughout the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), and the removal at the surface and {{at the top of the}} MABL. Continental aerosol, advected over the oceans in <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds,</b> is an important factor in the MABL, and processes involving aerosols of non-marine origin were included in our studies, in particular as regards their deposition on water surfaces...|$|R

2500|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} mechanism for rapid methane release. [...] As the Arctic Ocean {{becomes more and}} more ice free, the ocean absorbs more of the incident energy from the sun. The Arctic Ocean becomes warmer than the former ice cover and much more water vapour enters the air. [...] At times when the adjacent land is colder than the sea, this causes rising air above the sea and an <b>off-shore</b> <b>wind</b> as air over the land comes in to replace the rising air over the sea. [...] As the air rises, the dew point is reached and clouds form, releasing latent heat and further reinforcing the buoyancy of the air over the ocean. [...] All this results in air being drawn from the south across the tundra rather than the present situation of cold air flowing toward the south from the cold sinking air over the Arctic Ocean. [...] The extra heat being drawn from the south further accelerates the warming of the permafrost and the Arctic Ocean with increased release of methane.|$|E

40|$|Coastal polynyas {{are areas}} in an ice-covered ocean where the ice cover is exported, mostly by <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds.</b> The {{resulting}} reduction of sea ice enables an enhanced ocean-atmosphere heat transfer. Once the water temperatures {{are at the}} freezing point, further heat loss induces sea ice production. The heat exchange and ice production in coastal polynyas in the southwestern Weddell Sea is addressed using the Finite-Element Sea-ice Ocean Model, a primitive-equation, hydrostatic ocean circulation model coupled with a dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice model, which allows to quantify the amount of heat associated with cooling of the water column. Three important polynya regions are identified: at Brunt Ice Shelf, at Ronne Ice Shelf and along {{the southern part of}} the Antarctic Peninsula. Multiyear winter means (May–September 1990 – 2009) give an upward heat flux to the atmosphere of 311 W/m^ 2 in the Brunt polynyas, 511 W/m^ 2 in Ronne Polynya and 364 W/m^ 2 in the Antarctic Peninsula polynyas, whereof 57 W/m^ 2, 49 W/m^ 2 and 48 W/m^ 2, respectively, are supplied as oceanic heat flux from deeper layers. The mean winter sea ice production is 7. 2 cm/d in the Brunt polynyas corresponding to an ice volume of 1. 3 x 10 ^ 10 m^ 3 /winter, 13. 2 cm/d at Ronne polynya (4. 4 x 10 ^ 10 m^ 3 /winter), and 9. 2 cm/d in the Antarctic Peninsula polynyas (2. 1 x 10 ^ 10 m^ 3 /winter). The heat flux to the atmosphere inside polynyas is 7 to 9 times higher than the heat flux in the adjacent area; polynya ice production per unit area exceeds adjacent values by a factor of 9 to 14...|$|R
5000|$|An {{oceanic climate}} {{prevails}} from the Pyrenees to the Asturias, area which incorporating Galicia {{is sometimes called}} [...] "Green Spain", characterised by relatively mild winters and warm summers. The climate and landscape {{are determined by the}} Atlantic Ocean winds whose moisture gets trapped by the mountains circumventing the Spanish Atlantic coast. Because of the Foehn effect, the southern slopes fall inside the rain shadow zone and so Green Spain contrasts starkly with the rest of Spain. But the summers remain warmer than many comparable North-west European regions (about 21 C in July in Santander versus 16 C in Brest or Liverpool). The rainfall is generally abundant, exceeding 1000 mm and is fairly evenly spread out over the year, with the driest month above 30 mm, which is the minimum criteria for an oceanic climate according to Köppen. Although Köppen officially limits the oceanic domain to the Asturias and the Basque Country region, certain authors such as Trewartha prefer to extend this climatic zone to the north-west part of the peninsula to Galicia, due to the moderate summer temperatures.Temperatures vary only slightly, both on a diurnal and a seasonal basis, and averages range from 9 C in January to 21 C in July. The moderating effects of the sea are less prominent further inland, where temperatures are more extreme than those on the coast. Distance from the Atlantic Ocean also has an effect on precipitation levels, so there is less rainfall in the east than in the west. Autumn (October to December) is the wettest season, while July is the driest month. The high humidity and the prevailing <b>off-shore</b> <b>winds</b> make fog and mist common along the north west coast; this phenomenon is less frequent a short distance inland because the mountains form a barrier to the maritime moisture.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{coastline}} {{at the western}} end of the Bristol Channel faces west towards the Atlantic Ocean meaning that a combination of an <b>off-shore</b> (east) <b>wind</b> and a generous Atlantic swell produces excellent surf along the beaches. The heritage coasts of the Vale of Glamorgan, Bideford Bay and Gower are, along with the Atlantic coasts of Pembrokeshire and Cornwall, the key areas for surfing in the whole of Britain. Although slightly overshadowed by the Atlantic coasts of North Cornwall and West Pembrokeshire, both Gower and Bideford Bay nevertheless have several superb breaks—notably Croyde in Bideford Bay and Langland Bay on Gower—and surfing in Gower and Bideford Bay is enhanced by the golden beaches, clean blue waters, excellent water quality and good facilities close by to the main surf breaks.|$|R

The simulation of <b>off-shore</b> turbulent <b>wind</b> speed was achieved by programming in MATLAB. The brandish dis-placement, the Mises stress distribution and nonlinear dynamic response curves were obtained.

The region of the maximum displacement and maximum stress and their variations at different blade posi-tions are revealed. It was shown that the contribution of turbulence effect (TE) on dis-placement and stress is smaller than that of the FSI effect, and its extent of contribution is related to the relative span length. In addition, it was concluded that the simulation considering bidirectional FSI (BFSI) can reflect the vibration characteristics of wind tur-bine blades more accurately...|$|R
50|$|Berg {{winds are}} usually {{accompanied}} by coastal lows. These coastal lows owe their existence to {{the configuration of}} the plateau, escarpment and coastal plain (see diagram on the right, above), in that they are confined to the coastal areas, always below the escarpment. Though they can arise almost anywhere along the coast, they often first appear on the west coast, or even on the Namibian coast. They are then always propagated counter-clockwise along South Africa's coastline at between 30-60 km/h, from the west coast southwards to the Cape Peninsula and then eastward along the south coast, and finally north-eastward along the KwaZuluNatal coastline, to finally dissipate north of Durban, due to the divergence of the coastline from the plateau which disappears altogether {{in the vicinity of the}} Limpopo valley. There is always a hot <b>off-shore</b> berg <b>wind</b> ahead of a coastal low, which can blow for several days or for only for a few hours. This is then followed by cool onshore winds which bring low cloud, fog or drizzle to the region, but may, on occasions, produce substantial precipitation when coupled to an approaching cold front.|$|R

Events that resulted in synoptic-scale offshore flow {{over most of the}} Central Californian coast were identified and considered for this study throughout the late spring through early fall 2006 season. A total of 18 events were found along the central coast during this time frame. Two cases were selected from the 18 events for detailed analyses by examining the cross-coast offshore winds, length of duration, the degree of marine boundary layer compression, and westward migration of coastal jet. Results indicate changes in the California Coast Jet are dominantly influenced by two major processes: subsidence due to increase of low to mid-level thickness above the boundary layer and downsloping winds directly above the marine boundary layer from flow over Coastal Mountain Ranges. Both processes lead to compression of the marine boundary layer near coast, increasing the east-west thermal gradient in the inversion above the marine boundary layer causing the coastal jet to migrate westward near the tightest temperature and pressure gradient.
