30|$|A 2 -year-old girl {{presented}} with rash <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> and extremities for 4  days. Firstly the rash began as multiple vesicles <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> and extremities and then changed into erythematous papules and crust on top. She {{has been in}} contact with two friends who had the same rash at school. She was diagnosed as chickenpox infection from a doctor. Physical examination demonstrated dry erythematous papules on arms, legs and buttock with some desquamation <b>on</b> <b>buttock.</b> Few red macules were present on soles. No buccal and trunk lesions were detected (Figure  3 b). The cutaneous lesions in this case were presented as Gianotti–Crosti syndrome (GCS)-like because GCS is characterized by monomorphous lichenoid papules and/or papulovesicles, symmetrically distributed on the face, arms and legs with relative sparing of the trunk. However, the lesions in this case disappeared in a week.|$|E
40|$|Proliferating trichilemmal cyst (PTC) is {{a benign}} adnexal {{tumors of the}} skin, related to the isthmus of the hair folicle. PTC was {{described}} {{for the first time}} 1966 by Wilson-Jone, as "proliferating epidermoid custs". Usually the lesion is encountered on the scalp; but wrist, elbow, mons pubis, vula, buttock, and chest are locations where it can be foubd. Malignant transformation has rarely been report these lesions. Treatment mainly entails wide local surgiucal excision. We report a case of 30 years-old women, with small PTC <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> areas, treated with topical urea and salicylic acid peeling. Keratolytic action of urea can be used in the treatment of PTC, WHEN THEY ARE AMALL IN SIZE, AND SPREAD OVER A LARGE AREA, WICH IS'S NO POSSBLE PERFORM A SURGICAL EXCISION...|$|E
40|$|Histoid leprosy is a {{distinct}} variant of lepromatous leprosy. It presents clinically as well demarcated cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules similar to dermatofibroma. A 40 year old male, presented with multiple progressive skin lesions <b>on</b> <b>buttock,</b> trunk, face, back and extremities of six months duration. Examination findings revealed multiple, irregular, bilateral, symmetrical shiny cutaneous nodules over the above mentioned sites. Radial, ulnar, radial cutaneous and lateral popliteal nerve thickening was seen. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed features of histoid leprosy, which was confirmed by histopathology. Modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain for Acid fast bacilli was positive. Bacterial index was 6 +. Histoid leprosy is an unusual variant of lepromatous leprosy. The identification of histoid leprosy and differentiation of it from lepromatous leprosy helps to facilitate the follow up of patients {{with regards to the}} drug sensitivity, relapse and reaction. We present here the role of FNAC in the diagnosis of histoid leprosy...|$|E

40|$|Wheelchair-dependent {{subjects}} often adopt {{a passive}} sitting posture and suffer from sitting acquired pressure ulcers (PU) that mainly occur when high buttock pressures sustain {{for a longer}} period of time. Body posture directly influences seating load and proper postural change is therefore essential. Many subjects cannot reposition themselves and seating systems that adjust sitting posture can regulate seating load and potentially diminish the risk to develop PU. We describe a mechanism for postural adjustments and investigated the influence of seat inclination (1), pelvis rotation (2) and chair recline (3) <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> load. We developed an experimental simulator chair containing the concept to adjust body posture in the sagittal plane. Measurements involved quasi-static actuated chair movements in which chair configuration, buttock interface pressure and seating forces were simultaneously measured. Significant effects with high coefficients of determination (r 2 > 0. 8) were found for seating force, centre of pressure and sacral load. We conclude that a combination of independent pelvis rotation and seat inclination is effective to regulate the net buttock shear force and the sacral interface pressure in healthy subjects. Whether both techniques are also applicable in subjects without postural stability is still to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} effects of {{backrest}} inclination of a wheelchair <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> pressures in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients and normal subjects. Method The participants were 22 healthy subjects and 22 SCI patients. Buttock pressures {{of the participants were}} measured by a Tekscan ® pressure sensing mat and software while they were sitting in a reclining wheelchair. Buttock pressures were recorded for 90 °, 100 °, 110 °, 120 ° and 130 ° seat-to-back angles at the ischial tuberosity (IT) and sacrococcygeal (SC) areas. Recordings were made at each angle over four seconds at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. Results The side-to-side buttock pressure differences in the IT area for the SCI patients was significantly greater than for the normal subjects. There {{was no significant difference between}} the SCI patients and the normal subjects in the buttock pressure change pattern of the IT area. Significant increases in pressure on the SC area were found as backrest inclination angle was changed to 90 o, 100 o and 110 ° in the normal subjects, but no significant differences were found in the SCI patients. Conclusion Most of the SCI patients have freeform posture in wheelchairs, and this leads to an uneven distribution of buttock pressure. In the SCI patients, the peak pressure in the IT area reduced as the backrest angle was increased, but peak pressure at the SC area remained relatively unchanged. To reduce buttock pressure and prevent pressure ulcers and enhance ulcer healing, it can be helpful for tetraplegic patients, to have wheelchai...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIncreasing obesity {{prevalence}} {{and development of}} bariatric surgery {{have led to the}} development of skin re-draping techniques. Several contouring techniques have been described for treating the circumferential excess of the lower trunk. We performed a systematic review to summarize surgical indications, operative techniques, peri-operative management (nutritional supplementation, antibiotic prophylaxis, thrombo-prophylaxis), outcomes, complications, patient satisfaction, and impact on quality of life of circumferential contouring of the lower trunk procedures. A systematic review, based on the PRISMA criteria, was conducted using the Pubmed and Cochrane databases. The review included 42 articles and 1748 operated patients. Two studies only were graded as level of evidence II; the others were graded as levels III to V. The most frequently reported indication was massive weight loss. All the described techniques derived either from belt lipectomy or lower bodylift. Belt lipectomy resulted in a posterior scar situated at the waistline and allowed a better correction of hip back rolls, whereas lower bodylift was more effective <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> and lateral thigh ptosis. The most reported complication was wound dehiscence. Patient satisfaction and quality of life scores were high in all studies. This review included a majority of low-level evidence studies that limit extrapolability of the results. Future randomized prospective studies may generate stronger evidence, with a standardization of surgical indications and operative techniques. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

40|$|Leprosy (Hansen’s disease) is {{a chronic}} granulomatous {{infectious}} disease that primarily affects the peripheral nerves, skin, {{upper respiratory tract}} mucosa, eyes and certain other tissues. It is diagnosable and curable if recognized early and treated adequately. A twenty nine-year-old male from Jessore, Bangladesh reported in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh with the complaints of multiple erythematous, large, raised and circumscribed lesions with loss of sensations on {{different parts of the}} body, especially distal portions of all four limbs for last eight months. Subsequently he developed ulcers on the anesthetic fingers due to smoking and few ulcerative lesions on both feet. Skin examination revealed multiple erythematous, large nodular lesions {{on both sides of the}} cheek and forehead, multiple erythematous, indurated, large plaques with raised margin and central clearing on the trunk, waist and all four limbs, few satellite lesions around the large plaques on the trunk, few hypopigmented patches and plaques <b>on</b> <b>buttock</b> and lower limbs, multiple painless ulcers on dorsal surface of fingers of both hands, both lateral malleoluses and right sole. On examination of peripheral nerves, left great auricular nerve, both ulnar nerves and both common peroneal nerves were moderately enlarged and tender. Slit skin smear for AFB (modified Z-N stain) was done and revealed that there were large number of acid and alcohol-fast bacilli arranged in straight and curved parallel bundles with globular masses (cigar-bundle appearance), morphologically resembling Mycobacterium leprae. Skin biopsy for histopathological examination revealed extensive infiltration of macrophages in the dermis, separated from epidermis by narrow grenz zone, with destruction of skin adnexa. Few foci of poorly defined granuloma in dermis were also noted. The patient was managed with rifampicin, clofazimine, dapsone, prednisolone and omeprazole...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pressure {{distributions}} <b>on</b> the <b>buttocks</b> {{and thighs}} by the functional electrical stimulation on the gluteus maximus, sartorius and hamstring in the seating posture were analyzed for ten healthy young volunteers {{in order to}} determine which muscle can be stimulated for pressure ulcer prevention. Muscles were stimulated every 5 seconds over 30 seconds by the MP 150 stimulator. Pressure distribution and ground reaction forces <b>on</b> the stimulated <b>buttocks</b> and thighs increased when the gluteus maximus was stimulated. Pressure on the stimulated thigh slightly decreased when stimulating sartorius and hamstring individually. With a simultaneous stimulation of the gluteus maximus and sartorius, pressures <b>on</b> the stimulated <b>buttocks</b> and thighs increased significantly, but pressure <b>on</b> the opposite <b>buttock</b> decreased significantly. With a simultaneous stimulation of the sartorius and hamstring, both pressure on the stimulated thigh and the ground reaction force significantly decreased...|$|R
