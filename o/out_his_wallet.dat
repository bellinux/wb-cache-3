500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{would open}} his [...] "tripe and keister" [...] (display case on a tripod) {{on a busy}} street corner. Piling {{ordinary}} soap cakes onto the keister top, he began expounding on their wonders. As {{he spoke to the}} growing crowd of curious onlookers, he would pull <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and begin wrapping paper money, ranging from one dollar up to one hundred dollars, around a select few of the bars. [...] He then finished each bar by wrapping plain paper around it to hide the money.|$|E
2500|$|Larey {{then picked}} up Hollis' pants and pulled <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and told the assailant, [...] "He doesn't have any money." [...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
50|$|Wizzrobes are magic-using enemies. They attack Link with {{different}} magical attacks, including ice and fire, and can sometimes suck Link's Rupees <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> In The Wind Waker, they resemble robed, anthropomorphic toucans, {{and are able}} to summon other monsters to fight for them, although only the Mighty Wizzrobe can summon stronger creatures.|$|R
60|$|Henry got {{the letter}} <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> {{and said he}} would skip some of the private phrases, if we were willing; then he went on and read the bulk of it--a loving, sedate, and {{altogether}} charming and gracious piece of handiwork, with a postscript full of affectionate regards and messages to Tom, and Joe, and Charley, and other close friends and neighbors.|$|R
50|$|Fred seizes his chance, {{and heads}} down to Blandings posing as Glossop, with Pongo {{playing the role}} of his {{secretary}} and nephew, and Polly his daughter Gwendolyne. They meet Glossop on the train, but head him off, only to pass him into the hands of Rupert Baxter, now working for the Duke. Arriving at Blandings, they are met by Lord Bosham, who was conned <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> by Uncle Fred the previous day.|$|R
60|$|Marston took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> {{and after}} giving Wyndham some money {{went back to}} Peters, whose eyes twinkled.|$|E
60|$|That gentleman, in silence, took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> {{extracted}} a note therefrom, {{and handed it}} gravely to the Story Girl.|$|E
6000|$|Alton took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> [...] "He {{can have}} two hundred if he likes. Now I {{want you to}} fix it up without telling Miss Townshead or anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|The gleeman took a loaf {{and some}} strips of cold fried bacon <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and laid them upon the ground. 'I {{will give a}} tithe to the poor,' says he, and he cut a tenth part from the loaf and the bacon. 'Who among you is the poorest?' And thereupon was a great clamour, for the beggars began {{the history of their}} sorrows and their poverty, and their yellow faces swayed like Gara Lough when the floods have filled it with water from the bogs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{young woman}} comes {{home to a}} half-empty apartment, and she feels alone. An older man walks through the {{corridors}} of a half-empty airport, and he feels alone and sad. He takes a photograph <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> tears it in two and drops it on the moving walkway. Both are torn in two. A girl in Paris is alone with a cat. A man arrives in Warsaw, and a woman is there to meet him. She drives him to his parent's home. An accident, a murderâ€”nothing alters the imperturable course of life.|$|R
50|$|Vijay Kumar is a well-off {{business}} industrialist {{who lives}} in Bombay in a palatial house. One day he returns home and finds <b>out</b> that <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> has been stolen. Unknown to him, <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> has {{ended up with a}} petty thief and pick-pocket named Vikram, who, in a drunken state, gives the wallet along with the money in it to a beggar woman named Usha Rani. Vijay does not know that this theft will turn his life upside down; re-unite him with his long-lost mother & brother; as well as put the lives of everyone he knows at risk at the hands of powerful gangster, Tejaa, who will leave no stone unturned to destroy Vijay and whoever comes in his way.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{the one to}} go, so that settles it," [...] the miner said as {{he pulled}} <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> [...] "Here's what money I've got, an' if more's needed let me know." ...|$|E
60|$|He took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> {{and held}} up the checks, keeping, however, {{a firm grip on}} them, because he knew that if Carmen meant to fight for her lover she would not be scrupulous.|$|E
60|$|Rollo then recollected {{that he had}} {{his ticket}} in his wallet. So, after fumbling {{for a time in}} his pocket, he brought <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and {{produced}} the ticket, and handed it to the clerk.|$|E
60|$|He {{took off}} his broad hat when the others alighted, and Miss Deringham noticed there was a trace of courtliness in his simplicity. Then he strode past her father, who was taking {{something}} <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and swung himself lightly into the wagon. He spoke to the team, there was a creak and rattle, and next moment the vehicle was lurching down the trail. Deringham stood still a moment, his fingers inside the wallet and mild wonder in his eyes, and then smiled a little as his daughter turned towards him. There was a faint pink flush of anger in her cheeks.|$|R
50|$|In Uncle Fred in the Springtime, when we next meet him, he cons slow-minded Lord Bosham <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> {{just for}} the sake of it, and heads merrily down to Blandings Castle in the guise of Sir Roderick Glossop, with Pongo taking the role of his nephew and secretary, Basil. While there, he wraps up the affairs of Polly and her man, and Pongo's money worries, with a panache only Gally himself could rival; he even avoids <b>his</b> wife finding <b>out</b> he has left home while she was away (tending her sick mother in the South of France), despite the wrath of his niece Valerie.|$|R
60|$|But poor Molinda merely cried. Then {{his majesty}} was almost driven {{to say that}} he would give the reward to whoever {{produced}} the hoofs by that day week. But no sooner had he said this than the prince brought them <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and displayed them in open Court. This ended the case; and Benson, after being entertained with sherry and sandwiches in the steward's room, was sent back to his master, And I regret to say that his temper was not at all improved by his failure to better himself. On the contrary, he was unusually cross and disagreeable for several days; but we must, perhaps, make some allowance for his disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure; I'd ruther hev {{the change}} than the bill," [...] he answered, taking <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> [...] "But I wouldn't send {{so much money}} in a letter, if I was you. Better buy a post-office order." ...|$|E
60|$|Stormont pulled <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> {{and then}} Thirlwell came near to betraying himself, because the {{dramatic}} surprise {{was almost too}} much for his self-control. Drummond snatched the bills from the other's hand and laughed, a savage, scornful laugh.|$|E
60|$|For some miles his road lay {{through a}} wood, {{and when he}} left it he {{suddenly}} came out on a bare hillside. Here he sat down to rest, and pulling <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> prepared to eat his dinner.|$|E
50|$|Several motivations {{were under}} investigation. The police ruled <b>out</b> robbery as <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> was still with his body. The police {{originally}} believed his murder {{might have been}} politically motivation. Another reason {{may have been a}} discussion that took place between Lima and these men in the vicinity of a school. And still another point of investigation centered around an altercation Lima may have had with the men at a gas station minutes before his death. His death has also come along with other murders of Guatemalan journalists.|$|R
60|$|He put up <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> {{a little}} awkwardly, and held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand more awkwardly.|$|R
60|$|While Mr. George {{was saying}} this, he took <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> pocket, and {{opened to the}} {{compartment}} of it which contained napoleons.|$|R
60|$|So Rollo and Charles {{got into}} the {{carriage}} again. Rollo took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and made a memorandum {{of the name of}} the shop where he had engaged the sash, and of the street and number. The coachman sat quietly upon his seat, waiting for Rollo to finish his writing, and expecting then to receive directions where he was to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps this is it, then," [...] said Rollo. And so saying, he took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and there, {{from one}} of the inner compartments, where his uncle George had placed it away very carefully, he {{produced}} a paper. The chambermaid opened it, saying, [...] "Yes, this is all right. Berths sixteen and eighteen. Come with me, and I'll show you where they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Barnaby; [...] "I have it here {{safe and}} sound, {{and see it}} you shall." [...] And thereupon and without more ado he fetched <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> opened it, and handed his {{interlocutor}} the mysterious note he had received the day or two before. Whereupon the other, drawing to him the candle, burning there {{for the convenience of}} those who would smoke tobacco, began immediately reading it.|$|E
60|$|He stole down a lane, {{where as}} yet no people were stirring, and crept along, {{leaning on his}} staff, till {{he came to the}} eastern gate, {{at the back of the}} city, which the Greeks never attacked, for they had never drawn their army in a circle round the town. There Ulysses {{explained}} to the sentinels that he had gathered food enough to last for a long journey to some other town, and opened his bag, which seemed full of bread and broken meat. The soldiers said he was a lucky beggar, and let him out. He walked slowly along the waggon road by which wood was brought into Troy from the forests on Mount Ida, and when he found that nobody was within sight he slipped into the forest, and stole into a dark thicket, hiding beneath the tangled boughs. Here he lay and slept till evening, and then took the new clothes which Helen had given him <b>out</b> of <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and put them on, and threw the belt of the sword over his shoulder, and hid the Luck of Troy in his bosom. He washed himself clean in a mountain brook, and now all who saw him must have known that he was no beggar, but Ulysses of Ithaca, Laertes' son.|$|R
60|$|After supper, {{and another}} social chat and smoke, {{we went to}} our room together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{enormous}} tobacco <b>wallet,</b> and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, {{and said it was}} mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets. I let them stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> idol, and removed the paper firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.|$|R
60|$|They reburied {{the chest}} {{in the place}} whence they had taken it, and then the Parson folded the {{precious}} paper of directions, placed it carefully in <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> in <b>his</b> pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Barnaby; [...] "I have it here {{safe and}} sound, and you shall see it." [...] And thereupon and without more ado he drew <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> opened it, {{and handed the}} other the mysterious note which he had kept {{carefully}} by him ever since he had received it. His interlocutor took the paper, and drawing to him the candle, burning there {{for the convenience of}} those who would smoke tobacco, began immediately reading it.|$|E
60|$|I {{forget what}} I answered--we {{were always a}} hot-blooded race--but I fancy that several {{adjectives}} and the word hypocrite figured therein; while Coombs, shaken out of his usual assumption of ironical courtesy, made a serious mistake when he tried bullying. As he strode toward me, fuming like an irate turkey cock, in an absurdly helpless attitude, I grasped his shoulder and backed him violently against a stall. Then, and whether this was justifiable I do not know, though I know that otherwise not a cent would I ever have got, I took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> which, {{as he had been}} selling stock in Brandon, contained a roll of dollar bills, and counted out the covenanted hire.|$|E
50|$|Kate goes to Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) {{and says}} the case {{contains}} weapons. It belonged to the U.S. Marshal that was escorting her to the United States and the key is buried with him. They dig up the body and Kate pulls <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> Before giving it to Jack, she palms the key, but he catches her.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>wallet</b> {{had many}} little matters in it mingled with small coins, {{and he had}} the usual {{difficulty}} in laying his finger on the right thing. He unhooked <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and turned <b>out</b> the contents on Tessa's lap. Among them was his onyx ring.|$|R
6000|$|They reburied {{the chest}} {{in the place}} whence they had taken it, and then the parson folded the {{precious}} paper of directions, placed it carefully in <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> and <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> in <b>his</b> pocket. [...] "Tom," [...] he said, for the twentieth time, [...] "your fortune has been made this day." ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor, {{unable to}} refuse, seated {{himself in the}} shaving-chair, trembling, half with fear and half with rage, and by this time quite {{unconscious}} of the lather which Nello had laid on with such profuseness. He deposited his medicine-case on <b>his</b> knees, took <b>out</b> <b>his</b> precious spectacles (wondrous Florentine device!) from <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> lodged them carefully above his flat nose and high ears, and lifting up his brows, turned towards the applicant.|$|R
