25|$|Regular NJRR service began September 15, 1834 between Newark and Jersey City, using a {{temporary}} track over Bergen Hill. An extension to Elizabeth opened December 21, 1835, using the turnpike {{from the south}} end of Broad Street. Service to Rahway began January 1, 1836, again along the turnpike from a point south of Elizabeth. Locomotives were only used south of Newark until January 11, though some horse power operations continued east of Newark. The line opened to east of New Brunswick July 11, with an <b>omnibus</b> <b>transfer</b> the rest of the way; the turnpike was used north of Iselin. On September 8, 1836 the NJRR acquired a majority of stock of the New Brunswick Bridge Company to avoid its local monopoly over crossings of the Raritan River. The double-deck bridge over the Raritan opened October 31, 1837, with a road beneath the railroad, taking the NJRR to New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Bridge Company was authorized to charge a toll on the lower level on May 7, 1838. The old 1795 Albany Street Bridge was removed in 1849, but was later rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|Southern National {{was formed}} to improve {{co-ordination}} of road and rail passenger services in the operating area of the Southern Railway. The railway had very little involvement in bus services, but the National <b>Omnibus</b> <b>transferred</b> its operations in the operating area to the new company. The result was an operating territory split into two areas: Dorset (based at Weymouth) and north Devon and north Cornwall (based at Barnstaple). The two areas were separated by the operating territories of Devon General and Western National.|$|R
