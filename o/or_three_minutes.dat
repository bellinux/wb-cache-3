5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E

50|$|All {{branches}} are terminating in cone-like inflorescences, 1.5-3 cm long. Cymes {{consist of}} (two <b>or)</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> flowers that are sunk in the axil of each opposite bract. The bisexual flowers are free. The connate tepals {{are reduced to}} a minute membranous lobe or sometimes absent, especially in fruit. There is only one stamen and an ovary with two stigmas.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are pale stone grey with minute sprinkling of tawny fuscous, especially across the apical {{fourth of the}} wing, at the commencement {{of which is a}} minute ochreous costal spot and another opposite to it on the dorsum, the latter encircled above by tawny fuscous scales. Along the termen are two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> groups of black scales. The hindwings are pale stone grey.|$|R
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the action, monitor Tecumseh moved past the fort and toward Tennessee, {{apparently}} in obedience to that part of her orders. Commander Tunis A. M. Craven either disregarded or forgot the instruction to stay to the east of the minefield, so he took his ship directly across. Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 11:00a.m., {{the event}} went on an {{unscheduled}} break {{due to a}} technical problem. At 10:58a.m. PST, Farook and Malik, armed with semi-automatic pistols and rifles, fired five shots, killing two people outside the building. Farook then entered a minute later and opened fire on those in attendance, followed quickly by Malik. They wore ski masks and black tactical gear (including load-bearing vests holding magazines and ammunition), but not ballistic or bulletproof vests. The entire shooting took two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes,</b> during which the shooters fired more than 100 bullets before fleeing.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm {{for males and}} 16 mm for females. The forewings are ochreous-brownish with the plical and second discal stigmata minute and dark fuscous. There are small fine oblique marks of fuscous irroration from the costa about one-third and the middle, as well as very fine linear interneural blackish marginal marks around the posterior part of the costa and apex, and two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> dots on the termen. The hindwings are dark grey.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Shorea materialis. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a linear gallery {{occurring}} on the lower surface of the leaf and running mostly along leaf-veins. When it reaches the leaf-margin, it is broadened along the margin to form an elongate blotch. When full-grown, the mining part of the leaf is folded downward. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. The cocoon is boat shaped, ochreous in colour, and covered by two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> bubbles on the upper surface.|$|R
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or {{any other part of}} the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
25|$|From 1977 {{served in}} Northern Ireland both as {{intelligence}} officer and, after attending Staff College, Camberley and promotion to major on 30 September 1981, company commander of A Company 1 CHESHIRE, with an intermediate period spent at RMA Sandhurst as an instructor. During {{his time in}} Northern Ireland he was the Incident Commander at the Droppin Well bombing in Ballykelly which killed seventeen people. Stewart heard the explosion and arrived at the scene two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> later. Six of the dead soldiers were from his company, including his clerk and storeman. He received a personal commendation from the General commanding in Northern Ireland for his actions on the day.|$|E
25|$|James Mahon, an apothecary, gave {{evidence}} that he lived {{at the corner of}} Bow Street. Coming through the piazzas in Covent-Garden, he heard two pistols go off. Going back, he saw a gentleman lying on the ground, with a pistol in his left hand, beating himself violently and bleeding copiously. The prisoner was the gentleman. Mahon had taken the pistol away from him and given it to the constable, asking him to take the prisoner to his house for the wound to be dressed. He had seen nothing of the lady until two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> later he saw her lying at the bar, with a mortal wound, and said he could not help her.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings are white sprinkled fuscous, the costal edge blackish towards the base, there is minute blackish costal dot near the base. The stigmata are black, the discal moderate, remote, the plical small, obliquely beyond the first discal, a small blackish dot {{at the end}} of the fold, slightly before the second discal. There is an inwards-oblique triangular blotch of fuscous suffusion from the costa at three-fourths, its apex touching the second discal. There are two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> black dots near before the lower part of the termen. The hindwings are pale grey.|$|R

5000|$|In Naked City's {{characteristic}} early style, {{songs were}} often performed at astonishingly fast tempos, drawing on thrash metal and hardcore punk's emphasis on extreme speed. Many songs were quite brief, and typically switched musical genres every few measures. One critic described the band's music as [...] "jump-cutting micro-collages of hardcore, country, sleazy jazz, covers of John Barry and Ornette Coleman, brief abstract tussles — a whole city crammed into two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> bursts". This fast-change tendency was inspired {{in part by}} Carl Stalling — a Zorn favorite — who wrote music for many Warner Brothers cartoons, that featured frequent shifts in tempo, theme and style.|$|R
25|$|After {{the above}} process, the yerba may be brewed. If the straw is {{inserted}} into dry yerba, the mate {{must first be}} filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes {{no more than two}} <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes).</b> Treating the yerba with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the yerba mate from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the yerba, until it reaches almost {{to the top of the}} gourd when the yerba is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the yerba beside the edge of the gourd's opening.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Sunday 30 May, Ciudad de Barcelona was {{off the coast of}} Malgrat, about 60 kilometres north of Barcelona. She was spotted by the Italian submarine General Sanjuro, which was under the command of captain Pablo Suances Jaudenes. The submarine was originally named Torricelli and transferred to the Spanish nationalist navy in April 1937. General Sanjuro was seeking revenge for the Germans, as the cruiser Deutschland was hit by the Republican airplanes in the port of Ibiza a week earlier. The attack killed 31 German sailors. The submarine launched two torpedoes. The first one missed and landed to the beach of Lloret de Mar. Captain Nadal tried a desperate maneuver by turning Ciudad de Barcelona towards Malgrat, in order to save the passengers, but at 6 PM she was hit by another torpedo which exploded in the engine room. At the time, the ship was only 400 metres off the shore. Ciudad de Barcelona sank rapidly, in just two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E
60|$|Cirri, {{extremely}} long, but slightly curled, {{capable of}} being protruded so as almost to touch {{the base of the}} peduncle or the surface of attachment; segments short, extraordinarily numerous. In the three posterior cirri (excepting the rudimentary rami), each segment supports two long, slightly serrated spines, with two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> intermediate ones, and with one or two very short, thick spines on the inner and upper lateral margins: dorsal tufts with only two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> long, fine, unequal spines. All the segments are extremely flat, broad, short, with their anterior faces not protuberant; the greater number of the segments, especially the lower ones, have very obscure articulations, to be seen only with a high power, and these can be capable of little or no movement.|$|R
60|$|Cirri.--In {{the three}} {{posterior}} pair, the segments have their bristles {{arranged in a}} transverse row, either {{in the form of}} a narrow brush, or consisting only of a single pair with two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute,</b> intermediate, and lateral marginal spines. The anterior ramus of the second cirrus is thicker, and more thickly clothed with spines than is the posterior ramus: this latter ramus, however, and both rami of the third cirrus, are rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior pair. The unique case in A. cornuta of the inner rami of the fifth and sixth cirri being rudimentary (Pl. X, fig. 28) will be minutely described under that species.|$|R

500|$|Just after 3pm, {{minutes after}} the lunch had ended, the Yugoslav Air Force {{attacked}} the Banski dvori and other targets in the Gornji Grad area of Zagreb {{and elsewhere in the}} Croatian capital city, two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> after everyone had left the hall where the lunch was hosted. Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets, however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s carrying eight Munja [...] unguided missiles each and two Soko G-4 Super Galebs carrying two Mark 82 bombs each. The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by proximity fuzes [...] above the target, scoring two direct hits.|$|E

The guns could {{penetrate}} 11 inches of armour {{at a range}} of their [...] shells had a muzzle velocity of [...] Their rate of fire was very slow, about one round every 10 minutes. The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together. Each turntable took about two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> to rotate 180°. Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak; {{so much so that}} the gun's recoil could cause them to rotate, leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired. Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem, but the myth persisted.|$|E
500|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, with Kouma manning the M2 Browning [...]50-caliber machine gun atop the tank. As the gunner fired the tank's main cannon, Kouma sank many of the boats attempting to cross the river with his machine gun. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks heard over the field telephone that the company was withdrawing and that they should do likewise. Kouma instead opted to act as a rearguard to cover the infantry. He was wounded shortly thereafter in the foot reloading the tank's ammunition. He quickly fought off another North Korean attack across the river with his machine gun.|$|E

500|$|In early 2003, [...] {{while in}} Los Angeles {{and before they}} met with {{producer}} Gregg Hoffman, Hoffman's friend pulled him {{into his office and}} showed him the short. Hoffman said, [...] "About two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> into it, my jaw hit the floor." [...] He quickly showed the short and script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules of Evolution Entertainment. They later formed Twisted Pictures as a horror genre production label. The producers read the screenplay that night and two days later offered Wan and Whannell creative control and 25% of the net profits. Even though Wan and Whannell received [...] "better offers" [...] from studios like DreamWorks and Gold Circle Films, they were not willing to chance Wan's directing and Whannell acting in the lead role. In order to finance the film, Hoffman, Burg, and Koules put up a second mortgage on their Highland Avenue headquarters. Saw was given a production budget of between $1 million and $1.2 million.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 1918, {{the whole}} of No.80 Wing RAF—of which No.4 Squadron was part—took to the sky {{in an effort to}} [...] "harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road" [...] and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze. A {{formation}} of Sopwith Snipes from No.4 Squadron had been utilised as an escort when the initial raid was carried out, and then to protect the bombers as they returned to the Allied lines. However, when the Australians had executed the latter duty, they were tailed by a patrol of twelve Fokkers. After seeing the bombers off, the Snipes wheeled around to confront the German aircraft. The battle raged for two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that three pilots were missing; Baker was among the three. Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant Arthur Palliser were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to Rittmeister Karl Bolle during the battle.|$|E
500|$|Chilton took up {{electric}} guitar at thirteen, playing along with Beatles songs, later saying, [...] "I really loved the mid-sixties British pop music [...] all {{two and a}} half minutes <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> long, really appealing songs. So I've always aspired to that same format, that's what I like. Not to mention the rhythm and blues and the Stax stuff, too". Chilton abandoned his guitar-playing when with The Box Tops, then took up the instrument again; he met Roger McGuinn, guitarist for the Byrds, and developed particular interest in {{electric guitar}} and acoustic folk. Stephens enjoyed the music of Otis Redding, the Isley Brothers, the Who, the Kinks, and especially the Beatles. Hummel likewise was a member of more than one band during his early musical years, again influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion acts. The bassist also played acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment, following the styles of Simon & Garfunkel and Joni Mitchell and using finger-picking techniques to play folk and bluegrass. Most songs on the first three albums are credited to either Bell/Chilton or Chilton, but some credit Hummel, Stephens and others, as either writer or co-writer. At the only seven live performances in the original era, the last of which took place before the second album's release, all four members contributed vocally.|$|E
