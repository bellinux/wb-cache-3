40|$|Night-time ozone {{deposition}} for a Scots {{pine forest}} in Southern Finland was {{studied at the}} SMEAR II measurement station by evaluating the turbulent eddy covariance (EC), storage change and vertical advection fluxes. Similarly to night-time carbon dioxide flux, the eddy-covariance flux of ozone was decreasing with turbulence intensity (friction velocity), and storage change of the compound did not compensate the reduction (well-known night-time measurement problem). Accounting for vertical advection resulted in invariance of ozone deposition rate on turbulence intensity. This was also demonstrated for carbon dioxide, verified by independent measurements of NEE by chamber systems. The result {{highlights the importance of}} advection when considering the exchange measurements of any scalar. Analysis of aerodynamic and laminar boundary layer resistances by the model approach indicated that the surface resistance and/or chemical sink strength was limiting ozone deposition. The possible aerial <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> by known fast chemical reactions with sesquiterpenes and NO explain only a minor fraction of <b>ozone</b> <b>sink.</b> Thus the deposition is controlled either by stomatal uptake or surface reactions or both of them, the mechanisms not affected by turbulence intensity. Therefore invariance of deposition flux on turbulence intensity is expected also from resistance and chemical sink analysis...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{tropospheric ozone}} {{concentrations}} {{are considered a}} toxic threat to plants, responsible for global crop losses with associated economic costs of several billion dollars per year. Plant injuries {{have been linked to}} the uptake of ozone through stomatal pores and oxidative damage of the internal leaf tissue. But a striking question remains: can surface reactions limit the stomatal uptake of ozone and therefore reduce its detrimental effects to plants? In this laboratory study we could show that semi-volatile organic compounds exuded by the glandular trichomes of different Nicotiana tabacum varieties are an efficient <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> at the plant surface. In our experiments, different diterpenoid compounds were responsible for a strongly variety-dependent ozone uptake of plants under dark conditions, when stomatal pores are almost closed. Surface reactions of ozone were accompanied by a prompt release of oxygenated volatile organic compounds, which could be linked to the corresponding precursor compounds: ozonolysis cis -abienol (C 20 H 34 O) – a diterpenoid with two exocyclic double bonds – caused emissions of formaldehyde (HCHO) and methyl vinyl ketone (C 4 H 6 O). The ring-structured cembratrien-diols (C 20 H 34 O 2) with three endocyclic double bonds need at least two ozonolysis steps to form volatile carbonyls such as 4 -oxopentanal (C 5 H 8 O 2), which we could observe in the gas phase, too. Fluid dynamic calculations were used to model ozone distribution in the diffusion-limited leaf boundary layer under daylight conditions. In the case of an ozone-reactive leaf surface, ozone gradients in the vicinity of stomatal pores are changed {{in such a way that}} the ozone flux through the open stomata is strongly reduced. Our results show that unsaturated semi-volatile compounds at the plant surface should be considered as a source of oxygenated volatile organic compounds, impacting gas phase chemistry, as well as efficient <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> improving the ozone tolerance of plants...|$|E

Moreover, LTD is shown to offer an explanation for the fact that some down revision of the O+HO 2 rate constant, or the ratio of the O+HO 2 to O+OH rate constants, is required to improve agreement between the predictions of traditional modeling and observation.

Stomatal conductance showed expected patterns of behaviour with respect to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and vapour pressure defecit (VPD). Non-stomatal conductance for ozone increased monotonically with increasing PPFD, increased with temperature (T) before falling off again at high T, and behaved similarly for VPD.

Ozone loss to these surfaces was strongly activated {{in the presence}} of irradiation. Under simulated atmospheric conditions with respect to irradiance, relative humidity, and O- 3 mixing ratios, the reactive uptake coefficients of the coatings ranged from gamma similar to 10 (- 6) (in the dark) to gamma similar to 10 (- 4) (under near-UVand visible irradiation) and were inversely dependent on the ozone mixing ratio in the 20 - to 270 -ppbv range. For the aerosol experiment the uptakes were an order of magnitude smaller. Light and ozone exposure promoted emissions of volatile organic compounds including small aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, hexanal, octanal, nonanal), methanol, and acetone. These results together suggest the existence of photoinduced ozone removal at the surface of various humic substances, which may be a potentially important <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> in the continental boundary layer and can represent a possible pathway for processing the organic aerosol...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} oak {{were used in}} a series of chamber based experiments. The species of oaks chosen (Quercus alba, muehlenbergii, and virginiana) were {{selected}} because they are all emitters of the volatile organic compound isoprene. Isoprene emissions as well as several physiological parameters such as photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were monitored under normal conditions, as well as while stressors such as drought and high external ozone were introduced. Ozone fluxes to the plants were partitioned into stomatal and surface fluxes for leaves treated with an isoprenoid coating as well as untreated leaves. It was found that the coating on the leaves acted as a strong surface <b>ozone</b> <b>sink,</b> which reduced ozone concentrations in the leaf boundary layer and resulted in significantly reduced stomatal fluxes of ozone. Measurements of drought stressed specimens displayed significant declines in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, however isoprene emissions remained constant. This resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of assimilated carbon emitted as isoprene during times of water stress and represented a decoupling of photosynthesis from isoprene production. The level of circadian control over isoprene emissions was assessed for a Q. muehlenbergii specimen by exposing it to constant light for several days.

40|$|Portable air {{cleaners}} are popular and heavily marketed devices that are sold to improve indoor air quality. One prominent air cleaning technology is ion generation, which can emit up to 5 mg/hr of ozone as {{a byproduct of}} its operation. The ozone emitted by ion generators can react with unsaturated organic compounds to form ultrafine and fine particles, as well as aldehydes and free radicals. This research experimentally characterizes the indoor air quality implications of an ion generator in a 27 m 3 residential room, with a matrix of four different room test configurations. Two of the tests had carpet (a likely <b>ozone</b> <b>sink)</b> in the room, and for one test with and without carpet, a popular plug-in air freshener {{was used as a}} source of terpenes. Each experiment lasted at least four days: two days of background measurements, and two days with an operating ion generator. Measurements included airborne sampling of size-resolved particulate matter (0. 015 – 20 µm), C 1 -C 10 aldehydes and terpenes, ozone concentrations, and air exchange rates. This study finds that the use of ion generators {{in the presence of a}} common air freshener can lead to a net increase in fine and ultrafine particulate matter (< 0. 5 !m) and ozone, as well as formaldehyde and nonanal.

40|$|This study scrutinizes {{a decade-long}} series of ozone {{deposition}} measurements in a boreal forest {{in search for}} the signature and relevance of the different deposition processes. Canopy-level ozone flux measurements were analysed for deposition characteristics and partitioning into stomatal and non-stomatal fractions, focusing on growing season day-time data. Ten years of measurements enabled the analysis of ozone deposition variation at different time- scales, including daily to inter-annual variation {{as well as the}} dependence on environmental variables and concentration of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC-s). Stomatal deposition was estimated by using multi-layer canopy dispersion and optimal stomatal control modelling from simultaneous carbon dioxide and water vapour flux measurements, non-stomatal was inferred as residual. Also, utilising big-leaf assumption stomatal conductance was inferred from water vapour fluxes for dry canopy conditions. The total ozone deposition was highest during the peak growing season (4 mm s&minus; 1 ) and lowest during winter dormancy (1 mm s&minus; 1 ). During the course of the growing season the fraction of the non-stomatal deposition of ozone was determined to vary from 26 to 44 % during day time, increasing {{from the start of the}} season until the end of the growing season. By using multi-variate analysis it was determined that day-time total ozone deposition was mainly driven by photosynthetic capacity of the canopy, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetically active radiation and monoterpene concentration. The multi-variate linear model explained high portion of ozone deposition variance on daily average level (R 2 = 0. 79). The explanatory power of the multi-variate model for ozone non-stomatal deposition was much lower (R 2 = 0. 38). Model calculation was performed to evaluate the potential sink strength of the chemical reactions of ozone with sesquiterpenes in the canopy air space, which revealed that sesquiterpenes in typical amounts at the site were unlikely to cause significant ozone loss in canopy air space. This was also confirmed by the statistical analysis that did not link measured sesquiterpene concentration with ozone deposition. It was concluded that chemical reactions with monoterpenes, or other removal mechanisms such as surface reactions, play a role as <b>ozone</b> non-stomatal <b>sink</b> inside canopy...|$|R

Ozone {{plays an important role in}} the Earth System, e. g. damaging vegetation, modifying the oxidation potential of the atmosphere and by acting as a greenhouse gas. Dry deposition of ozone to terrestrial surfaces governs its potential to cause damage and provides an important atmospheric <b>sink.</b> <b>Ozone</b> is very reactive so readily deposits on most surfaces. It is also taken in through stomata as the plant respires and this stomatal uptake can cause damage to the plant. Stomatal uptake is estimated using existing stomatal conductance models that have been well characterized and evaluated. However non-stomatal deposition has not been well described in land-atmosphere exchange models to date. Several sets of ozone flux measurements have been collated to examine the non-stomatal deposition process. The data showed ozone deposition increased to dry canopies as temperature or solar radiation increased, consistent with the thermal decomposition of ozone on leaf cuticles or reactions with emitted biogenic VOCs. It was also found that the presence of surface water increased ozone deposition, probably due to aqueous chemical reactions with compounds in the water; therefore this may depend on the composition of cuticular waxes or the presence of other deposited compounds. A new parameterisation for non-stomatal ozone deposition to grassland and coniferous forests is derived and incorporated into a standard resistance type deposition model. This new model is evaluated using data reserved from the parameterization process and compared to other existing models...|$|R

Recent {{studies have shown}} that the Antarctic continent plays an important role in the global mercury cycle. Therefore, long term measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) were initiated at the Norwegian Antarctic Research Station, Troll (TRS) in order to improve our understanding of atmospheric transport, transformation and removal processes of GEM. GEM measurements started in February 2007 and are still ongoing, and this paper presents results from the first four years. The mean annual GEM concentration of 0. 93 ± 0. 19 ng m − 3 is in good agreement with other recent southern-hemispheric measurements. Measurements of GEM were combined with the output of the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, for a statistical analysis of GEM source and sink regions. It was found that the ocean is a source of GEM to TRS year round, especially in summer and fall. On time scales of up to 20 days, there is little direct transport of GEM to TRS from Southern Hemisphere continents, but sources there are important for determining the overall GEM load in the Southern Hemisphere and for the mean GEM concentration at TRS. Further, the sea ice and marginal ice zones are GEM sinks in spring as also seen in the Arctic, but the Antarctic oceanic sink seems weaker. Contrary to the Arctic, a strong summer time GEM sink was found, when air originates from the Antarctic plateau, which shows that the summertime removal mechanism of GEM is completely different and is caused by other chemical processes than the springtime atmospheric mercury depletion events. The results were corroborated by an analysis of <b>ozone</b> source and <b>sink</b> regions...|$|R

However, due to its deleterious effects, plant functioning {{is affected by the}} ozone absorbed. It is thus necessary to both predict total ozone deposition to ecosystems and partition the fluxes in stomatal and non-stomatal pathways. The Surfatm-O 3 model was developed to predict ozone deposition to agroecosystems from sowing to harvest, taking into account each deposition pathways during bare soil, growth, maturity, and senescence periods. An additional sink was added during senescence: stomatal deposition for yellow leaves, not able to photosynthesise but transpiring. The model was confronted to measurements performed over three maize crops in different regions of France. Modelled and measured fluxes agreed well for one dataset for any phenological stage, with only 3 % difference over the whole cropping season. A larger discrepancy was found for the two other sites, 16 % and 19 % over the entire study period, especially during bare soil, early growth and senescence. This was attributed to site-specific soil resistance to ozone and possible chemical reactions between ozone and volatile organic compounds emitted during late senescence. Considering both night-time and daytime conditions, non-stomatal deposition was the major <b>ozone</b> <b>sink,</b> from 100 % during bare soil period to 70 – 80 % on average during maturity. However, considering only daytime conditions, especially under optimal climatic conditions for plant functioning, stomatal flux could represent 75 % of total ozone flux.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarAnthropogenic {{activities}} have dramatically altered the chemical {{composition of the}} atmosphere. The focus {{of this study is}} on the composition of the troposphere, mainly associated with ozone which acts as a greenhouse gas, is damaging to living organisms, and co-determines the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. A coupled tropospheric chemistry - general circulation model (ECHAM) has been applied to the simulation of tropospheric ozone distributions, using emissions of ozone precursors (NOx, CO, higher hydrocarbons) as boundary conditions. The model has been extended with detailed parameterizations for dry deposition of trace species, for the lower stratospheric ozone concentration which is used as boundary condition, and for the treatment of higher hydrocarbon species. The model has been extensively evaluated by comparison with observed long-term climatological data and with in-situ measurements from specific measurement campaigns. A proper representation of all <b>ozone</b> sources and <b>sinks</b> is prerequisite to an accurate estimate of the anthropogenic ozone increase in the troposphere. The representativity of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, which forms a major source for ozone in the troposphere, and its contribution to tropospheric ozone levels has been studied. Simulations have been performed using pre-industrial, present-day and future emission scenarios as boundary conditions, and the radiative forcing associated with the ozone increases has been estimated. The annually averaged global tropospheric ozone contents from these simulations are 190 Tg O 3, 271 Tg O 3, and 332 Tg O 3 in 2025, corresponding to a global annual net radiative forcing at the tropopause of 0. 42 W m- 2 between the pre-industrial and the present-day simulations, and of 0. 31 W m- 2 between the present and future simulations.

40|$|Except {{for a few}} {{reactions}} involving electronically excited molecular or atomic oxygen or nitrogen, {{atmospheric chemistry}} modelling usually assumes that the temperature dependence of reaction rates is characterized by Arrhenius law involving kinetic temperatures. It is known, however, that in the upper atmosphere the vibrational temperatures may exceed the kinetic temperatures by several hundreds of Kelvins. This excess energy {{has an impact on}} the reaction rates. We have used upper atmospheric OH populations and reaction rate coefficients for OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O 3 and OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O to estimate the effective (i. e. population weighted) reaction rates for various atmospheric conditions. We have found that the effective rate coefficient for OH(v= 0 [...] . 9) +O 3 can be larger by a factor of up to 1020 than that involving OH in its vibrational ground state only. At altitudes where vibrationally excited states of OH are highly populated, the OH reaction is a minor sink of Ox and O 3 compared to other reactions involving, e. g., atomic oxygen. Thus the impact of vibrationally excited OH on the <b>ozone</b> or Ox <b>sink</b> remains small. Among quiescent atmospheres under investigation, the largest while still small (less than 0. 1 %) effect was found for the polar winter upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The contribution of the reaction of vibrationally excited OH with ozone to the OH sink is largest in the upper polar winter stratosphere (up to 4 %), while its effect on the HO 2 source is larger in the lower thermosphere (up to 1 % for polar winter and 1. 7 % for midlatitude night conditions).

40|$|Understanding {{the fate}} of ozone within and above forested environments is vital to {{assessing}} the anthropogenic impact on ecosystems and air quality at the urban-rural interface. Observed forest-atmosphere exchange of ozone is often much faster than explicable by stomatal uptake alone, suggesting the presence of additional ozone sinks within the canopy. Using the Chemistry of Atmosphere-Forest Exchange (CAFE) model in conjunction with summer noontime observations from the 2007 Biosphere Effects on Aerosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX- 2007), we explore the viability and implications of the hypothesis that ozonolysis of very reactive but yet unidentified biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) can influence the forest-atmosphere exchange of ozone. Non-stomatal processes typically generate 67 % of the observed ozone flux, but reactions of ozone with measured BVOC, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, can account for only 2 % of this flux during the selected timeframe. By incorporating additional emissions and chemistry of a proxy for very reactive VOC (VRVOC) that undergo rapid ozonolysis, we demonstrate that an in-canopy chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> of ~ 2 &times; 10 8 molecules cm&minus; 3 s&minus; 1 can close the ozone flux budget. Even in such a case, the 65 min chemical lifetime of ozone is much longer than the canopy residence time of ~ 2 min, highlighting that chemistry can influence reactive trace gas exchange {{even when it is}} "slow" relative to vertical mixing. This level of VRVOC ozonolysis could enhance OH and RO 2 production by as much as 1 pptv s&minus; 1 and substantially alter their respective vertical profiles depending on the actual product yields. Reaction products would also contribute significantly to the oxidized VOC budget and, by extension, secondary organic aerosol mass. Given the potentially significant ramifications of a chemical ozone flux for both in-canopy chemistry and estimates of ozone deposition, future efforts should focus on quantifying both ozone reactivity and non-stomatal (e. g. cuticular) deposition within the forest...|$|E
40|$|A {{differential}} absorption lidar was constructed at the laboratory at York University and deployed in field campaigns to measure vertical profiles of tropospheric ozone. Profiles of ozone concentration were derived from the range-resolved simultaneous detection of backscatter from two or more wavelengths of laser radiation. By analyzing the absorption differences due to ozone between the two lidar returns, an ozone profile along the optical path of the laser was determined. This method is capable of resolving ozone concentrations between a range of 300 m to 8 km from the lidar. During the spring in the polar region, tropospheric ozone depletion events occur due {{to the presence of}} inert halide salt ions such as Br- in the atmosphere. After polar sunrise, this Bromine photochemistry can cause ozone concentrations near the ice surface to drop to near zero levels. Outstanding questions addressed by the lidar measurements were (a) whether significant ozone depletion occurs in layers not connected to the surface, and, (b) how local topography can influence ozone concentrations measured at land based locations such as Eureka NU. Measurements were made during three field campaigns. The first was on the Amundsen icebreaker ship of the Canadian Coast Guard as part of the circumpolar Flow Lead study. For the second campaign the lidar was installed on the Polar- 5 aircraft for flights over the sea ice north of Barrow Alaska. The third campaign involved ground based measurements from Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic. All of the measured ozone depletions were connected to the surface, and no evidence of ozone depleted air detached from the boundary layer was found. The lack of free tropospheric depletions indicate that such events are likely rare, and not a significant <b>ozone</b> <b>sink.</b> While measuring tropospheric ozone from a land based location, the measured depletions were found to be mainly confined to the atmospheric boundary layer except in instances where surrounding topography enabled the transport of ozone depleted air into the free troposphere.

We studied Scots pine foliage in field {{conditions at the}} SMEARII field measurement station in Finland. We used a combination of data from flux measurement at the shoot (enclosure) and canopy scale (eddy covariance), information from foliage surface wetness sensors, and {{a broad array of}} ancillary measurements such as radiation, precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity. Environmental conditions were defined as moist during rain or high relative humidity and during the subsequent twelve hours from such events, circumstances that were frequent at this boreal site. From the measured fluxes we estimated the ozone conductance using it as the expression of the strength of ozone removal surface sink or total deposition. Further, we estimated the stomatal contribution and the remaining deposition was interpreted and analysed as the non-stomatal sink. The combined time series of measurements showed that both shoot and canopy-scale ozone total deposition were enhanced when moist conditions occurred. On average, the estimated stomatal deposition accounted for half of the measured removal at the shoot scale and one third at the canopy scale. However, during dry conditions the estimated stomatal uptake predicted the behaviour of the measured deposition, but during moist conditions there was disagreement. The estimated non-stomatal sink was analysed against several environmental factors and the clearest connection was found with ambient relative humidity. The relationship disappeared under 70 % relative humidity, a threshold that coincides with the value at which surface moisture gathers at the foliage surface according to the leaf surface wetness measurements. This suggests the non-stomatal <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> on the foliage to be modulated by the surface films. We attempted to extract such potential modulation with the estimated film formation via the theoretical expression of adsorption. Whereas this procedure could predict the behaviour of the non-stomatal sink, it implied a chemical sink that was not accountable as simple ozone decomposition. We discuss the existence of other mechanisms whose relevance in the removal of ozone needs to be clarified, in particular: a significant nocturnal stomatal aperture neglected in the estimations, and a potentially large chemical sink offered by reactive biogenic organic volatile compounds...|$|E

Results from the CODE aircraft data document composition and size of the dominant structures, which transport heat and gases (H 2 O, CO 2 and ozone) over water stressed and non-water stressed surfaces, and the relative frequency with which structures carrying only a single scalar, or given combinations of scalars, were encountered along the flight paths. Interpretation of results provides further evidence for the existence of a second (nonphysiological) sink for ozone. The relative preponderance of structures that carry moisture, carbon dioxide and ozone simultaneously, particularly in the gradient-up mode, reflects the importance of vegetation as co-located source/sink for these scalars. The detrending procedures described in this study may help to define a more effective separation between local and mesoscale events in biosphere-atmosphere interaction. Results from the CODE tower data indicates a single vegetated <b>ozone</b> <b>sink</b> for the grape site, but a vegetated as well as a non-vegetated sink for the cotton site. For both sites, structures simultaneously transporting significant flux contributions of CO 2, H 2 O, heat and ozone dominate during unstable conditions. During stable conditions, unmixed single flux structures dominated over cotton but not over grape. The results of this study contribute empirical evidence about the relationship between ozone uptake and the physical and physiological state of vegetation, as well as the limitations placed on eddy scales in simulation models. Results from the BOREAS aircraft data shows a decoupling between the surface and the atmosphere, where the patterns of vegetation, greenness and surface temperature may be quite dissimilar to those of the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and [...] -to a lesser degree [...] -CO 2. Reasons for this lie in the extraordinary boundary layer conditions, high vapour pressure deficit, moist soil and hot canopies, and the response of the vegetation to these conditions. Analysis of the coherent structure compositions to some extent permits the characterization of the different sources and sinks. Overall, this study shows the importance of understanding the various interacting components of soil, vegetation and atmosphere when attempting to design process-based models for predictions in 'micrometeorologiacally' complex ecosystems...|$|E
