25|$|President Abdulla Yameen congratulated Trump on his victory. In his message, he said “I remain {{confident}} that the existing ties of friendship and cooperation between our two countries will continue and further strengthen under your able leadership. I also {{look forward to working}} with you not only to develop closer relations between <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> but also to concert on advancement of global interests common to our countries”. The President also said that he support Trump’s policy of “no-interference” on other countries affairs. He added “Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America’s efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world. This, without a doubt, is a very good principle”.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the interwar period, Arab nationalists bore Germany no ill-will, {{despite its}} earlier {{support for the}} Ottoman Empire. Like many Arab countries, it was {{perceived}} {{as a victim of}} the post-World War I settlement. Hitler himself often spoke of the 'infamy of Versailles'. Unlike France and Great Britain it had not exercised imperial designs on the Middle East, and its past policy of non-intervention was interpreted as a token of good will. While the scholarly consensus is that Husseini's motives for supporting the Axis powers and his alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were deeply inflected by anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideology from the outset, some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, deny that the relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons, on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs, 'the enemy of your enemy is your friend'.Translation: 'I have considered Germany to be a friendly country, because it was not a colonizing country, and it never harmed any Arab or Islamic country, and because it was fighting our colonialist and Zionist enemies, and because the enemy of your enemy is your friend. And I was certain that Germany's victory would definitely save <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> from the danger of Zionism and colonization'.Mudhakkirat al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni, Damascus 1999 p.96. When Husseini eventually met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that 'The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because they had the same enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists'.|$|E

[...] The groundwork for Vigilant Eagle was laid in a June 2003 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia between President of the United States George W.

Coming less than two years after the September 11 attacks, and in the aftermath of an increase in Russian-American tensions resulting from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the meeting saw progress in developing informal comity for bilateral cooperation in areas of anti-terrorism.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as {{directly}} rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being [...] "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies." [...] Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, [...] "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [...] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." [...] He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand [...] "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," [...] to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had [...] "slipped" [...] from its positions. [...] "According to you," [...] Khrushchev continued, [...] "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." [...] The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, [...] "You are like Stalin who killed people," [...] to which Hoxha replied, [...] "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> [...] there are no established churches, but in <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> {{there are people who have}} faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E

Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: [...] "This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [...] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in <b>our</b> <b>countries</b> and killing us and killing our innocents.

[...] The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, {{on the day of the}} shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.|$|E

And, contrary to what you might hear, surveys show that the Russian people are as pro-American, if not more so, than the populations of many a European country, and most hope for closer relations with the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "I would argue that the American business community has played a not insignificant role in fostering these developments. By their willingness to invest in Russia's future, American companies have become effective ambassadors for the United States and its values, while creating new jobs and benefiting the economies of both <b>our</b> <b>countries.</b> And the Putin government has been supportive of these efforts in ways that some might find surprising.
