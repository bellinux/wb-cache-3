40|$|SUMMARY Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{epidemiological}} profile, risk {{factors in the}} workplace environment and prevention methods for professionals at risk of skin cancer. Method: A systematic review of articles on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> published in the Lilacs, Scielo, Medline and Cochrane Library from January 1 st, 2008, to December 31 st, 2013, was performed. The search included the following terms: &# 8220;neoplasias cutâneas&# 8221; (DeCS), &# 8220;exposição ocupacional&# 8221; (DeCS), &# 8220;epidemiologia&# 8221; (DeCS) {{as well as the}} keyword &# 8220;prevenção&# 8221;, and their equivalents in English. Results: After analyzing the titles and summaries of articles, the search strategy resulted in 83 references, of which 22 articles met the eligibility criteria. Discussion: We found that sun exposure is the main occupational risk factor for skin cancer, causing outdoor workers to be the most vulnerable to developing <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Professionals with low levels of education and European descent are at increased risk of developing this cancer. Conclusion: Outdoor workers are more vulnerable to developing <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> estimating that professionals with low level of education and European descent are at increased risk of developing this cancer. Therefore, companies need to invest more in the health of workers by providing protective equipment and thus preventing <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Sun {{sensitivity}} of the skin is {{a risk factor for}} the development of cutaneous melanoma and other skin cancers. Epidemiological studies on causal factors for the development of melanoma must control for sun sensitivity as a confounder. A standardized instrument for measuring sun sensitivity has not been established yet. It is assumed that many studies show a high potential of residual confounding for sun sensitivity. In the present study, a new questionnaire for the assessment of self-reported sun sensitivity is administered and examined. Methods Prior to an <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening program, the 745 participating employees were asked to fill in a questionnaire for self-assessment of sun sensitivity. The questionnaire was developed by experts of the working group "Round Table Sunbeds" (RTS) to limit the health hazards of sunbed use in Germany. A sun sensitivity score (RTS-score) was calculated using 10 indicators. The internal consistency of the questionnaire and the agreement with other methods (convergent validity) were examined. Results The RTS-score was calculated for 655 study participants who were 18 to 65 years of age. The correlation of the items among each other was between 0. 12 and 0. 62. The items and the RTS-score correlated between 0. 46 and 0. 77. The internal consistency showed a reliability coefficient with 0. 82 (Cronbach's alpha). The comparison with the Fitzpatrick classification, the prevailing standard, was possible in 617 cases with a rank correlation of r s = 0. 65. The categorization of the RTS-score in four risk groups showed correct classification to the four skin types of Fitzpatrick in 75 % of the cases. Other methods for the assessment of sun sensitivity displayed varying agreements with the RTS-score. Conclusion The RTS questionnaire showed a sufficient internal consistency. There is a good convergent validity between the RTS-score and the Fritzpatrick classification avoiding shortcomings of the prevailing standard. The questionnaire represents a simple, reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of sun sensitivity. The questionnaire can be useful for epidemiological studies as well as for skin cancer prevention. Further development and standardization of sun sensitivity assessments is necessary to strengthen the evidence of epidemiological studies on causal factors of melanoma and other skin cancers. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} in Caucasian populations worldwide and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known for being the number one carcinogen. As, especially in outdoor workers, UVR is an inevitable carcinogen, the prevention and management of UVR-related <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in these at-risk populations represent a collective challenge for dermatologists and healthcare policymakers likewise. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current regulations on the acknowledgement and management of work-related <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in 11 European countries. METHODS: Dermatologists from 11 countries networking within the EU Horizon 2020 COST Action TD 1206 'StanDerm' contributed to a standardized survey regarding current national regulations, implemented for the recognition, prevention and management as well as possible compensation regulations in their individual country of residence. RESULTS: Ten of 11 participating countries in this survey reported the existence of an established programme available on certain <b>occupational</b> diseases; work-related <b>skin</b> diseases were only specifically recognized in eight countries. Seven of 11 countries recognize cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in outdoor workers as 'occupational skin cancer'. Basal cell carcinoma (6 of 11), actinic keratosis (5 of 11), Bowen's disease (5 of 11) and malignant melanoma (5 of 11) are not as regularly approved as potentially 'work-induced'. Only a few of the countries included into this survey established a general documentation system (national registry) on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> diseases. So far, representatives of only three countries of this survey referred to a specific established national programme for the prevention, management or compensation of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> acquired during work-related UVR exposure. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the need for mandatory regulations on the prevention, management and potential compensation of work-related UV-induced <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> across Europe. Against the background of a joint European domestic market, equal standards of occupational safety across Europe should include binding regulations for the protection and management of work-related <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> The design of a common regulation to meet the increasing incidence of <b>skin</b> <b>cancers</b> in outdoor workers should become part of the European agenda, ensuring equal working and living conditions in the member states...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is an {{increasing}} worldwide public health concern. Rates of melanoma and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> continue to rise worldwide, creating a significant public health need for detection. In 2003, nearly 54, 000 Americans were diagnosed with melanoma with an expected 7, 700 deaths. The visual skin exam is an effective secondary prevention tool in detecting melanoma and nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and may be implemented in occupational medical clinics. Methods: Applying {{the results of a}} comprehensive literature review of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening efforts in communities and workplaces to <b>occupational</b> medicine. Results: <b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening efforts have identified high-risk populations for melanoma and nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and may detect suspicious lesions early. Conclusions: Occupational physicians may be the only healthcare provider with the opportunity to screen a high-risk population, particularly males over age 50. Integrating a skin examination into pre-employment or periodic examinations would expend minimal time and funds while potentially preventing worker morbidity and mortality. Screening for <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> at the workplace may also fulfill a public health need. The integration of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening into <b>occupational</b> medicine may simultaneously improve worker health and increase the value of the occupational medicine physician...|$|R
50|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>skin</b> {{diseases}} and conditions are generally caused by chemicals and having wet hands {{for long periods}} while at work. Eczema {{is by far the}} most common, but urticaria, sunburn and <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> are also of concern.|$|R
40|$|Non-melanoma {{skin cancer}} (NMSC) {{is by far}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} in westernized countries, and one of the few almost preventable cancers if detected and treated early as up to 90 % of NMSC may be attributed to excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The incidence of NMSC is increasing: 2 - 3 million people are diagnosed worldwide annually, with an average yearly increase of 3 - 8 % among white populations in Australia, Europe, the US and Canada over the last 30 years. The link between solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and certain forms of NMSC is clearly recognized. It is estimated that outdoor workers are exposed to an UV radiation dose 2 - 3 times higher than indoor workers, and there is a growing body of research linking UV radiation exposure in outdoor workers to NMSC: Occupationally UV-exposed workers are at least at a 43 % higher risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and almost doubled risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to the average population, with risk increasing with decreasing latitude. The risk for BCC, SCC and actinic keratosis (AK) among workers who have worked outdoors for more than 5 years is 3 -fold higher than the risk among those with no years of working outdoors. Primary prevention, early detection, treatment and regular follow-up of skin cancer (NMSC and melanoma) are shown to be beneficial from a health economic perspective. Action is needed at international, European and national level to legislate for recognizing AK and NMSC as an occupational disease, which has the potential to improve access to compensation and drive preventative activities. This report is a Call to Action for: The engagement of key stakeholders, including supranational institutions, national governments, trade organizations, employers, workers and patient organizations to drive change in prevention and protection of at-risk groups. Employers should be obliged to prevent outdoor worker's UV exposure from exceeding limit values, and to implement <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> screening programmes among the at-risk workforce. Educational programmes for the outdoor workforce are needed to improve health literacy and drive behavioural change. Nationally, steps to improve notifications and surveillance of skin cancers through both occupational services and public health programmes are required. Future research activities should focus on the precise definition of at-risk groups among outdoor workers through increased data gathering, including UV-dosimetry, and evaluation.

40|$|Background: Construction workers spend a large {{proportion}} of their work time outdoors, placing them at increased risk for skin cancer. To date, no large-scale studies have examined occupational sun safety knowledge, attitudes, and practices within this group in the UK context. Given the high incidence of skin cancer attributable to sun exposure in construction relative to other occupational groups, interventions to promote sun safety in the UK construction sector are warranted. Aims: The current investigation has two aims. First, to describe the occupational sun safety knowledge, attitudes, and practices of a large and nationally representative sample of construction workers in the UK. Second, to evaluate change in sun safety knowledge and practices among construction workers in response to an educational intervention. Methods: The first aim was addressed through the administration of a self-report questionnaire in the summer of 2012. The second aim was addressed through the subsequent administration of a bespoke sector-specific DVD-based intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated via the administration of a further questionnaire at 12 -month follow-up. Results: A total of 1, 279 workers from 22 organizations completed a baseline (pre-intervention) self-report questionnaire. Findings indicated poor knowledge on the topic and of the measures available to reduce levels of solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. The findings {{at this stage of the}} project confirmed the imperative for a tailored, targeted, and evaluable educational intervention that could help to enhance sun safety knowledge, attitudes and behavior in the sector. In relation to the second aim, analyses were conducted on a sample of 120 workers (intervention group, n = 70; comparison group, n = 50). At follow-up the proportion of intervention group participants that reported correct sun safety knowledge was not significantly greater than at baseline. However, the intervention group demonstrated significant positive change on nine out of ten behavioural measures, the greatest change being use of a shade/cover when working in the sun followed by regularly checking skin for moles or unusual changes. Conclusions: The profiling exercise indicated that there is a need to raise the profile of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> among this population and increase the priority given to occupational sun safety policies alongside targeted, tailored, and evaluable interventions. Exposure to this intervention was linked to some specific positive changes in construction workers’ self-reported sun safety practices. These findings highlight the potential for educational interventions to contribute to tackling skin cancer in the UK construction sector. The findings support the development of bespoke educational interventions for other high-risk outdoor worker groups...|$|E

Population-based studies estimating the impact of atopic <b>skin</b> diathesis on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> disease in various occupations have not been reported to date. We analyzed data of all initial reports of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> diseases recorded in the register of <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> diseases in northern Bavaria, Germany, from 1990 to 1999. The main outcome measure was the attributable risk of atopic <b>skin</b> diathesis on <b>occupational</b> <b>skin</b> disease within 24 occupational groups that are most hazardous to the skin. Of the 5285 registered cases, 3730 had a confirmed occupational causation. Among these, 1366 workers (37 %) presented an atopic skin diathesis.

40|$|Background: Nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} post-transplant malignancy found in renal transplant recipients. Long term immunosuppressant therapy, previous history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and UV exposure are the greatest drivers of these malignancies in renal transplant recipients compared to the general population. Squamous cell carcinoma {{is the most}} prevalent type of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> lesions {{that can lead to}} increased morbidity and metastasis in this population. Sirolimus is a relatively new immunosuppressant that is known to have anti-tumor effects, especially in the instance of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> Will sirolimus reduce the recurrence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in renal transplant recipients with a previous history of nomelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer?</b> Method: An extensive medical literature search was completed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, EBSCO, and Web of Knowledge. Search terms used included <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> <b>skin</b> neoplasm, organ transplant, renal transplant, and sirolimus. Relevant articles were further evaluated for quality using the GRADE criteria. Results: Three randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. The studies showed a decreased incidence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in renal transplant recipients with a history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> One study demonstrated a significantly longer survival free of squamous cell carcinoma in the sirolimus group compared to calcineurin inhibitor therapy. Another study found a significantly decreased rate of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> in the sirolimus group. All studies observed an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions in the sirolimus group that led to high discontinuation rates. The overall quality of evidence was low after assessing each study with GRADE criteria. Conclusion: The findings suggest that sirolimus is effective at reducing the recurrence of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> lesions in renal transplant recipients with a history of nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> While there appears to be some significance for sirolimus conversion of renal transplant recipients with nonmelanoma <b>skin</b> <b>cancer,</b> better quality research is necessary to determine the long term effects of sirolimus in renal transplant patients. Further studies are needed to determine when sirolimus should be initiated in patients to prevent <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> and treatment duration...|$|R

40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} cancer in the light-skinned population and it is generally caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Early detection of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> {{has the potential to}} reduce mortality and morbidity. There are many diagnostic technologies and tests to diagnose <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> However many of these tests are extremely complex and subjective and depend heavily on the experience of the clinician. To obviate these problems, image processing techniques, a neural network system (NN) and a fuzzy inference system were used in this study as promising modalities for detection of different types of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer.</b> The accuracy rate of the diagnosis of <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> by using the hierarchal neural network was 90. 67 % while using neuro-fuzzy system yielded a slightly higher rate of accuracy of 91. 26 % in diagnosis <b>skin</b> <b>cancer</b> type.
