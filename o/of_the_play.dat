5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur off-air reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched {{a search for a}} video recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, but it seems that a full off-air audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian Woodward, and the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play. In November 2008, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, narrated by Bob Harris, about Dylan's visit to London and the making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{captain and}} the {{leadership}} group represents <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> group. If a player does something to <b>the</b> detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> group (such as inappropriate behaviour like taking drugs), then the captain will often act in <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> group and request that the club or league take appropriate action.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>playing</b> {{field is}} a concept often used to {{describe}} level of fairness in electoral competition. With Levitsky and Way’s definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field as a case in point, this paper takes a critical look at existing work on <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field, arguing that current conceptualizations suffer from lacking conceptual logic, operationalization and measurement. A new and disaggregated framework that can {{serve as the basis}} for future research on <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field is then proposed. This framework is applied to an illustrative case study on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field in Zambia under MMD rule, thereby demonstrating that it is able to capture both <b>the</b> changing nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field and <b>the</b> differing mechanisms at play to a larger degree than the framework put forth by Levitsky and Way. The 2011 elections in Zambia also clearly highlight <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> conceptually and empirically separating <b>the</b> slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field from its impact on both the opposition and electoral outcomes...|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} many radio {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> followed in 1927 and 1936. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the four-act version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> with Fabia Drake as Lady Bracknell, Richard Pasco as Jack, Jeremy Clyde as Algy, Maurice Denham as Canon Chasuble, Sylvia Coleridge as Miss Prism, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Gwendolen and Prunella Scales as Cecily. The production was later released on CD.|$|E
5|$|A musical play, London Road, {{commissioned}} by the Royal National Theatre and written by Alecky Blythe and Adam Cork, is {{based on interviews with}} residents of the street in Ipswich where Steve Wright lived. A film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was released in the United Kingdom in 2015. The case was featured in an episode of the documentary series Real Crime.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E

50|$|Old Comedy's {{emphasis}} on real personalities and local issues makes <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> difficult to appreciate today without <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> scholarly commentaries — see for example articles on The Knights, The Wasps and Peace for lists <b>of</b> topical references. <b>The</b> topicality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> had unique consequences {{for both the}} writing and <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> in ancient Athens.|$|R

5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{high school}} student at Chengzhong, Chen was {{influenced}} by the post-May Fourth surge of modern drama. In 1928, he entered Daxia University (a predecessor of East China Normal University) in Shanghai, where he translated, directed, and acted in The Rising of the Moon, a play by the Irish dramatist Lady Gregory. It was the first Chinese production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is known to exist.|$|E

5|$|BBC {{television}} transmissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> {{have included}} a 1974 Play of the Month version starring Coral Browne as Lady Bracknell with Michael Jayston, Julian Holloway, Gemma Jones and Celia Bannerman.

5|$|Ballet {{sequences}} {{have been}} used in many performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> since Restoration times.

5|$|Barrymore and Hopkins {{decided to}} end the run at 101 performances, just {{breaking}} the record of one hundred by Edwin Booth, before the play closed in February 1923. In November and December that year, a three-week run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was staged at the Manhattan Opera House, followed by a brief tour that closed {{at the end of}} January 1924.|$|E
50|$|There are 22 plays, {{including}} huaju and comedies. <b>The</b> {{time span}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> ranges from 1919 to 2000. About half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> were published before the 1980s, including five <b>plays</b> from <b>the</b> Maoist era and seven from <b>the</b> 1920s. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maoist <b>plays</b> is a Cultural Revolution-era model opera drama. In terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political era, 11 {{are from the}} Republican Era and the remainder are from after <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic <b>of</b> China in 1949. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> remainder, eight are from Mainland China, two are from British Hong Kong prior to the 1997 handover, and one is from Taiwan.

5|$|Charles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a {{streamlined}} version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> {{which requires}} only eleven actors. The production {{strongly suggests that}} Lady Macbeth is in league with the witches. One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugène Ionesco's satirical version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> Macbett (1972), one of the witches removes a costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing {{that she was not}} Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.|$|E
5|$|Chen was {{abandoned}} as an infant, and then lost his both foster parents during early childhood. Before becoming a film director, Chen worked mainly in drama. His patriotic play Put Down Your Whip was highly influential and performed countless {{times during the}} Japanese invasion of China.
