40|$|Curves of genus {{greater than}} two exhibit {{arithmetic}} and geometric properties {{very different from}} curves of genus zero and one. In these notes we will survey a few ways of extrapolating these differences to higher dimensional complex manifolds. We will specifically concentrate on Brody and Kobayashi hyperbolicity, which are generalizations of complex analytic properties of higher genus curves. The basic metric and geometric properties that distinguish curves of genus two or more from curves of genus zero and one can be listed as follows. 1. The dimension of the pluricanonical series, h 0 (C, mK), grows linearly with m for curves <b>of</b> genus <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two.</b> 2. The canonical/cotangent bundle of a curve <b>of</b> genus <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> is ample. 3. A curve <b>of</b> genus <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> admits a hyperbolic metric with constant negative curvature. 4. Curves <b>of</b> genus <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> are uniformized by the unit disc, hence they do not admit any non-constant holomorphic maps from C. Each of these properties can be generalized to higher dimensional manifolds...|$|R

5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared.

5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> different categories, vowels and consonants, {{that can}} be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside {{of the level of}} single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E

The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing would have meant a delay <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.|$|E
5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food {{and may have been}} precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's Noddy, about {{a little}} wooden boy from Toyland, first {{appeared}} in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949, and in November that year Noddy Goes to Toyland, the first <b>of</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>two</b> dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including Noddy's Library, Noddy's Garage of Books, Noddy's Castle of Books, Noddy's Toy Station of Books and Noddy's Shop of Books.|$|E
