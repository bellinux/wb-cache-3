40|$|Blood borne {{infectious}} agents such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{and human}} immune deficiency virus (HIV) constitute a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers (HCWs). To some degree {{it is inevitable}} that HCWs sustain injuries from sharp objects such as needles, scalpels and splintered bone during execution of their duties. However, in Tanzania, {{there is little or no}} information on factors that influence the practice of managing <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV by HCWs. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of self-reported <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV among HCWs and explore factors that influence the practice of managing <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV by HCWs in Tanzania. Self-administered questionnaire was designed to gather information of healthcare workers' <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> in the past 12 months and circumstances in which these injuries occurred. Practice of managing <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed by the following questions: Nearly half of the HCWs had experienced at least one occupational injury in the past 12 months. Though most of the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to HIV were experienced by female nurses, non-medical hospital staff received PEP more frequently than nurses and doctors. Doctors and nurses frequently encountered occupational injuries in surgery room and labor room respectively. HCWs with knowledge on the possibility of HIV transmission and those who knew whom to contact in event of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV were less likely to have poor practice of managing <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> Needle stick injuries and splashes are common among HCWs at Tumbi and Dodoma hospitals. Knowledge of the risk of HIV transmission due to <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> and knowing whom to contact in event of exposure predicted practice of managing the exposure.

50|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding, {{also known}} as hazard banding, is a process {{intended}} to quickly and accurately assign chemicals into specific categories (bands), each corresponding {{to a range of}} exposure concentrations designed to protect worker health.

The output of this process is an <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> band (OEB). <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding has been used by the pharmaceutical sector and by some major chemical companies {{over the past several decades}} to establish exposure control limits or ranges for new or existing chemicals that do not have formal OELs.

50|$|The NIOSH <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding {{process is}} being created {{to provide a}} {{reliable}} approximation of a safe exposure level for potentially hazardous and unregulated chemicals in the workplace. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding uses limited chemical toxicity data to group chemicals into one of five bands.

Furthermore, going through the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding process may identify potential health effects and target organs, identify health risks that {{should be included in}} health communications, inform decisions regarding control interventions, inform medical surveillance decisions, and provide critical information on chemical potency quickly.

A cross sectional survey was conducted at Tumbi designated regional hospital and Dodoma regional hospital, Tanzania in February 2012. A self-administered questionnaire was used to capture information on knowledge of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV infection. A total of 401 healthcare workers responded to a self-administered questionnaire. High proportion of healthcare workers (96. 3 %) understood that they are at risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV. The majority of healthcare workers trained on post exposure prophylaxis procedure and use of personal protective equipment were clinicians (87. 1 % and 71. 4 % respectively) and nurses (81. 8 % and 74. 6 % respectively). Over a quarter of the healthcare workers were not aware of whom to contact in the event of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> One third of healthcare workers did not have comprehensive knowledge on causes of occupational HIV transmission and did not know when post exposure prophylaxis is indicated.

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> of {{healthcare}} workers tend to occur because of inconsistent compliance with standard precautions. Also, incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> is underreported among operating room personnel. The {{purpose of this}} project was to develop national estimates for compliance with standard precautions and <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> reporting practices among operating room nurses in Australia. Data was obtained utilizing a 96 -item self-report survey. The Standard Precautions and <b>Occupational</b> <b>Exposure</b> Reporting survey was distributed anonymously to 500 members of the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses. The Health Belief Model was the theoretical framework used to guide the analysis of data. Data was analysed to examine relationships between specific constructs of the Health Belief Model to identify factors that might influence the operating room nurse to undertake particular health behaviours to comply with standard precautions and <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> reporting. Results of the study revealed compliance rates of 55. 6 % with double gloving, 59. 1 % with announcing sharps transfers, 71. 9 % with using a hands-free sharps pass technique, 81. 9 % with no needle recapping and 92. 0 % with adequate eye protection.
