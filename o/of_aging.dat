5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years <b>of</b> <b>aging.</b> There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years.

Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory <b>of</b> <b>aging.</b> A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>aging.</b>|$|E

5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause <b>of</b> <b>aging.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease <b>of</b> <b>aging.</b> The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the cannon spans several hundred years. The cannon was invented in China {{as early as the}} 12th century and traces its {{development}} from the fire lance, the ancestor of cannons and firearms. They were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, and over time replaced siege engines—among other forms <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> weaponry—on the battlefield. Their use was first documented in the Middle East in the 13th century, and the first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the wars amongst Christians and Muslim kingdoms in Spain, in the 13th century. English cannon were first used during the Hundred Years' War, at the Battle of Crécy, in 1346. It was during this period, the Middle Ages, that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles. After the Middle Ages, most large cannon were abandoned, in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defenses obsolete; this led to the construction of star forts, specifically designed to withstand bombardment from artillery.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{longitudinal}} effects of sleep duration and quality on lipid profiles {{during the transition}} from childhood to early adolescence, over a 4 -year-period.

Sleep duration, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and weekend catch-up sleep were measured with actigraphs for 7 (8 years <b>of</b> <b>age)</b> and 8 (12 years <b>of</b> <b>age)</b> nights. Fasting serum samples were collected at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Covariates included age, pubertal development, socioeconomic status, body mass index, and physical activity. RESULTS: In girls, shorter sleep duration at 8 and 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and higher triglycerides at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Poorer sleep quality at 8 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and longer weekend catch-up sleep at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> was associated with higher triglycerides at 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> From 8 to 12 years <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> improvement in sleep quality associated with higher total cholesterol, {{and a decrease in}} sleep duration with lower lipid levels.
