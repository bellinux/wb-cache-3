5|$|In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an {{interest}} in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} to the West Virginia Senate in 1874 and served {{alongside}} R.B. Sherrard and David Pugh, representing the Eleventh Senatorial District. He unsuccessfully ran for election in the Twelfth Senatorial District for a judicial seat in 1883. In 1890, he served as {{the vice president of the}} West Virginia Bar Association from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. By 1907, he was president of the Mineral County Bar Association, and in 1909 he served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> association's Committee on Legal Education. In 1892 Clayton was under consideration as a Democratic candidate for a long term on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, but was not elected as the party's candidate at the state convention.|$|E
5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> at Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L. After the latter sunk, 10people drowned, including the captain. No specific locations {{are known for}} these shipwrecks so no complete track for this storm is known, but it {{was active in the}} western Gulf of Mexico beginning on September18. The storm made landfall early on September19 in a rural area of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico. Based on John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria's inland decay model created in 1995, it is estimated that the cyclone dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with many}} other bits, a pelham may have a solid or a jointed mouthpiece. If solid, it may range from a nearly {{straight}} [...] "Mullen" [...] mouthpiece up to a medium port. The pelham's mouthpiece controls <b>the</b> pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tongue, roof of <b>the</b> mouth, and <b>bars.</b> A mullen mouth places even pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> and tongue. A port places more pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> and provide room for the tongue. A high port may act <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the mouth as it touches, and will act as a fulcrum, amplifying <b>the</b> pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of <b>the</b> mouth.|$|R
50|$|The curb bit's {{mouthpiece}} controls <b>the</b> pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tongue, roof of <b>the</b> mouth, and <b>bars.</b> A mullen mouth places even pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> and tongue. A port places {{more pressure}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> but provides {{room for the}} tongue. A high port may act <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the mouth as it touches. Some western style curbs, particularly the Spade Bit, have both a straight bar mouthpiece and a high welded port., thus acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> tongue and palate. In the wrong hands, such bits can be extremely severe, but on an exquisitely trained animal, they allow the rider {{to communicate with the}} horse with a simple touch of the fingertips to the reins.|$|R

5|$|The attack {{occurred}} at 21:15 on a Wednesday evening, {{as a football}} game featuring Spain and Iceland was being shown. The four participants exited their car carrying shotguns and machine guns and opened fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> The bullets shattered the skull {{of three of the}} victims and hit the fourth in the heart. Three of the targets were killed instantly, with the fourth dying shortly afterwards in hospital. A fifth person was injured after being hit in the foot, but survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 Egyptian {{armor and}} {{anti-tank}} units {{on the west}} bank began moving to the crossing sites. Fifteen minutes later engineers completed the assembly of all 35 ferries and waited for the breaches to be opened. By 18:30 the bridgeheads were nearly five kilometers (3mi) deep. With Israeli artillery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Lev Line eliminated, the immobile SA-2 and SA-3 units were moved forward. From 22:30 to 01:30 after midnight, all bridges—eight heavy and four light—were laid, and along with the ferries, began transporting reinforcements to the opposite bank. In the far south of the canal, at 19th Division's sector, the sand turned into mud making it difficult to clear. Consequently, four ferries and three bridges assigned to that division were deployed seven hours behind schedule. Periodically the bridges were relocated to confuse Israeli air strikes targeting them—the Egyptians had opened 60 passages but were operating only 12 bridges, allowing each bridge to be moved to one of five passages. Throughout the night and up to the following morning, tanks and vehicles kept crossing the canal. Military police were responsible for directing this enormous traffic, utilizing color-coded signs.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine {{told her}} that Ian took {{advantage}} of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day, claiming that Archie was threatening him. He wanted to delete the recording and denies murdering Archie, but Marsden charges him. Days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he will still be charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions {{in the hope of}} a new lead. Peggy returns to Archie's grave; when Marsden asks why, she explains that she didn't believe him when he said his cancer had returned.|$|E
5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase. Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.|$|E

In 1977, Soviet gymnast Elena Mukhina modified the flip by adding a full twist. The movement was later modified in the 1980s when it was performed towards the low bar; that is, the gymnast's flip takes place above <b>the</b> low <b>bar.</b> <b>The</b> Code of Points was later modified to make it illegal to stand <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
