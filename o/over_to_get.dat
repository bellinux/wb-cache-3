According to Robbins, the children viewed the script's sophisticated dialogue as [...] "edgy," [...] finding several words and phrases, among them [...] "eastern syndicate", difficult to pronounce. He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed in one day. Jefferson Airplane was recording next door and came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the children's autographs. Following the special's broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue.|$|E

6000|$|To {{pass into}} the hands of Michael was too much for Morris. He struck his colours. A cheque at two months was nothing, after all.

60|$|Bradley {{felt the}} {{difference}} in the atmosphere, and he walked to his seat with a self-possession that astonished himself. And from that time he was master of the situation. The girls pelted him with chalk and marked figures on his back, but he kept at his work. He had a firm grip on the plow-handles now, and he didn't look back. They grew to respect him, at length, and some of the girls distinctly showed their admiration. Brown came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help on a sum and so did Nettie, and when he sat down beside her she winked in triumph at the other girls while Bradley patiently tried to explain the problem in algebra which was his own terror.|$|E
6000|$|But I {{must go on}} with my story. I went {{straight}} to General Grant's headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might build for a temporary residence.

A group of officers stood chatting outside of it, {{and they told me}} that the General had walked <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his mail.

60|$|He said he must drink something, however, {{and climbed}} upon the seat, and leant <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the bottle. It was {{right at the}} bottom of the hamper, and seemed {{difficult}} to find, and he had to lean over further and further, and, in trying to steer at the same time, from a topsy-turvy point of view, he pulled the wrong line, and sent the boat into the bank, and the shock upset him, and he dived down right into the hamper, and stood there on his head, holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death, his legs sticking up into the air. He dared not move for fear of going over, and had to stay there till I could get hold of his legs, and haul him back, and that made him madder than ever.|$|E
