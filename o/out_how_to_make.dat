5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E

25|$|A typical episode {{generally}} {{follows a}} simple formula: Beaver or Wally (or both) {{get into a}} scrape and then face their parents for a lecture regarding the event. Lectures sometimes {{take the form of}} fables, with Ward allowing the boys to discover their moral meanings and applying those meanings to their lives. Occasionally, when offenses are serious, punishments such as being grounded are dealt the miscreants. The parents are sometimes shown debating the best approach to the situation. Other episodes (especially in earlier seasons) even reverse the formula, with Ward making a parenting mistake and having to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for it.|$|E
25|$|Producer Ray Stark {{bought the}} film rights to do The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in the mid-1980s, {{and it was}} optioned by Universal Pictures. The first choice to direct it was Frank Oz, with Martin Short {{attached}} for the title role, but Oz could not work <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the story work. The film was optioned in 1991 by Steven Spielberg, with Tom Cruise attached for the lead role, but Spielberg left the project to direct Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. Other directors attached were Patrick Read Johnson and Agnieszka Holland. Stark eventually sold the rights to producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who took the film to Paramount Pictures, with Universal Pictures still on as a co-production partner. By summer 1994, Maryland Film Office chief Jack Gerbes was approached {{with the possibility of}} making the film in Baltimore. In October 1998, screenwriter Robin Swicord wrote for director Ron Howard an adapted screenplay of the short story, a project which would potentially star actor John Travolta. In May 2000, Paramount Pictures hired screenwriter Jim Taylor to adapt a screenplay from the short story. The studio also attached director Spike Jonze to helm the project. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman had also written a draft of the adapted screenplay at one point. In June 2003, director Gary Ross entered final negotiations to helm the project based on a new draft penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. In May 2004, director David Fincher entered negotiations to replace Ross in directing the film.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Burke and Tim Alexander {{were the}} visual effects {{supervisors}} for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, [...] "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of {{not making this}} into a zombie movie, so we were constantly trying <b>to</b> figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these dead people coming up look like zombies.

Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to [...] "soften the impact". Although the episode's filming went along smoothly, the final cut [...] "didn't pass muster". Spotnitz explained that Carter [...] "spent a lot of time in the editing room trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this more terrifying."

500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, {{and it was as}} complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days figuring <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices.

Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven.

She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E

500|$|Nordby spent a {{significant}} amount of time shooting [...] "the articulating jaw" [...] scene because they had [...] "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, [...] "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough." [...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this a scary film as well as a funny film."

500|$|... "Something There" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken. According to Menken, [...] "Something There" [...] was written as [...] "a very quick replacement for ...

Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work and not {{take away from the}} central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence {{near the end of the}} film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work".|$|E
500|$|Due to Dual Destinies {{being made}} {{long after the}} {{previous}} main game in the series, the developers felt that they needed it {{to make a big}} impact; they knew from the start that they wanted Phoenix Wright to return as the game's main character and as an attorney, since they had hinted at it {{at the end of the}} previous game. Additionally, they wanted to retain Apollo Justice as an important character, and not steal the spotlight from him, as he had already been established as a new main character. Feeling that Apollo's story had not been explored enough in the previous game, they focused on developing his character further in Dual Destinies, and added the character Athena Cykes as his junior. Yamazaki created Athena to be an active partner for Phoenix, rather than a [...] "supporter in the background". The development team encountered problems while figuring <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the impact they wanted with the game with both Phoenix and Apollo, until they decided on the story concept of Phoenix and Apollo working to revive a collapsed trial system. From the start, Yamazaki knew that he wanted all three player characters to have their own motivations and purposes, which would play out throughout the game. At one point, he considered having five lawyers in the game, because of it being the fifth game in the series; he later called this idea crazy and overly ambitious, and felt that they had [...] "dodged a bullet" [...] by not using it.|$|E

In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup.

500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we had to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance {{between male and female}} characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Results from {{landmark}} diabetes {{studies have}} established A 1 C as {{the gold standard}} for assessing long-term glycemic control. However, A 1 C does not provide “real-time ” information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Real-time information provided by selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) represents an important adjunct to A 1 C, because it can differentiate fasting, preprandial, and postprandial hyperglycemia; detect glycemic excursions; identify hypoglycemia; and provide immediate feedback about the effect of food choices, physical activity, and medication on glycemic control. The importance of SMBG is widely appreciated and recommended as a core component of management in patients with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, as well as in diabetic pregnancy, for both women with pregestational type 1 and gestational diabetes. Nevertheless, SMBG in management of non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients continues to be debated. Results from clinical trials are inconclusive, and reviews fail to reach an agreement, mainly because of methodological problems.

40|$|Problem: Atlanta, Georgia faces {{significant}} transportation challenges. The {{city and}} surrounding region have grown rapidly. This rapid growth has produced traffic congestion and air pollution. Quality of life has suffered. Some {{people believe that}} Atlanta’s transportation-related problems are {{making it hard to}} attract businesses to locate in the region. Public transportation could help solve these problems, but expanding public transportation is costly. Investment in public transportation has been constrained over the years, following a period of relatively healthy levels of spending in the 1970 s and 1980 s. MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority), the region’s public transportation system, has been struggling financially. The state provides little support to public transportation. The Atlanta Regional Commission has proposed a plan to improve and greatly extend the existing public transportation system. The plan is very ambitious. It addresses many of the region’s public transportation needs. But it also is costly. At a time of high unemployment, falling tax revenues, and many demands on public budgets, the challenge of finding funding for Concept 3 is very great. Purpose: This study seeks to evaluate the prospects for funding Concept 3 and recommend what proponents of the plan might do to enhance the chances of success. Methods: This analysis surveys the factors that may come into play in determining whether or not Concept 3 might be implemented. It examines traffic congestion and air quality considerations, assesses public and opinion leader support for public transportation investment, considers possible funding approaches, and looks at the successes and failures of expansion in other transit systems in other major metropolitan areas. The analysis flows out of consideration {{of a wide range of}} materials, including studies by planners, think tanks, and public agencies and a wide range of other publicly available material. Results and Conclusions: Funding Concept 3 is an uphill climb. The scale of the investments required, the unmet financial needs of the existing public transportation in the Atlanta region, and the economic hard times argue against it. On the other hand, more public transportation could benefit much of the region’s population, both in terms of quality of life and in terms of jobs and economic growth. Also, while financial support for the existing system has not been at the level it needs to be, a new law passed in 2010 by the state legislature could be a vehicle for acquiring more transportation funding. In addition, support for more investment in public transportation comes from many quarters, so there are proponents who could if organized and committed for the long haul build broad support for new spending on public transportation. Most likely at least some part of Concept 3 will be implemented, but what parts and on what schedule remain uncertain. Takeaway for Practice: The business of planning is a long-term enterprise and involves more than producing creative, logical solutions to planning issues. It must also take into account getting the funding to put plans in motion. And that itself is probably far more complicated and difficult than producing a plan concept. Ultimately, a lot of people must agree that implementation makes sense, and the public as well as the politicians must be willing to provide the funding. Figuring <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> that happen and then having the commitment <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it happen over what might be a large part of a planner’s career can be – and usually are – tremendous challenges...|$|R
