40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of synthesis of (passive) mechanical <b>one-port</b> <b>networks.</b> One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of a device, which will be called the inerter, which is the true network dual of the spring. This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached. The possible application of the inerter is considered to a vibration absorption problem, a suspension strut design, and as a simulated mass.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{piecewise}} linear recursive convolution (PLRC) technique, FDTD modeling of Arbitrary linear lumped networks is studied in this paper, including <b>one-port</b> <b>networks</b> and two-port networks. Their general FDTD iterative formulations are obtained. Firstly, the admittance parameters in Laplace domain of lumped network are written as a summation form of several rational fractions; then the time domain admittance parameters {{can be obtained}} by means of inverse Fourier transform technique. Finally the time domain results are directly incorporated into the Maxwell-Ampere’s difference equation using the PLRC technique. It is worth pointing out that this approach preserves the second-order accuracy and the explicit nature of the conventional FDTD method. The proposed technique can be extended to model arbitrary linear multi-port lumped networks. To show the validity of the proposed algorithm, we analyze two microstrip circuits including lumped networks. The results are compared with those obtained from the Z-transform technique and the good agreement is achieved. 328 Chen and Chu 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We have {{proposed}} a simple waveguide method for complex permittivity determination of dielectric materials which are not completely filling the entire sample holder. The method reconstructs the permittivity from measured reflection-only scattering parameters by a <b>one-port</b> vector <b>network</b> analyzer of two configurations of the sample holder. It not only eliminates the necessity of any knowledge of {{the location of the}} shifted sample inside its holder but also decreases measurement errors occurring with the presence of undesired air gaps, which seriously affect the measurement accuracy of transmission-only measurements, present between the sample and holder walls. Furthermore, the reconstruction of permittivity can be realized by any <b>one-port</b> vector <b>network</b> analyzer, which is less expensive than their two-port counterparts. Therefore, the proposed method is cost-effective. We have analyzed the accuracy of the proposed method and noted a good compromise between the reference data and measured values of permittivities of low-loss polyvinyl-chloride and polytetrafluoro. ethylene samples (less than 8 percent for dielectric constant and less than 15 percent for loss tangent values). 1...|$|R

By modeling the utilized short, also the residual reflection tracking can be estimated.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} was to study uncertainty in an-tenna input impedance resulting from full <b>one-port</b> Vector <b>Network</b> Analyzer (VNA) measurements. The VNA process equation in the reflection coefficient ρ of a load, its meas-urement m and three errors Es, determinable from three standard loads and their measurements, was considered. Differentials were selected to represent measurement inac-curacies and load uncertainties (Differential Errors). The differential operator was applied on the process equation and the total differential error dρ for any unknown load (Device Under Test DUT) was {{expressed in terms of}} dEs and dm, without any simplification. Consequently, the dif-ferential error of input impedance Z-or any other physical quantity differentiably dependent on ρ- is expressible. Fur-thermore, to express precisely a comparison relation be-tween complex differential errors, the geometric Differen-tial Error Region and its Differential Error Intervals were defined. Practical results are presented for an indoor UHF ground-plane antenna in contrast with a common 50 Ω DC resistor inside an aluminum box. These two built, un-shielded and shielded, DUTs were tested against frequency under different system configurations and measurement considerations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{complexity}} of finding cost-optimal communication trees for rooted, irregular gather and scatter collective communication operations in fully connected, <b>one-ported</b> communication <b>networks</b> under a linear, but not necessarily homogeneous transmission cost model. In the irregular gather and scatter problems, different processors may specify data blocks of possibly different sizes. Processors are numbered consecutively, and data blocks shall be collected or distributed from some (given) root processor. Data blocks from and to processors can be combined into larger segments consisting of multiple blocks; but individual data blocks cannot be split. We distinguish between ordered and unordered problems and algorithms. In an ordered, irregular gather tree algorithm all non-leaf processors receive segments of data blocks for consecutively numbered ranges of processors. An unordered tree algorithm permits received segments to consist of blocks for processors in any order. We show that the ordered problems can be solved in polynomial time, and give simple dynamic programming algorithms to construct optimal communication trees for both gather and scatter problems. In contrast, we show that the unordered problems are NP-complete. We have implemented the dynamic programming algorithms to experimentally evaluate {{the quality of a}} recent, simple, distributed algorithm which constructs close to optimal trees. Our experiments show that it is indeed very close to the optimum for a selection of data block distributions, and likely sufficient for all practical purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} dissipativity is well {{developed}} for controllable systems. A more appropriate definition of dissipativity {{in the context}} of uncontrollable systems is in terms of the existence of a storage function, namely a function such that, along every system trajectory, its rate of change at each time instant is at most the power supplied to the system at that time. However, even when the supplied power is expressible in terms of just the external variables, the dissipativity property for uncontrollable systems crucially hinges on whether or not the storage function depends on variables unobservable/hidden from the external variables: this paper investigates the key aspects of both cases, and also proposes another intuitive definition of dissipativity. These three definitions are compared: we show that drawbacks of one definition are addressed by another. Dealing first with observable storage functions, under the conditions that no two uncontrollable poles add to zero and that dissipativity is strict as frequency tends to infinity, we prove that the dissipativities of a system and its controllable part are equivalent. We use the behavioural approach for formalising key notions: a system behaviour is the set of all system trajectories. We prove that storage functions have to be unobservable for lossless' uncontrollable systems. It is known, however, that unobservable storage functions result in certain fallacious' examples of lossless systems. We propose an intuitive definition of dissipativity: a system/behaviour is called dissipative if it can be embedded in a controllable dissipative superbehaviour. We prove embeddability results and use them to resolve the fallacy in the example termed lossless' due to unobservable storage functions. We next show that, quite unreasonably, the embeddability definition admits behaviours that are both strictly dissipative and strictly antidissipative. Drawbacks of the embeddability definition {{in the context of}} RLC circuits are finally related to the inability to realise/synthesise the special <b>one-port</b> electrical <b>network,</b> called the nullator, using only passive electrical components...|$|R
