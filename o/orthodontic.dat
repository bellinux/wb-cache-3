5|$|Small {{diameter}} implants are implants of low diameter {{with one}} piece construction (implant and abutment) that are sometimes used for denture retention or <b>orthodontic</b> anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). <b>Orthodontic</b> extrusion or <b>orthodontic</b> implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

25|$|The Invisalign system {{grew from}} 80,000 {{patients}} in 2002 to 175,000 in 2004. It won several awards for stereolithography, medical design and fast growth. Align Technology was profitable {{for the first}} time in 2003. In 2005 the company expanded into Japan, and acquired General <b>Orthodontic,</b> an orthodontics firm that supported doctors prescribing the Invisalign system. Later that year the Harvard School of Dental Medicine began requiring that its <b>orthodontic</b> graduate students complete Invisalign certification before they graduate.|$|E
25|$|Alveolar prognathism {{can also}} easily be {{corrected}} with fixed <b>orthodontic</b> therapy. However, relapse is quite common, unless {{the cause is}} removed or a long-term retention is used.|$|E

25|$|This is {{performed}} to realign the mandible (lower jaw) or maxilla (upper jaw) {{with the rest}} of the skull and/or teeth. This is usually performed to correct skeletal malocclusions, that is discrepancies in tooth position that cannot be corrected by simple <b>orthodontic</b> movement, and realignment of the temporomandibular joints, or to correct facial deformities such as mandibular retrognathia. There is little scarring, and all of the surgery takes places inside of the mouth. <b>Orthodontic</b> braces may have to be worn pre- and post- operation to realign the teeth to match the newly realigned jaw.|$|E
25|$|The CFT has an Orthodontist(s) {{who attends}} team {{meetings}} and whose education, {{training and experience}} have adequately prepared him/her for the <b>orthodontic</b> {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients with craniofacial anomalies or syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Clear aligners, {{also known}} as clear-aligner treatment, are <b>orthodontic</b> devices that uses {{incremental}} transparent aligners to adjust teeth {{as an alternative to}} dental braces. They are sold under at least five brand names, including ClearCorrect, Invisalign, and Orthoclear.|$|E
25|$|Poorly fitting {{dentures}} {{may cause}} {{pressure on the}} mucosa and mechanical irritation may create a similar clinical appearance, but this is uncommon. An <b>orthodontic</b> appliance may uncommonly produce a similar result. However, mucosal trauma is thought increase the ability of C. albicans to invade the tissues.|$|E
25|$|Many {{alternatives}} {{exist to}} secure the maxillary and mandibular dentition including resin bonded arch bars, Ivy loops (small eyelets of wires), <b>orthodontic</b> bands and MMF bone screws where titanium screws with holes in the head of them are screwed into the basal bone of the jaws then secured with wire.|$|E
25|$|Prognathism, if not {{extremely}} severe, can {{be treated}} in growing patients with <b>orthodontic</b> functional or orthopaedic appliances. In adult patients this condition can be corrected {{by means of a}} combined surgical/orthodontic treatment, where most of the time a mandibular advancement is performed. The same can be said for mandibular prognathism.|$|E
25|$|Common {{causes of}} oral {{ulceration}} include rubbing on sharp edges of teeth, fillings, crowns, false teeth (dentures), or braces (<b>orthodontic</b> appliances). Accidental biting {{caused by a}} lack of awareness of painful stimuli in the mouth (e.g., following local anesthetic used during dental treatment) may cause ulceration which the person becomes aware of as the anesthetic wears off and the full sensation returns.|$|E
25|$|A Sulcabrush {{is a type}} of {{toothbrush}} used {{specifically for}} cleaning along the gumline adjacent to the teeth. The bristles are usually shaped in a pointed arrow pattern to allow closer adaptation to the gums. A Sulcabrush is ideal for cleaning specific difficult-to-reach areas, such as between crowns, bridgework and crowded teeth. End-tufted brushes may also be used around fixed <b>orthodontic</b> appliances, such as braces.|$|E
25|$|The {{girl had}} {{orthodontics}} {{at one time}} when alive and may have removed the brackets from her teeth herself or by someone not affiliated with an <b>orthodontic</b> company. It was later confirmed that Cole had broken the braces from her teeth by herself before her disappearance. Investigators had difficulties with establishing {{the identity of the}} victim, as there were no means of identification present at the scene and there were no known witnesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{small round}} brush head {{comprises}} seven tufts of tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles {{in the center}} can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), <b>orthodontic</b> structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It {{can also be used}} to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to surgical crown lengthening is <b>orthodontic</b> forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage {{the bone and}} can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will only {{take a couple of}} months. A fiberotomy is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases such as this one shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally.|$|E
25|$|Various {{improvements}} {{were also}} made {{to health care}} provision and coverage during the social-liberal coalition’s time in office. In 1974, domestic aid during in-patient or in-patient cures was established, sick pay to compensate for wages lost while caring for a child was introduced, and the time-limit to in-patient care was removed. That same year, the cover of rehabilitation services was increased, together with the cover of dental and <b>orthodontic</b> services. Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975. in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.|$|E
25|$|One {{trial in}} {{adolescents}} who had <b>orthodontic</b> treatment comparing {{the removal of}} impacted mandibular wisdom teeth with retention was identified. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. The authors concluded {{that there is not}} enough evidence to support either the routine removal or retention of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association.|$|E
25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during <b>orthodontic</b> therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E
500|$|A {{dental implant}} (also {{known as an}} endosseous implant or fixture) is a {{surgical}} component that interfaces with the bone of the jaw or skull to support a dental prosthesis such as a crown, bridge, denture, facial prosthesis or {{to act as an}} <b>orthodontic</b> anchor. The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called osseointegration, in which [...] materials such as titanium form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an abutment is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic.|$|E
500|$|In orthodontics, small {{diameter}} dental implants, {{referred to}} as Temporary Anchorage Devices (or TADs) can assist tooth movement by creating anchor points from which forces can be generated. [...] For teeth to move, a force must be applied {{to them in the}} direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for <b>orthodontic</b> movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Masumoto et al. {{looked at}} the effects of chewing gum after meals {{following}} an <b>orthodontic</b> procedure, to see if chewing exercises caused subjects pain or discomfort, or helped maintain a large occlusal contact area. 35 adult volunteers chewed gum for 10 to 15 minutes before or after three meals each day for 4 weeks. 90% of those questioned said that the gum felt [...] "quite hard", and half reported no discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|A 1998 study {{suggested}} that breastfed babies {{have a better}} chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. It was thought that with fewer malocclusions, breastfed children may have a reduced need for <b>orthodontic</b> intervention. The report {{suggested that}} children with a well rounded, [...] "U-shaped" [...] dental arch, which is found more commonly in breastfed children, may have fewer problems with snoring and sleep apnea in later life. A 2016 review found that breastfeeding protected against malocclusions.|$|E

2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} therapies.

In particular they are indicated for [...] "mild to moderate crowding (1–6 mm) and mild to moderate spacing (1–6 mm)", in cases where there are no discrepancies of the jawbone. They are also indicated for patients who have experienced a relapse after fixed <b>orthodontic</b> treatment. [...] Despite patent infringement litigation, no manufacturer has obtained an injunction against another manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Orthodontists were {{resistant}} to adopting Invisalign at first, in particular because the founders had no <b>orthodontic</b> credentials or expertise, but the product became popular among consumers. In 2000 Align Technology planned a $31 million television advertising campaign that The New York Times said would be [...] "the most aggressive consumer advertising plan the dental profession has ever seen". The company raised about $140 million in funding over four rounds from 1997 to 2000. $130 million in additional funding {{was raised in}} 2001 through {{an initial public offering}} on NASDAQ. By 2001, 75 percent of the 8,500 orthodontists in North America had been trained on the Invisalign system. That same year, Align Technology made Invisalign available to general dentists following a class-action lawsuit that alleged making the system available only to orthodontists resulted in unfair competition for dentists.|$|E
