25|$|For {{many decades}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil was the biggest {{producer}} <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> virtual monopolist in the trade. However, a policy of maintaining high prices soon opened opportunities to other nations, such as Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Indonesia and Vietnam, now second only to Brazil as the major coffee producer in the world. Large-scale production in Vietnam began following normalization of trade relations with the US in 1995. Nearly all of the coffee grown there is Robusta.|$|E
2500|$|One classic hack {{involved}} {{a police car}} with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome.

[...] Its license plate read [...] "IHTFP", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. [...] A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> box of donuts. [...] Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the Stata Center as an all-time classic.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and have a cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> place to shop for gifts.|$|E

50|$|The name BeBe K'Roche {{was created}} by Pollet, {{inspired}} {{by the sight of}} a baby cockroach in <b>a</b> cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> attempt to lessen the impact by making it sound exotically French.|$|R

60|$|Bob {{followed}} the advice and, after a bath, a cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> biscuit, {{he no longer}} felt the effects from the shortness of the night. The sun had already risen, {{and there was not}} a cloud upon the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish ye would, Barney, for it {{is terribly}} hot and mosquito-bitten, and you couldn't have {{suggested}} anything more delightful. But here we are once more at our forest-home; and now for a magnificent cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mandioca-cake." ...|$|E
60|$|Boardman {{never made}} any sign of suspecting that he was put on and off, {{according}} to Dan's necessity or desire for comfort or congratulation; but {{it was part of}} their joke that Dan's coming to him always meant something decisive in his experiences.

60|$|I had Theodore's five francs in my pocket, and I {{was desperately}} hungry.

60|$|I {{then left}} him, and lighted {{a fire in}} the caboose.
