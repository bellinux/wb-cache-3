Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to <b>ongoing</b> <b>monitoring,</b> in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters.
