2500|$|While {{granting}} {{permission to}} file a certiorari petition, the US Supreme Court agreed to stay the Montana ruling, although Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote a short statement urging the Court [...] "to consider whether, {{in light of the}} huge sums of money currently deployed to buy candidate's allegiance, Citizens United should continue to hold sway". In June 2012, over the dissent of the same four judges who dissented in Citizens United, the Court simultaneously granted certiorari and summarily reversed the decision in American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock, 567, U.S. __ (2012). The Supreme Court majority rejected the Montana Supreme Court arguments in a two <b>paragraph,</b> twenty <b>line</b> <b>per</b> curiam opinion, stating that these arguments [...] "either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case." [...] The ruling makes clear that states cannot bar corporate and union political expenditures in state elections.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{guide to}} the most common forms of {{citation}} for books and articles. For more complex cases, use a reliable style manual such as Turabian, A Manual Of Style. Notes should be numbered consecutively from beginning to end of the paper and may be placed either at the bottom of each page or at the end of paper. Note numbers should be raised a half-space above the line of text. Normally <b>one</b> note <b>per</b> <b>paragraph</b> is sufficient. You may group all the sources for the paragraph, list them in order of occurrence, and separate each with a semicolon. Indicate a specific location for quotations. Single space within notes. Double space between notes. Notes always end with a period. Pp. (pages) is the plural form of p. (page). Publication facts are enclosed in parentheses in a note, but not in the bibliography. Bibliography entries should be grouped according to type. List primary and secondary sources separately. In a long bibliography, list books, articles, newspapers, unpublished manuscripts, etc. separately. The following examples show the format most commonly used for papers in the humanities. Minor variations in style appear in different manuals; choose one and b...|$|R
