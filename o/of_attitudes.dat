40|$|Recent {{research}} in the field of affect has highlighted the need to theoretically clarify constructs such as beliefs, emotions and attitudes, and to better investigate the relationships among them.

The data collected suggest a three-dimensional model <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> towards mathematics that includes students' emotional disposition, their vision of mathematics, and their perceived competence.

25|$|Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this {{influenced}} the logical positivists, who formulated {{the theory of}} emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but {{that they are a}} vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations.|$|E
25|$|The Reform Party's {{success in}} 1993 {{was related to}} the {{mobilization}} of people who were opposed to the welfare state, but this represents only one dimension of the party's appeal. Jenkins (2002) examines the effect of issues on Reform support during the campaign and considers the actual process by which issues affected party support. Although candidates can prime or stress certain issues for voters, the priming label is sometimes misused. Jenkins makes a distinction between campaign learning and priming. If voters do not know where a party stands on an issue, they cannot adequately employ this information in their overall evaluation. Evidence demonstrates that the increased importance <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward the welfare state was largely a function of the distribution of new information or learning, while the increased importance of cultural questions represented priming.|$|E

Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father. Some supporters of same-sex marriages take {{the view that the}} government should have no role in regulating personal relationships, while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.

40|$|An individual’s {{attitude}} {{has always been}} a core concept in IS research and a major determinant for individual technology adoption behavior. However, screening information systems (IS) and underlying social psychology literature reveals a one-dimensional view on attitude as evaluative affect in IS research compared to three classes <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> (affective, cognitive, and behavioral) in social psychology. In order to improve the theoretical and methodological understanding <b>of</b> <b>attitude,</b> the social psychological tripartite view on attitude is transferred to IS research. Based on the results of a linear regression and ANOVA with scientometric data coming from 378 measurements for attitude in 147 articles in IS top journals, the following insights could be outlined: Regarding hedonic systems, attitude should be scaled affectively, whereas the research subject of utilitarian IT applications demands a cognitive-based scaling <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> in order to increase predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>attitude.</b> Moreover, the adjustment of attitudinal scales according to the characteristics <b>of</b> the regarded <b>attitude</b> object (in IS: hedonic and utilitarian technologies), does influence the impact <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> on behavior. Implications, supporting future technology adoption research in handling the attitude construct, are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> {{the traditional}} <b>attitude</b> solution approach based on GPS (Global Position System) {{is to get}} the attitude matrix according to the relationship of coordinates.

This contribution presents a new approach <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> determination, in which the attitude angles are calculated by the double-difference carrier phase equation of GPS according to the relationship <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> matrix and attitude angles through least-squares estimate method.

25|$|From {{this period}} {{there are many}} {{examples}} of formal gardens created for nobles, gentry and lairds. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century there were at least 141 formal gardens and orchards in Scotland. The gardens of Aberdour Castle were redeveloped along with the building for the regent James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton (c. 1516–81), perhaps as an area for public display. Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555–1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries, designed for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584–1650), planted a herb garden at Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?–1610) created an enclosure of Renaissance-style walls, adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him. The change to walled gardens may have been because of a change <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> to smells, with the walls helping to intensify the scent of the herbs and flowers that grew there.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{influences}} of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances <b>of</b> <b>attitudes,</b> something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma’s performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize {{the lines of the}} body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form {{in the body of the}} performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.|$|E
