40|$|Local distinguishability of bipartite unitary {{operations}} {{has recently}} received much attention. A nontrivial and interesting question concerning this subject {{is whether there}} is a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> for locally discriminating between two bipartite unitary operations, because a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> usually represents the most economic strategy for discrimination. An affirmative answer to this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i) the unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on d⊗ d, i. e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were assumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in experiment. In this paper, we improve the result by removing the two limitations. Specifically, we show that any two bipartite unitary operations acting on d_A⊗ d_B can be locally discriminated by a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme,</b> without using the inverses of the unitary operations. Therefore, this paper enhances the applicability and feasibility of the <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> for locally discriminating unitary operations.

The learning can {{be based on a}} comparison of relative interaction energies or other integral characteristics of each interaction, for instance, chi-square distances between certain grey level difference or cooccurrence histograms collected over a given training sample. Parallel thresholding selects a basic structure of stronger, that is, more energetic or distant, interactions that is sufficient to model a specific class of stochastic textures introduced in [3, 4]. In many cases the basic structure is larger than is required because it contains not only the strong primary interactions but also the su ciently strong secondary interactions obtained by a statistical interplay of the primary ones. Empirical sequential learning proposed by Zalesny [6, 7] tends to exclude the secondary interactions so that the basic structure can be reduced in size and complemented with affine structure that describes minor but visually important repetitive details of a texture. The empirical <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> that involves a great body of computations can be approximated by less complex analytical and combined analytical-empirical <b>sequential</b> <b>schemes.</b> Experiments show that the sequential learning results in more precise Gibbs models of non-stochastic regular textures but does not improve (and sometimes may even deteriorate) the basic structure of stochastic textures...|$|R

For the class of finite-state schemes and other related families, we derive a deterministic performance bound, analogous to the classical (probabilistic) Minimum Description Length (MDL) bound.

It is shown that the bound can be attained both pointwise and sequentially for any model family in the reference class and without any prior knowledge of its order.

We consider an OFDMA {{model in which}} the feedback overhead is explicitly taken into account, given a fixed feedback rate and finite coherence time. The tradeoff between feedback rate and sum capacity is studied for two limited feedback schemes: a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> in which the users send compressed feedback bits over consecutive time slots, and a contention scheme in which users send their feedback via a random access protocol. For both schemes each feedback bit indicates {{a request for a}} group containing multiple subchannels. We show that the sum capacity for both schemes with optimized sub-channel groups grows linearly with the number of sub-channels N, and that the associated constant increases as the log of the normalized feedback rate measured in bits per coherence time per sub-channel. We also compare the asymptotic (large N) performance of the two limited feedback schemes {{as a function of the}} feedback rate and load (users per sub-channel). The <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> performs best with moderate to large feedback rates, or small loads, whereas the contention scheme performs best with small feedback rates or large loads...|$|R

The strategy evaluates soft sensor faults (biases) by examining and minimizing the sum of the squares of concerned mass or steady state energy balance residuals represented by the corrected measurement over a period. It considers systematically all the concerned energy balances and obtains the best estimates of the sensor biases by minimizing the sum of the mean squares of normalized residuals of all energy balances involved. The genetic algorithm technique is employed to determine the global minimal solution to the multimodal objective function, which can be difficult to achieve by traditional gradient-directed search methods.
