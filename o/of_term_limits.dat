5|$|James Garrard (January 14, 1749 – January 19, 1822) was {{a farmer}} and Baptist {{minister}} {{who served as}} the second governor of Kentucky from 1796 to 1804. Because <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> imposed by the state constitution adopted in 1799, he was the last Kentucky governor elected to two consecutive terms until the restriction was eased by a 1992 amendment, allowing Paul E. Patton's re-election in 1999.|$|E
25|$|As {{national}} voter sentiment favoring such limits gained strength, the Oregon Legislative Assembly considered broader imposition <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> in 1991, the Senate and House passing competing measures, {{but was unable}} to resolve {{the differences between the two}} bills, and rejected limiting congressional terms outright.|$|E

In 1998, Villaraigosa was chosen by his colleagues to be the Speaker of the Assembly, the first from Los Angeles in 25 years. He left the Assembly in 2000 because <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blackwell was the Republican {{nominee for}} Governor of Ohio in 2006. He beat state Attorney General Jim Petro in the 2006 Republican primary.

Blackwell was the first African-American to be nominated as a candidate for the Ohio governorship by either major political party.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Oregon Supreme Court stuck down Oregon's 1992 law {{imposing}} {{term limits}} for state legislators. Prior to the ruling, Starr {{would not have}} been able to run for re-election to the state senate as he had served 10 years in the legislature, and the law limited people to 12 years maximum. He had been a proponent <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits.</b> In 2002, he was re-elected to a second four-year term in the Senate where son Bruce was also elected to serve.

25|$|Chenoweth faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} in 1996 from Democratic activist Dan Williams, but was reelected {{in a close}} contest—most likely helped by Bob Dole easily carrying the 1st in the presidential election. Chenoweth defeated Williams again in 1998 by a wider margin. She later said that she regretted limiting herself to three terms and called the whole concept <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> bad policy. She nonetheless honored her pledge and did not run for reelection to a fourth term in 2000. She was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter, a fellow Republican. Since her retirement, no women have represented Idaho in either house of Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{commands}} of both fleets {{changed hands}} after Notium. Because <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> on {{the position of}} navarch, Lysander was replaced by Callicratidas; on the Athenian side, the fall of Alcibiades also brought down his friends Thrasybulus and Theramenes, and the overall command was given to Conon. Over the next year, the fleets clashed twice, first in a battle where, with twice as many ships as Conon, Callicratidas defeated the Athenians and trapped them in Mytilene; an Athenian relief fleet then decisively defeated and killed Callicratidas at Arginusae. These Athenian victories proved useless, however, for in 405 BC Lysander returned to unofficial command and destroyed the Athenian fleet at Aegospotami, thus ending the Peloponnesian War with Sparta the victor.|$|E

Jacob helped citizens in 23 states place limits on their congressional delegations, prompting columnist Robert Novak to call him [...] "the most hated man in Washington." [...] But on May 22, 1995, those state-imposed congressional <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> encompassing nearly half the U.S. Congress, were struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case <b>of</b> U.S. <b>Term</b> <b>Limits</b> v. Thornton. Today, 15 state legislatures, 36 governors and thousands of local officials, including those in nine of the country's ten largest cities, are under <b>term</b> <b>limits.</b> Jacob held several positions with U.S. <b>Term</b> <b>Limits</b> (including national director, senior fellow, and president), and currently serves on the organization's Board of Directors.|$|R

500|$|Suharto's {{previously}} {{strong relationship}} with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (Angkatan '66) were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections ("Golput" [...] movement), the costly construction of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists (Malari Incident of 1974), and lack <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Adnan Buyung Nasution, Hariman Siregar, and Sjahrir) and even sending army units to occupy university campus of ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology) from January–March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing decree on [...] "Normalization of Campus Life" [...] (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.|$|E

2500|$|On January 11, 2002, {{upholding}} {{a decision}} by Oregon Circuit Court Judge Richard D. Barber, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that enactment of Measure 3 had violated Article XVII, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution which prohibits multiple constitutional amendments combined in a single measure. [...] Again, the court refrained from addressing the broader issue <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits</b> themselves, confining itself to the matter of their having been enacted {{in violation of the}} [...] "separate vote" [...] provision of Oregon's constitution.|$|E

[...] It was silent on the broader issue of the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> nor did it address the matter of state offices, and thus the remaining provisions of Measure 3's amendment of the state constitution were left in place.|$|E

2500|$|Though a {{political}} novice, Burns {{had a great}} deal of name recognition from his previous jobs, and the Republican Party recruited him to run against Democrat and incumbent Senator John Melcher, a popular veterinarian.

[...] At the time a strong supporter <b>of</b> <b>term</b> <b>limits,</b> Burns said Melcher had been in Washington, D.C. too long. Melcher was also hurt by public opposition to policies in Yellowstone National Park regarding naturally occurring fires and by President Ronald Reagan's pocket veto of Melcher's bill, which would have made 1.4 million acres (5,700km²) of Montana forest off-limits to logging and mineral development. Burns defeated Melcher in a close race, 51-48 percent. He was helped by the success in Montana of Vice President George H. W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.|$|E
