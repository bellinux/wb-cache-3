The investigations concerning the influence of examination conditions, the type of faults and the vehicle age upon the results and reliability of diagnostic tests were carried out. The suitability of fault codes which were recorded in the memory of diagnostic system while the vehicle was operating have been determined as far as the recognition of the type of faults is concerned. Additionally, the examinations of engine on a test stand were carried out as well. Sensitivity of diagnostic systems was tested regarding the changes of work parameters of the engine.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} proved that {{elements}} of driverâ€™s behavior related to gear selec-tion have considerable {{influence on the}} fuel consumption. Optimal gear shifting is a complex task, especially for inexperienced drivers. This paper presents an imple-mented idea for gear shifting optimization {{with the aim of}} fuel consumption minimization with more efficient engine working regimes. Optimized gear shifting enables the best possible relation between vehicle motion regimes and engine work-ing regimes. New theoretical-experimental approach has been developed using <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> technology which so far has not been used for this purpose. The matrix of driving modes according to which tests were performed is obtained and special data acquisition system and analysis process have been developed. Functional relations between experimental test modes and adequate engine work-ing parameters have been obtained and all necessary operations have been con-ducted to enable their use as inputs for the designed algorithm. The created model has been tested in real exploitation conditions on passenger car with Otto fuel in-jection engine and <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> connection without any changes on it. The conducted tests have shown that the presented model has significantly positive ef-fects on fuel consumption which is an important ecological aspect.

2500|$|<b>On-board</b> <b>diagnostics</b> (OBD) is an {{automotive}} term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector, the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external scan tool. Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989â€“1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989â€“1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E

40|$|New {{emission}} legislations {{introduced in}} the European Union and the U. S. have made truck manufacturers face stricter requirements for low emissions and <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> systems. The <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system typically consists of several tests that are run when the truck is driving. One way to construct such tests is to use so called consistency relations. A consistency relation is a relation with known variables that in the fault free case always holds. Calculation of a consistency relation typically involves eliminating unknown variables from a set of equations. To eliminate variables from a differential polynomial system, methods from differential algebra can be used. In this thesis, the purely algebraic GrÃ¶bner basis algorithm and the differential Rosenfeld-GrÃ¶bner algorithm implemented in the Maple package Diffalg have been compared and evaluated. The conclusion drawn {{is that there are}} {{no significant differences between the}} methods. However, since using GrÃ¶bner basis requires differentiations to be made in advance, the recommendation is to use the Rosenfeld-GrÃ¶bner algorithm. Further, attempts to calculate consistency relations using the Rosenfeld-GrÃ¶bner algorithm have been made to a real application, a model of a Scania diesel engine. These attempts did not yield any successful results. It was only possible to calculate one consistency relation. This can be explained by the high complexity of the model...|$|R
