5|$|The United Kingdom's largest <b>onshore</b> {{wind farm}} (539MW) is at Whitelee in East Renfrewshire. The Clyde Wind Farm is a 548MW wind farm under {{construction}} near Abington, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, {{which will be}} Europe's largest <b>onshore</b> wind farm when completed. Two very large offshore wind turbines (5 MW each) {{are located in the}} Moray Firth. There are many other large <b>onshore</b> wind farms including some, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships <b>onshore</b> {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops <b>onshore</b> were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind <b>onshore</b> is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind <b>onshore</b> {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E
5|$|An 2012 EU {{study shows}} base cost of <b>onshore</b> wind power similar to coal, when {{subsidies}} and externalities are disregarded. Wind power {{has some of}} the lowest external costs.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature <b>onshore</b> cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an <b>onshore</b> wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Storm surge {{generally}} {{ranged from}} –, {{with the highest}} surge reported in Mobile Bay as winds became <b>onshore</b> during Dennis' landfall.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. <b>Onshore</b> wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small <b>onshore</b> wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex {{passes through}} the area {{affected}} by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash <b>onshore</b> portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) <b>onshore.</b> In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). <b>Onshore,</b> the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Only slight {{weakening}} {{took place}} as the typhoon skirted along the southern coast of Hainan Island. By October3, Brian had entered the Gulf of Tonkin and struck Vietnam later that day near Vinh with winds of 140km/h (85km/h). Rapid dissipation ensued once <b>onshore</b> and Brian eventually dissipated on October4 over the mountainous terrain of Laos.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when <b>onshore</b> storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already <b>onshore</b> by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the <b>onshore</b> Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed <b>onshore.</b> This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{reshape the}} geology near the coast by eroding sand {{from the beach}} as well as offshore, rearranging coral, and changing dune configuration <b>onshore.</b> Their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves, creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the <b>onshore</b> production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the <b>onshore</b> current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now <b>onshore,</b> could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{weakening}} {{occurred as}} Dot neared Hainan Island on June9. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June10 and weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its {{third and final}} landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once <b>onshore,</b> Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June12.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dolores was {{regarded}} as the worst hurricane to strike Acapulco since 1938. Developing on June13, 1974, the system rapidly organized into a tropical storm the next day off the southern coast of Mexico. Over the following day, Dolores developed an eye-like feature and attained hurricane status. With peak winds of 80mph (130km/h), the storm made landfall near Acapulco. Once <b>onshore,</b> Dolores rapidly dissipated and was last noted on June17.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes <b>onshore.</b> However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong <b>onshore</b> winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|On July22, the IMD began {{monitoring}} {{a depression}} over the Bay of Bengal. Tracking west-northwest, the system intensified into a cyclonic storm {{later that day}} before making landfall in Andhra Pradesh, just north of Vishakhapatnam. Once <b>onshore</b> the storm accelerated towards the northwest and weakened. By July24, {{the remnants of the}} cyclone were located over the state of Maharashtra. The system was last noted the following day over Gujarat and moving into Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Onshore,</b> civilians woke on {{the morning}} of 23 November to find that the most {{powerful}} ships in their navy, crewed by the lowest of the underclass, were firing on the city. Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power {{when compared to the}} {{environmental impact}}s of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or <b>onshore</b> turbines are being assessed. Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the <b>onshore</b> market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E
5|$|The harbour is very shallow {{in places}} and {{contains}} {{a number of}} islands, notably Brownsea Island, {{the birthplace of the}} Scouting movement {{and one of the few}} remaining sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England. The harbour, and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south, lie atop Western Europe's largest <b>onshore</b> oil field. The field, operated by Perenco from Wytch Farm, has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Waterspouts {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft, aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move <b>onshore.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{an average}} annual {{rainfall}} of , Cambridgeshire {{is one of the}} driest counties in the British Isles. Protected from the cool <b>onshore</b> coastal breezes east of the region, Cambridgeshire is warm in summer and cold and frosty in winter. Regional weather forecasting and historical summaries are available from the UK Met Office. The nearest Met Office weather station is Cambridge NIAB. Additional local weather stations report periodic figures to the internet such as Weather Underground, Inc.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} 17people, {{initially}} considered missing, rode {{out the storm}} on the offshore Mackerel Island. <b>Onshore,</b> officials closed a portion of Highway 1 {{as well as other}} roads in the area. Ahead of the storm, hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes, as well as an aborigine village near Onslow, were ordered to evacuate to safer locations. Five iron mines were closed during the storm's passage, forcing the 1,500workers to return home. The disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production. About 800,000barrels of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms. Oil fields reopened by 14April.|$|E
5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} gas {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply {{is coming from the}} Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas <b>onshore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also {{known as}} Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated from an {{area of low pressure}} over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. Within hours of moving <b>onshore,</b> the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved <b>onshore</b> northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield Moors is {{the site}} of a {{depleted}} <b>onshore</b> natural gas field located at a depth of 1450 feet (440 metres) below Hatfield Moor. The field was discovered in 1981 and contained about 8.5 billion cubic feet (241 million cubic metres) of gas in two formations Hatfield Moors and Hatfield West. Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc. As the field became depleted plans were made by ScottishPower in 1998 to develop the field for the storage of gas. These facilities became operational in February 2000. Edinburgh Oil and Gas have a 25-year agreement with ScottishPower giving them exclusive rights to inject, store and withdraw gas.|$|E
5|$|Later on October23, rapid {{weakening}} ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle {{took shape}} and wind shear increased. In the five hours up until landfall in Mexico, Patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water. However, it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00UTC near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and an analyzed pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.49inHg). This {{made it the}} most intense Pacific hurricane on record to strike Mexico. Once <b>onshore,</b> the high terrain of the Sierra Madre mountains accelerated Patricia's weakening. The low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled, with the latter accelerating northeast, and Patricia dissipated on October24 over central Mexico, less than 18hours after moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{has one of}} the world's largest {{reserves}} of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important {{reserves of}} chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant <b>onshore</b> heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E
5|$|On August14, Cindy {{passed over}} Martinique with rough winds and {{particularly}} violent rain, amplified by the storm's {{interaction with the}} rising terrain. The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of a line between Sainte-Marie and Fort-de-France, with day totals of more than 4in (100mm) recorded at every weather station in that region. The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in Le Prêcheur, totaling 5.79in (147mm) and 12.0in (305mm), respectively. These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29in (236mm), making Cindy {{one of the most}} extreme rain events in the island's history. A maximum gust of 40mph (65km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds <b>onshore</b> did not reach tropical storm force.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2008 a {{weakening}} surface trough extended across northern Florida, producing thunderstorms across the state. A weak {{low pressure area}} developed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on July 16 it crossed <b>onshore</b> near Tampa, and development was not anticipated due to land interaction. Late on July 17, however, convection increased {{in association with the}} low, and the system quickly became better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing, with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65miles (105km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|On July26, the typhoon turned {{towards the}} {{northwest}} and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck {{the southern coast}} of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205km (125mi) west of Pusan. Once <b>onshore,</b> rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July29 over the Sea of Japan.|$|E
