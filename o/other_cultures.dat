5000|$|The {{result is}} a {{training}} program that makes people more comfortable in working in the <b>other</b> <b>culture.</b> This was tested by assigning trainees randomly to two groups. One group gets the assimilator training, and the other gets geography training, such as what are the physical features of culture A. After the training the trainees go to the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} their interactions in that culture and the comfort they experience while they live in the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> is measured. The results show that the assimilator training is helpful. Training does not make the trainee an ambassador, that was too much to hope, but the trained individuals have a better experience in the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> {{than those who did not}} receive the culture assimilator training.|$|R

5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial.

5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{piercing}} of any body part had become uncommon in the West. After World War II, it began increasing in popularity among the gay male subculture. Even ear piercing for a time was culturally unacceptable for women, but that relatively common form of piercing began growing in popularity from the 1960s. In the 1970s, piercing began to expand, as the punk movement embraced it, featuring nontraditional adornment such as safety pins; and Fakir Musafar began popularizing it as a form of Modern Primitivism, which incorporated piercing elements from <b>other</b> <b>cultures,</b> such as stretching.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which are most evident in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly evident in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many <b>other</b> <b>cultures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs.

They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E

5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of <b>other</b> <b>cultures.</b> Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian {{culture and}} life {{revolves}} around food in every aspect, {{whether it is}} an ordinary day or a special occasion such as a wedding or holiday. Meals are structured in a cyclical order by Palestinians and span into two main courses and several intermediate ones like coffee, fruits and sweets as well as dinner. Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a {{time to spend with}} family and could last 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day. Unlike <b>other</b> <b>cultures,</b> lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E
5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize {{the role of the}} reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E
