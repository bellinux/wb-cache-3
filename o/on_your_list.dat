Every man who has felt the advantages of, or has received improvement in this place, carries its benefits into the society in which he moves, and puts them out at compound interest; and what the blessed sum may be at last, no man can tell. Ladies and gentlemen, with that Christian prelate whose name appears <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>list</b> of honorary Members; that good and liberal man who once addressed you within these walls, in a spirit worthy of his calling, and of his High Master--I look forward from this place, as from a tower, to the time when high and low, and rich and poor, shall mutually assist, improve, and educate each other.|$|E

[...] He enunciated distinctly, with soft precision. The deep, rolling tones of his voice filled the deck without effort. He was naturally scornful, unaffectedly condescending, as if from his height of six foot three he had surveyed all the vastness of human folly and had {{made up his mind}} not to be too hard on it. He went on:--"The captain shipped me this morning. I couldn't get aboard sooner. I saw you all aft as I came up the ladder, and could see directly you were mustering the crew. Naturally I called out my name. I thought you had it <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>list,</b> and would understand. You misapprehended." [...] He stopped short. The folly around him was confounded. He was right as ever, and as ever ready to forgive. The disdainful tones had ceased, and, breathing heavily, he stood still, surrounded by all these white men. He held his head up in the glare of the lamp--a head vigorously modelled into deep shadows and shining lights--a head powerful and misshapen with a tormented and flattened face--a face pathetic and brutal: the tragic, the mysterious, the repulsive mask of a nigger's soul.|$|E
