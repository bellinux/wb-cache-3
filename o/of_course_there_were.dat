Basil Clark is considered the founder of the public relations profession in Britain with his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924. Academic Noel Turnball points out that systematic PR was employed in Britain first by religious evangelicals and Victorian reformers, especially opponents of slavery. In each case the early promoters focused on their particular movement and were not for hire more generally.|$|E

While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation {{for his role in the}} production. Explaining this decision, he said, [...] "I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some elements from the show that had to be retained." ...|$|E
500|$|After slaking their thirst from {{a nearby}} stream, the crew {{unloaded}} the James Caird and spent the first night on South Georgia in a cave. The next day, Shackleton announced his intention to walk overland to the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness Bay, {{on the other side}} of the island. The crew were too exhausted, and the James Caird too battered, for Shackleton to consider sailing around the island. [...] The trek to Stromness Bay was [...] and after resting for several days, he, along with Worsley and Tom Crean, set out on 19 May. The interior of South Georgia was mountainous and covered with glaciers. Their map of South Georgia showed only the coastline, and on several occasions, they were forced to backtrack when their route was found to be impassable. After a non-stop trek of 36 hours, the trio reached Stromness Bay and were taken to the manager of the whaling station. He was unable to recognise Shackleton, whom he had met during the expedition's stopover on the island nearly two years previously. [...] After a hot bath and a large meal, Worsley set out on a whaler to collect the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. That night a strong blizzard struck the island. Had it developed while Worsley and the others were on their trek, it would have likely killed them. [...] They were fortunate the weather had been relatively good for their trek across the island. Later, all three trekkers would talk of a [...] "fourth presence" [...] that accompanied them. [...] In his account of the walk, Worsley would write [...] "...I again find myself counting our party—Shackleton, Crean, and I and—who was the other? <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only three, but it is strange that in mentally reviewing the crossing we should always think of a fourth, and then correct ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> many {{exceptions}} to these general practices. [...] A son might be named {{in honour of}} one of his maternal relatives, thus bringing a new name into the gens. [...] Because some gentes made regular use of only three or four praenomina, new names might appear whenever there were several younger sons. [...] Furthermore, a number of the oldest and most influential patrician families made a habit of choosing unusual names; in particular the Fabii, Aemilii, Furii, Claudii, Cornelii, and Valerii all used praenomina that were uncommon amongst the patricians, or which had fallen out of general use. [...] In the last two centuries of the Republic, and under the early Empire, it was fashionable for aristocratic families to revive older praenomina.|$|E

2500|$|Bismarck was {{the most}} memorable figure in Germany down to the 1930s. [...] The {{dominant}} memory was the great hero of the 1860s, who defeated all enemies, especially France, and unified Germany {{to become the most}} powerful military and diplomatic force in the world. [...] <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no monuments celebrating Bismarck's [...] devotion to the cause of European peace after 1871. [...] But there were other German memories. [...] His fellow Junkers were disappointed, as Prussia after 1871 became swallowed up and dominated by the German Empire. [...] Liberal intellectuals, few in number but dominant in the universities and business houses, celebrated his achievement of the national state, a constitutional monarchy, and the rule of law, and forestalling revolution and marginalizing radicalism. [...] Social Democrats and labor leaders had always been his target, and he remained their bête noire. Catholics could not forget the Kulturkampf and remained distrustful. Especially negative were the Poles who hated his Germanization programs.|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Irish poets {{have already}} been {{mentioned}} in connection with John Hewitt. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> others of some importance too, including Robert Greacen (1920–2008) who, along with Valentin Iremonger, edited an important anthology, Contemporary Irish Poetry in 1949. Greacen was born in Derry, lived in Belfast in his youth and then in London during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He won the Irish Times Prize for Poetry in 1995 for his Collected Poems, after he returned to live in Dublin {{when he was elected}} a member of Aosdana. Other poets of note from this time include Roy McFadden (1921–1999), a friend for many years of Greacen. Another Northern poet of note is Padraic Fiacc (1924- [...] ), who was born in Belfast, but lived in America during his youth. In the 1960s, and coincident with the rise of the Troubles in the province, a number of Ulster poets began to receive critical and public notice. Prominent amongst these were John Montague (born 1929), Michael Longley (born 1939), Derek Mahon (born 1941), Seamus Heaney (1939-2013), and Paul Muldoon (born 1951).|$|E
