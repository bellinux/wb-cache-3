25|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 November 1995 (12th of Heshvan on the Hebrew Calendar), Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist who opposed {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords. Rabin had been {{attending}} a mass rally at the Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv, held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital with considerable delay, where he died on the operating table less than 40 minutes later due to blood loss and a punctured lung. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres, was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1930s Knight befriended {{and painted}} groups of Gypsies at the Epsom and Ascot racecourses. Knight {{frequently}} {{returned to the}} racecourses and painted {{from the back of}} an antique Rolls-Royce car, which was large enough to accommodate her easel. Often pairs of Gypsy women would pose at the <b>open</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the Rolls-Royce, with the race-day crowds in the background. From Epsom Knight was invited to the Gypsy settlement at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Knight visited the Iver settlement, normally closed to outsiders, every day for several [...] months in the late 1930s. These visits resulted in a series of portraits of great intensity. Two women, in particular, sat a number of times for Knight, Lilo Smith, the subject of Old Gypsy Women (1938) and Gypsy Splendour (1939), and her daughter-in-law, Beulah. Gypsy Splendour was shown at the Royal Academy in 1939, the year Lilo Smith died.|$|E

40|$|In case of {{a burning}} train {{stopping}} outside the rescue stations in the Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT) the emergency ventilation system is used to provide a smoke-free environment in the opposite tube. The present paper discusses {{the performance of the}} emergency ventilation system with the simultaneous use of jet fans. In this way it is not a discussion of the superior, general safety concept, but it focuses exclusively on the relevant aspects with regard to a safe escape in {{case of a}}n incident train stopping near a portal. Calculations of the air flows in the tunnel system demonstrate that jet fans placed in tunnels near the portals are an efficient means to support the emergency ventilation system. The use of jet fans near the portals leads to 1. a more uniform level of flow velocity in the open cross-passages along the tunnel 2. increased air flow velocities in the <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> cross-passages, above the value which is required to prevent smoke from penetrating into the non-incident tube 3. a quicker response of the air flows in the <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> cross-passages to the ventilation 4. a lower sensitivity of the air flow in the <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> cross-passages to remaining train traffic. ...|$|R
