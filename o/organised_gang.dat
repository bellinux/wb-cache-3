50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Liverpool was tagged {{by the media}} as 'Smack City' or 'Skag City' after it {{experienced}} an explosion in <b>organised</b> <b>gang</b> crime and heroin abuse, especially within the city's more deprived areas. At the same time several criminal gangs began developing into drug dealing cartels in the city, including the Liverpool Mafia, {{which was the first}} such cartel to develop in the UK. As drugs became increasingly valuable, large distribution networks were developed with cocaine producers in South America, including the Cali cartel. Over time, several Liverpool gangsters became increasingly wealthy, including Colin 'Smigger' Smith, who had an estimated fortune of £200m and Curtis 'Cocky' Warren, whose estimated wealth once saw him listed on the Sunday Times Rich List.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{insurance}} fraud have perceived the crime {{as easy to}} commit, easily justified by those who do so (seeing insurers as ‘fair game’), and with a low chance of detection. Police interest has typically been perceived to be low. Although there are a range of studies of fraudsters, insurance fraudsters have largely escaped research attention. Little is known about {{their perceptions of the}} risks involved and why they choose to commit insurance frauds over other types of offences. The offences discussed by opportunistic insurance fraudsters were characterised by being spur of the moment decisions with little planning (and therefore involving no direct attempts to target an insurer), but being instigated because of a chance occurrence and a need and/or desire for money. Opportunities arose when a legitimate claim was being made and there was a chance to claim for more than legally entitled; when others introduced the idea; when it was easy to do; and because sometimes the fraudster was emotionally unstable. The opportunity to make money was a key driver. Given the lack of planning, the fraudsters did not consider the risk factors; concerns about getting caught before the offence took place did not feature prominently. None of the opportunistic insurance fraudsters claimed they had gained from their offences, moreover they said they suffered additional consequences beyond the caution or sentence they received. This included an adverse family reaction, financial consequences, and the stigma involved in being categorised as an offender. In acting quickly and without thought insurance fraudsters made mistakes. They were subsequently caught due to a variety of factors, including good work by insurers and the police. Some claimed they did not understand their policies. There seems much to be gained by highlighting the fact that opportunistic insurance fraudsters do get caught, and that there are consequences beyond those that stem from the conviction; and in reminding the public generally and policyholders specifically that insurance fraud has consequences and is not a victimless crime. Four individuals who were drawn into insurance frauds in different ways were interviewed. Lee became a ghost broker principally because it provided an easy way of deceiving people without them realising it. He exploited a range of loopholes including ignorance and carelessness amongst those he sold policies to. Matt orchestrated fraud from inside an insurance company. He had an addiction he could not deal with and was able to exploit Perpetuity Research and Consultancy International Ltd his inside knowledge with the help of colleagues and a friend who permitted fraudulent claims on his policy. Ahmed claimed to be ignorant and a victim himself of an <b>organised</b> <b>gang</b> of insurance fraudsters, although he was convicted of several offences. Alan was caught up in the police response to an <b>organised</b> <b>gang</b> of insurance fraudsters. He was innocent of the organised offences although he pleaded guilty to involvement in a different insurance related offence, albeit a minor one. The case studies highlight the ways in which fraudsters exploit public ignorance and carelessness and lax policies and practices by insurers, and the dangers for those who come too close to organised offences. They highlight the importance to those responsible for prevention to be continually on their guard, and on the ball, as offenders seek and exploit a range of easy opportunities...|$|E

This chapter looks at the various ways some groups, particularly women, are drowned out by <b>organised</b> <b>gangs,</b> forced out through tactics such as doxxing and swatting, or simply forced offline through repeated abuse and harassment.

The presumption of an 'international dimension' is important as it implies that those 'being trafficked' might very well be brought into the UK from elsewhere by criminal <b>organised</b> <b>gangs.</b> Our research reveals a different scenario in which trafficking and abuse of children is not recognised because it presents in ways that are different...|$|R
