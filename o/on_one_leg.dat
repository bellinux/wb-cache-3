5|$|Philip Morrison {{was born}} in Somerville, New Jersey, November 7, 1915, the only son of Moses Morrison and Tillie Rosenbloom. He had a younger sister, Gail. The family moved to Pittsburgh when he was two. He {{contracted}} polio when he was four, {{and as a result}} wore a calliper <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> and spent his last years in a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth and}} final bout {{of the main}} card was the UFC Welterweight Championship match between Georges St-Pierre and B.J. Penn, {{regulated}} by referee Herb Dean. The bout started out with the two fighters clinching and throwing knees. St-Pierre dropped down for a single-leg takedown but Penn defended while standing <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> {{with his back to}} the cage. Unable to get the takedown, St-Pierre let go and connected with a right hand punch. They met up and clinched in the middle of the cage with St-Pierre pushing Penn towards the fence. There, St-Pierre attempted a takedown but went back the clinch when he was unable to finish it. The two fighters continued trading punches to end the first round.|$|E

5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E

25|$|When Roman Šebrle was {{six years}} old, he started playing football, but also {{occasionally}} took part in athletics competitions. In 1987 he broke his calf bone and shin bone <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> in a collision with the opponent goalkeeper during a football match. After this incident he had his leg in plaster for 2 months and spent one year learning to walk.|$|E
25|$|A crane {{standing}} <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> (usually with a stone held in {{the other}} foot) may be called vigilant or in its vigilance (e.g. Waverley Borough Council's Crane in its vigilance). A stone is usually shown {{held in the}} claw of the raised leg. This is as per the Bestiary myth that Cranes stayed awake by doing so. If it dozed, the Crane would supposedly drop the rock, waking itself up.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "goose step" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} a British military drill in which <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> at a time was swung back and forth without bending the knee. Apparently, standing <b>on</b> only <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> reminded soldiers of how geese often stand. The term was later applied to the German stechschritt during World War I. As a result, term has acquired a pejorative meaning in some English-speaking countries.|$|R
25|$|In 1978, {{two young}} hikers, while walking on Monte Musinè near Turin, saw a bright light; {{one of them}} {{temporarily}} disappeared and, after a while, {{was found in a}} state of shock and with a noticeable scald <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b> After regaining consciousness, he reported having seen an elongated vehicle and that some strangely shaped beings descended from it. Both the young hikers suffered from conjunctivitis for some time.|$|E
25|$|If {{the male}} becomes alarmed {{enough to leave}} the nest, he will attempt a {{distraction}} display. This usually involves a fake injury display, {{similar to that of}} the killdeer. To do this, he will hop <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> and attempt to fly, always falling down. He will perform this display if the eggs have not hatched or the chicks are still too young to fly. It is generally believed that tinamous are not as effective at distraction displays as other birds.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{strain on}} a tendon can damage its {{collagen}} fibers. This is most commonly seen in performance horses that gallop or jump, who usually strain a tendon {{as a result}} of fetlock overextension when their weight is loaded <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b> The overextension of the fetlock causes overstretching of the flexor tendons, resulting in the rupture of tendon fibers. Horses in intense training, especially those that were not conditioned properly, may damage many collagen fibers. This may occur gradually or suddenly.|$|E
60|$|Keegan {{was sitting}} on the bench {{immediately}} under that of the barrister, among the attorneys employed in court. When he heard Mr. O'Malley's request to the judge, he rose up <b>on</b> his <b>one</b> <b>leg,</b> and the judge having ordered him to leave the court, he hobbled out with the assistance of his crutch.|$|R
50|$|When {{rotating}} <b>on</b> either <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> or two, {{the body}} requires reducing friction. Raising to <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> is often <b>one</b> source of doing this, although since it doubles the {{weight on the}} other leg, it is not effective, so is mainly done when the other leg is used to torque to increase a spin, or very quickly so that the mass is more in the air, and has not settled on the other foot.|$|R

25|$|The first {{depiction}} of ice skating {{in a work}} of art was made in the 15th century. The picture, of Saint Lidwina, patron saint of ice skaters, falling on the ice was the first work of art to feature ice skating as a main theme. Another important aspect of the painting is a man seen in the background, who is skating <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg.</b> This means that the ice skates the man was wearing must have sharp edges similar to those found on modern ice skates.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 {{then head}} of the {{religion}} `Abdu'l-Bahá took a journey to the West from what was then Palestine. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> of his trips {{as he was leaving}} Canada, {{on the way back to}} the States, and he traveled through several villages. As the train passed through the town of Belleville, Ontario, a four-year-old Mohawk boy, Jimmy Loft, was sitting on a fence as the train passed. `Abdu'l-Bahá took that moment to stand up and, facing the window, smile and wave. Loft was so surprised he toppled off the fence. In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bahá'ís of Canada.|$|E

50|$|A goal from Jon Macken, who {{had just}} signed a {{permanent}} deal to return to Oakwell after his loan spell, sealed Barnsley's first league win since early December to re-affirm the teams strong home record.

25|$|In 1920, she resumed {{acting in}} her theater, usually {{performing}} single acts of classics such as Racine's Athelee, {{which did not}} require much movement. For her curtain calls, she stood, balancing <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> and gesturing with one arm. She also starred in a new play, Daniel, written by her grandson-in-law, playwright Louis Verneuil. She played the male lead role, but appeared in just two acts. She took the play and other famous scenes from her repertory on a European tour and then for her last tour of England, where she gave a special command performance for Queen Mary, followed by {{a tour of the}} British provinces.|$|E
25|$|The fleet {{moved to}} the attack on November 7, after more delays caused by the weather during which {{additional}} troops were brought into Fort Walker. Flag Officer Du Pont ordered his ships to keep moving in an elliptical path, bombarding Fort Walker <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg</b> and Fort Beauregard on the other; the tactic had recently been used effectively at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. His plan soon broke down, however, and most ships took enfilading positions that exploited a weakness in Fort Walker. The Confederate gunboats put in a token appearance, but fled up a nearby creek when challenged. Early in the afternoon, most of the guns in the fort were out of action, and the soldiers manning them fled to the rear. A landing party from the flagship took possession of the fort.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{attitude of}} beasts is rampant (i.e. standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised {{as if to}} strike). Beasts also frequently appear walking, passant or, {{in the case of}} stags and the occasional unicorn, trippant, and may appear statant (standing), salient or springing (leaping), sejant (seated), couchant or lodged (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally dormant (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is displayed (i.e. facing the viewer with the head turned toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear rising or rousant (i.e. wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), volant (flying), statant (standing, with wings raised), close (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear naiant (swimming), while cranes may appear vigilant (standing <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>leg).</b> Fish often appear naiant (swimming horizontally) or hauriant (upwards) or urinant (downwards), but may also appear addorsed (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear glissant (gliding in a wavy form) or nowed (as a figure-eight knot). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear segreant (i.e. rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear combatant (i.e. two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).|$|E
