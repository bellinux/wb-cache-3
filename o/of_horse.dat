5|$|The Carolina Marsh Tacky or Marsh Tacky {{is a rare}} breed <b>of</b> <b>horse,</b> {{native to}} South Carolina. It {{is a member of}} the Colonial Spanish group <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeds, which also include the Florida Cracker Horse and the Banker horse of North Carolina. It is a small horse, well adapted for use in the lowland swamps of its native South Carolina. The Marsh Tacky {{developed}} from Spanish horses brought to the South Carolina coast by Spanish explorers, settlers and traders as early as the 16th century. The horses were used by the colonists during the American Revolution, and by South Carolinians for farm work, herding cattle and hunting throughout the breed's history.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic {{horse is}} a breed <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> {{developed}} in Iceland. Although the horses are small, at times pony-sized, most registries for the Icelandic {{refer to it}} as a horse. Icelandic horses are long-lived and hardy. In their native country they have few diseases; Icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return. The Icelandic displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The only breed <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> in Iceland, they are also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native country, as well as for leisure, showing, and racing.|$|E

5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of trucks}} was {{constrained}} {{by the lack of}} fuel and high costs of synthetic gasoline on the German side, and the losses of equipment in 1941–1942 on the Soviet side. The Soviets managed their losses with the formation <b>of</b> 76 <b>horse</b> transport battalions <b>of</b> 500 <b>horses</b> each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population <b>of</b> <b>horses,</b> but then it declined again as farm horses were replaced by motor power.|$|R

5|$|At the Restoration, {{infantry}} regiments {{and a few}} troops <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> {{were established}} and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerrilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Pikemen became less important and after {{the introduction of the}} socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,250 men. The Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars. Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs. There were now Royal Navy patrols in Scottish waters even in peacetime. Scottish privateers played a major part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In the 1690s a fleet of five ships was established for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy of three warships to protect local shipping. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. At the Union, the standing army was seven units of infantry, two <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> and one troop <b>of</b> <b>Horse</b> Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in a series of wars on the European continent. The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms became more conventional as the rebellions progressed.|$|E

Besides Tennessee Walking Horses, she painted other breeds <b>of</b> <b>horse,</b> as well as landscapes. Her paintings were made into prints and transferred onto china and other objects.

5|$|During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse {{ownership}} {{was more}} widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered {{a decline in}} the harsh economic environment of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and then sell it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain for hundreds of years by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567– 1625), but he brought the sport as it is known today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603– 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type <b>of</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyse the numbers and division <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed. At the present time this group is the most numerous in the entire population <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> <b>Horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed do not come under any breeder union which would provide reports about these horses; these horses are only registered and breeders are informed only about their numbers. Our study is the first to deal with the problem of increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed. The database contained 22   211 horses not entered registered in any of the stud books. In the database we filed approved horses born between 1972 and 1 September 2012 and horses registered from 1987. The data were processed in the Excel programme and results were evaluated in graphs. The most frequent horse in this group was the warm-blood type (n = 9   303), pony type (n = 6   285), cold-blooded type (n = 2   663) and unlisted horses (n = 2   278). Since 2001 the number <b>of</b> registered <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed has increased. The most numerous dams <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed is the Czech warm-blood with 1   912 offspring; dams of the English Thoroughbred with 552 offspring and mares of the utility Huzule horse with 492 offspring. In the group <b>of</b> registered <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed the Czech warm-blood appears in the pedigree of 507 colts and the American Paint Horse in the pedigree of sires of 506 colts. Why the numbers <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed are increasing is the boom of leisure horsemanship and unqualified horse breeding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nuchal ligaments from midwestern U. S. horses {{infected}} with adult Onchocerca sp. were studied. The prevalence of Onchocerca sp. infection in horses increased with age. Ten percent <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> {{less than one}} year old were infected, 28 % <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> one to five years old, 48 % <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> six to 15 years old, and 90 % <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> over 16 years old. Lesions in Onchocerca sp. -infected nuchal ligaments varied with age <b>of</b> the <b>horse.</b> Horses less than five years old had few or no lesions, whereas most horses six to 15 years old had focal mineralization and granuloma formation around adult worms. In infected nuchal ligaments <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> over 16 years old, mineralization was much greater and fewer normal parasites were found. Our data suggest that infection by viable parasites is terminated naturally. Equine onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection <b>of</b> <b>horses,</b> with world-wide distribu-tion, caused by a filiarial worm of the genus Onchocerca. The adults of Onchocerca cervicalis, Railliet and Henry 1910, are found in the ligamentous tissue adjacent to the nuchal attachment of the thoracic vertebral spinous processes and in and around the supraspinous bursa.
