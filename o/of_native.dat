In the 1990 s the drop can be attributed both to increased out-migration <b>of</b> <b>natives</b> (native flight) and decreased in-migration <b>of</b> <b>natives</b> (native avoidance). In 2000 - 2007, native flight appears to be driving the segregation pattern.

40|$|Learning {{about the}} impact of {{immigration}} on the labor market outcomes <b>of</b> <b>natives</b> is a topic of major concern for immigrant-receiving countries. Using data from Spain, where the immigrant population has risen from 4 % to 13 % within a decade, we find that immigration appears to have affected the task specialization <b>of</b> <b>natives</b> without affecting their employment levels. However, the impact of immigration on the relative task supply <b>of</b> <b>natives</b> is twice as great in Spain as in the United States. The magnitude of the immigration impact in a country with a large share of immigrants originating from Spanish-speaking countries suggests that host country language proficiency is not the sole factor driving the observed impact. Additionally, the analysis reveals significant gender differences in the impact of immigration on the relative task supply <b>of</b> <b>natives,</b> possibly resting on the occupational concentration <b>of</b> immigrants and <b>native</b> occupational segregation patterns by gender, among other factors.

Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling.
