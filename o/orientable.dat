25|$|All polyhedra with odd-numbered Euler {{characteristic}} χ are non-orientable. A given {{figure with}} even χ < 2 {{may or may}} not be <b>orientable.</b> For example, the one-holed toroid and the Klein bottle both have χ = 0, with the first being <b>orientable</b> and the other not.|$|E
25|$|Fundamental {{groups of}} closed <b>orientable</b> {{two-dimensional}} manifolds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orientable</b> {{surfaces}} can be visualized, {{and their}} diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two <b>orientable</b> surfaces, one can {{determine if they}} are diffeomorphic by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are diffeomorphic {{if and only if}} the genera are equal, so the genus forms a complete set of invariants.|$|E
25|$|The Euler {{characteristic}} of any closed odd-dimensional manifold is also 0. The case for <b>orientable</b> examples is a corollary of Poincaré duality. This property applies more generally to any compact stratified space all of whose strata have odd dimension. It {{also applies to}} closed odd-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, via the two-to-one <b>orientable</b> double cover.|$|E
25|$|If the {{manifold}} is not <b>orientable,</b> {{changing the}} sign of b'i has no effect.|$|E

25|$|Every {{manifold}} has an <b>orientable</b> double {{cover that}} is connected if {{and only if}} the manifold is non-orientable.|$|E
25|$|A {{manifold}} is <b>orientable</b> {{when the}} top-dimensional integral homology {{group is the}} integers, and is non-orientable when it is 0.|$|E
25|$|Note that Sp(n) ⊂ SU(2n) ⊂ U(2n) ⊂ SO(4n), {{so every}} hyperkähler {{manifold}} is a Calabi–Yau manifold, every Calabi–Yau manifold is a Kähler manifold, and every Kähler manifold is <b>orientable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, a {{comparability}} graph is an {{undirected graph}} that connects pairs of {{elements that are}} comparable {{to each other in}} a partial order. Comparability graphs have also been called transitively <b>orientable</b> graphs, partially orderable graphs, and containment graphs.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} a closed surface is determined, up to homeomorphism, by {{two pieces of}} information: its Euler {{characteristic}}, and whether it is <b>orientable</b> or not. In other words, Euler characteristic and orientability completely classify closed surfaces up to homeomorphism.|$|E
25|$|For an <b>orientable</b> bundle, {{the second}} Stiefel–Whitney class {{is in the}} image of the natural map H2(M, Z) → H2(M, Z/2Z) (equivalently, the {{so-called}} third integral Stiefel–Whitney class is zero) if and only if the bundle admits a spinc structure.|$|E
25|$|Let , where knbsp&ge&nbsp&2, be the {{standard}} {{presentation of the}} fundamental group of a closed <b>orientable</b> surface of genus k. Then for the symmetrization of this presentation the only pieces are words of length 1 and this symmetrization satisfies the C'(1/7) and C(8) small cancellation conditions.|$|E
25|$|A complex {{projective}} algebraic curve {{resides in}} n-dimensional complex projective space CPn. This has complex dimension n, but topological dimension, {{as a real}} manifold, 2n, and is compact, connected, and <b>orientable.</b> An algebraic curve over C likewise has topological dimension two; in other words, it is a surface.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{this shows}} {{that there is no}} smooth {{retraction}} from any non-empty smooth <b>orientable</b> compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes's theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form ω generates the de Rham cohomology group H'n−1(∂B) used in the cohomology proof.|$|E
25|$|For polyhedra with self-crossing faces, {{it may not}} {{be clear}} what it means for {{adjacent}} faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra it is still possible to determine whether it is <b>orientable</b> or non-orientable by considering a topological cell complex with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.|$|E
25|$|Like the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle is a {{two-dimensional}} manifold {{which is not}} <b>orientable.</b> Unlike the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle is a closed manifold, meaning it is a compact manifold without boundary. While the Möbius strip can be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, the Klein bottle cannot. It can be embedded in R4, however.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, strengthenings of the {{conjecture}} {{that involve}} colorings of the cycles in the cover {{have also been}} considered. The strongest of these is a conjecture that every bridgeless graph has a circular embedding on an <b>orientable</b> manifold in which the faces can be 5-colored. If true, this would imply a conjecture of W. T. Tutte that every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 5-flow.|$|E
25|$|This theorem is {{a special}} case of Thurston's orbifold theorem, {{announced}} without proof in 1981; it forms part of his geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds. In particular it implies that if X is a compact, connected, <b>orientable,</b> irreducible, atoroidal 3-orbifold with non-empty singular locus, then M has a geometric structure (in the sense of orbifolds). A complete proof of the theorem was published by Boileau, Leeb & Porti in 2005.|$|E
25|$|If M admits {{an almost}} complex structure, {{it must be}} even-dimensional. This {{can be seen as}} follows. Suppose M is n-dimensional, and let J:TM→TM be an almost complex structure. If J 2=−1 then det(J)2=(−1)n. But if M is a real manifold, then det(J) is a real number- thus n must be even if M has an almost complex structure. One can show that it must be <b>orientable</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{stronger}} {{version of}} the circular embedding conjecture that has also been considered is the conjecture that every biconnected graph has a circular embedding on an <b>orientable</b> manifold. In terms of the cycle double cover conjecture, this {{is equivalent to the}} conjecture that there exists a cycle double cover, and an orientation for each of the cycles in the cover, such that for every edge e the two cycles that cover e are oriented in opposite directions through e.|$|E
25|$|As another example, {{the graph}} of the {{icosahedron}} is a double cover of the complete graph K6; to obtain a covering map from the icosahedron to K6, map each pair of opposite vertices of the icosahedron to a single vertex of K6. However, the icosahedron is not bipartite, {{so it is not}} the bipartite double cover of K6. Instead, it can be obtained as the <b>orientable</b> double cover of an embedding of K6 on the projective plane.|$|E
25|$|Every Riemann {{surface is}} a {{two-dimensional}} real analytic manifold (i.e., a surface), but it contains more structure (specifically a complex structure) which {{is needed for}} the unambiguous definition of holomorphic functions. A two-dimensional real manifold {{can be turned into}} a Riemann surface (usually in several inequivalent ways) if and only if it is <b>orientable</b> and metrizable. So the sphere and torus admit complex structures, but the Möbius strip, Klein bottle and real projective plane do not.|$|E
25|$|In fact, any compact {{surface that}} is either <b>orientable</b> {{or has a}} {{boundary}} can be embedded in E3; on the other hand, the real projective plane, which is compact, non-orientable and without boundary, cannot be embedded into E3 (see Gramain). Steiner surfaces, including Boy's surface, the Roman surface and the cross-cap, are models of the real projective plane in E3, but only the Boy surface is an immersed surface. All these models are singular at points where they intersect themselves.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} example to the {{classification}} of compact 2-manifolds is {{the classification of}} compact Riemann surfaces, i.e., compact complex 1-manifolds. (Note that the 2-sphere and the torus are both complex manifolds, in fact algebraic varieties.) Since every complex manifold is <b>orientable,</b> the connected sums of projective planes are not complex manifolds. Thus, compact Riemann surfaces are characterized topologically simply by their genus. The genus counts the number of holes in the manifold: the sphere has genus 0, the one-holed torus genus 1, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings. However, {{this is not the}} best drawing for minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most once, so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has <b>orientable</b> genus 1.|$|E
25|$|Every closed <b>orientable</b> surface admits {{a complex}} structure. Complex {{structures}} on a closed oriented surface correspond to conformal equivalence classes of Riemannian metrics on the surface. One {{version of the}} uniformization theorem (due to Poincaré) states that any Riemannian metric on an oriented, closed surface is conformally equivalent to an essentially unique metric of constant curvature. This provides {{a starting point for}} one of the approaches to Teichmüller theory, which provides a finer classification of Riemann surfaces than the topological one by Euler characteristic alone.|$|E
25|$|Some ideas {{underlying}} the small cancellation theory {{go back to}} the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s. Dehn proved that fundamental groups of closed <b>orientable</b> surfaces of genus at least two have word problem solvable by what is now called Dehn's algorithm. His proof involved drawing the Cayley graph of such a group in the hyperbolic plane and performing curvature estimates via the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a closed loop in the Cayley graph to conclude that such a loop must contain a large portion (more than a half) of a defining relation.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted in}} the preamble, all Riemann surfaces, like all complex manifolds, are <b>orientable</b> as a real manifold. The reason is that for complex charts f and g with {{transition}} function h = f(g1(z)), h {{can be considered as}} a map from an open set of R2 to R2 whose Jacobian in a point z is just the real linear map given by multiplication by the complex number h(z). However, the real determinant of multiplication by a complex number α equals |α|2, so the Jacobian of h has positive determinant. Consequently, the complex atlas is an oriented atlas.|$|E
25|$|The flux of {{secondary}} particles and X-ray and gamma-rays of atmospheric origin {{produced by the}} interaction of the cosmic rays is very low. This low background, in the presence of which one has to detect the feeble signal from cosmic sources is a major advantage in conducting hard X-ray observations from India. The second advantage is that many bright sources like Cyg X-1, Crab Nebula, Scorpius X-1 and Galactic Centre sources are observable from Hyderabad due to their favourable declination. With these considerations, an X-ray astronomy group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an <b>orientable</b> X-ray telescope for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources including Cyg X-1 and Her X-1, and the diffuse cosmic X-ray background were studied. Many new and astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.|$|E
