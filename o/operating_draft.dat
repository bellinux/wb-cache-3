40|$|The {{determination}} of motion response characteristics, and therefore operating limits, of semisubmersibles in normal even keel conditions {{has been extensively}} reported in the literature. However, the extension of this work to vessels which have undergone some form of damage leading to loss of buoyancy and abnormal heel and trim angles is limited. [...] to establish the motion response of a typical semisubmersible in both even keel and damage conditions, and resulting changes relative to severity and direction of damage, a model study using a 1 / 100 scale model of a moored, four column, twin pontoon semisubmersible has been conducted. For each wave direction of head, beam and quartering seas, tests were undertaken at five angles of trim and heel: even keel; two towards (windward damage), and two away (leeward damage) from the waves in 7 m regular seas with periods of 7 to 25 sec. In all cases {{six degrees of freedom}} motion response was obtained. [...] The RAO curves for small angles of trim and heel show little change from even keel, <b>operating</b> <b>draft.</b> However, at large angles, with pontoons and deck structure piercing the water surface, substantial increases in roll and, particularly pitch motion, occurred over a band of wave periods of 9 to 13 sec. Over this band all motions contained not only the wave frequency but also a significant subharmonic component at half the wave frequency. Under these conditions leeward damage consistently produced the largest motion. The most extreme motion measured resulted in a pitch RAO of 2. 9 or 19. 8 ° for a wave height of 6. 9 m at a wave period of 12 sec. in quartering seas. [...] Further work using realistic irregular seas to obtain additional insight into nonlinear effects over the subharmonic or parametric resonance frequency band has been recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a concept evaluation of novel station keeping concept for offshore vertical axis wind turbines based on the well-known tension leg platform (TLP) principle. The main characteristic of this concept is the two-stage approach of installing the turbine offshore. In general terms the concept consists of four major components: the turbine, cylindrical floater, submerged docking station {{and an array of}} vertical top tensioned tethers. The idea behind this concept is that the docking station is towed out to the field and attached to the tethers prior to the float out operation of the turbine. The turbine is towed out on separate cylindrical floater, which is mated to the docking station, situated at a certain depth below sea level. The top-tensioning of the tendons is achieved in two stages, first by de-ballasting the docking station to maintain a level of pre-tension prior to the mating procedure with the turbine floater. The turbine floater, which also maintains a certain mass of temporary ballast to achieve <b>operating</b> <b>draft,</b> is later used to achieve the desired pre-tension for the operating condition after installation. This concept was applied for patenting in Norway by Prof. A. Nergaard on 31 st June 2009 and granted 20 th September 2010 (Patent no. 329254). In this thesis the aim was to determine a set of promising floaters and docking stations by assessing relevant parameters based on spreadsheet calculations. The key considerations here were sufficient pre-tension capacity and stability in float out for a vertical axis wind turbine with a rated power of 2. 3 MW. Adjustments were made to the principal dimensions such as the diameters, drafts, pontoon radii and ratios of permanent ballast to temporary ballast to achieve stable floaters and docking stations that satisfied a set of design criteria. Due to limited available research on this particular concept, the design criteria were set based on existing information on horizontal axis wind turbine TLPs, along with several engineering assumptions. In general terms the work presented in this thesis cover three principal stages: spreadsheet analysis of parameters, hydrodynamic modelling and dynamic simulation in one operational and extreme sea state. The parameter study resulted in the selection of three cases with combined displacements ranging between 6047 and 9811 m 3, with associated pre-tension capacities per tendon between 5. 3 and 10 MN. Following the selection of cases, work was done to determine the frequency dependent added mass and potential damping properties of each case along with the specification of load and displacement RAOs. These properties were used to create a new set of vessels in OrcaFlex to assess the motion characteristics and tendon tension for the two aforementioned environmental conditions. The analysis conducted in this thesis was limited to linear effects only, i. e. second order effects were neglected. The {{objective of}} the thesis was to evaluate this concept based on the results obtained from the dynamic simulation in terms of loads at the floater-docking station connection, the tension in the tendons under both environmental conditions and assess the motion characteristics of each case. The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in slack tendons in the severe sea state corresponding to a 50 - year storm, which indicated that the selected cases did not satisfy the requirement for this type of station keeping concept. Despite the fact that none of the cases were sufficient to survive the storm, some trends were uncovered for possible further work on this concept to reach a suitable combination of parameters. The main problems that were found for this concept was the bending moment at the connection between the floater and docking station, and the occurrence of slack. In the 50 -year storm, maximum bending moments between 270 and 320 MNm were found, exceeding the capacity of standard collet connectors, which was the envisioned connection method in this thesis. In regards to slack tendons, it was found here that an increased pontoon radius (> 35 m) would yield significantly improved results in terms of avoiding slack, which coincided with the studied literature. A reduction in draft of the floater component, which in this thesis ranged between 50 and 60 m, would also result in improvements for both the connection load and the loss of tension in the downwind tendon. Higher pre-tension was also found to give lower variation in tendon load, coinciding with the studied literatur...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{significant}} amount of kinetic energy comes out of runner in reaction turbines and the draft tube is used to recover this kinetic energy into useful pressure energy. The energy recovery in draft tube depends on its design and magnitude of velocity components at runner exit. Further the amount of kinetic energy coming out of runner depends on the solidity of runner {{as well as its}} rotational speed. Hence draft tube is important component of turbine next to runner. In this paper, 3 D viscous turbulent flow simulation has been done in the complete flow passage of Francis turbine using commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code for three runner solidities at different rotational speeds.

Simulation results analysis confirm the choice of IEEE 802. 11 p as the ideal technology for data short-range communications (DSRC) when compared to other variants of the generic IEEE 802. 11 standard as well as the technique used to reduce the handover delays, which, if left untreated, would be a serious hindrance to the optimal performance of vehicular applications...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{topographic}} map in 1966, {{remote sensing image}} in 1988 and land use survey in 2000, three land use maps were made in Yangou watershed. And assisted by spatial analysis techniques of GIS, the spatial and temporal differentiation of land use change was analyzed in that watershed. As a result, this paper found: (1) Land use change of Yangou watershed could be divided into three phases from 1949 to 2000. The main character of prophase (1949 - 1988) was that slope land was expansively cultivated and natural forestland was continuously destroyed. The land use structure of the watershed was steady comparatively in 1989 to 1996. The key period of regulating land use structure of the watershed was in 1997 to 2000. Land use structure during the period showed sharp changes along with the reduction of vast farmland, a speedy increase in orchard and got-up grassland and a increase in open woodland. (2) During 1997 to 2000, the important measures of regulating land use structure of the watershed included formulating the <b>operating</b> rules, <b>drafting</b> the practicable plan, regulating the land use structure based on the topographic slopes, selecting and fostering rural industries and playing the rational roles of administrators, researchers and farmers.

50|$|By 1942, the Selective Service System {{moved away}} from {{administrative}} selection by its more than 6,000 local boards {{to a system of}} lottery selection. Rather than filling quotas by local selection, the boards now ensured proper processing of men selected by the national lottery. On December 5, 1942, presidential Executive Order 9279 made it so that men from the ages of 18 to 37 could not voluntarily enlist even if they had not been drafted, providing protection for the nation's home front manpower pool. Paul V. McNutt, head of the War Manpower Commission, estimated that the changes would increase the ratio of men drafted from one out of nine to one out of five. The commission's goal was to have nine million men in the armed forces by the end of 1943. This facilitated the massive requirement of up to 200,000 men per month and would remain the standard for the length of the war.

5000|$|During World War II, {{there was}} no legal {{way to avoid the}} draft, and failure to obey was treated as insubordination, punished by {{execution}} or jail. Draft evaders were forced to escape to the forests and live there as outlaws, in what was called facetiously serving in the käpykaarti (Pine Cone Guard). 1,500 men failed to show up at the draft {{at the start of the}} Continuation War, and 32,186 cases of desertion were handled by the courts. There were numerous reasons: fear or war-weariness, objection to the war as an offensive war, ideological objections or outright support for Communism. However, Communists that considered dangerous were subject to [...] "protective custody", in practice detention in a prison for the course of the war. The käpykaarti was a diverse group including draft evaders, deserters, Communists and Soviet desants. They lived in small groups, sometimes even in military-style dugouts constructed from logs, and often maintained a rotation to guard the camp. They received support from sympatizers who could buy from the black market, or failing that, stole provisions to feed themselves.

50|$|He founded The Intimate Theatre in Stockholm in 1907. His theatre {{was modeled}} after Max Reinhart's Kammerspiel Haus. Strindberg had the {{intention}} of the theatre being used for his plays and his plays only, he also had {{the intention of}} the theatre being used mainly to perform chamber plays. For the theater's opening, Strindberg wrote four chamber plays: Thunder in the Air, The Burned Site, The Ghost Sonata, and The Pelican. Strindberg had very specific ideas about how the theatre would be opened and <b>operated.</b> He <b>drafted</b> a series of rules for his theatre in a letter to August Falck: 1. No liquor. 2. No Sunday performances. 3. Short performances without intermissions. 4. No calls. 5. Only 160 seats in the auditorium. 6. No prompter. No orchestra, only music on stage. 7. The text will be sold at the box office and in the lobby. 8. Summer performances. Falck helped to design the auditorium, which was decorated in a deep-green tone. The ceiling lighting was a yellow silk cover which created an effect of mild daylight. The floor was covered with a deep-green carpet, and the auditorium was decorated by six ultra modern columns with elaborate up-to-date capitals. Instead of the usual restaurant Strindberg offered a lounge for the ladies and a smoking-room for the gentlemen. The stage was unusually small, only 6 by 9 metres. The small stage and minimal amount of seats was meant to give the audience a greater feeling of involvement in the work. Unlike most theatres at this time, the Intima Teater was not a place in which people could come to socialize. By setting up his rules and creating an intimate atmosphere, Strindberg was able to demand the audience's focus. When the theatre opened in 1907 with a performance of The Pelican it was a rather large hit. Strindberg used a minimal technique, as was his way, by only having a back drop and some sea shells on the stage for scene design and props. Strindberg was much more concerned with the actors portraying the written word than the stage looking pretty. The theatre ran into a financial difficulty in February 1908 and Falck had to borrow money from Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke, who attended the première of The Pelican. The theatre eventually went bankrupt in 1910, but did not close until Strindberg's death in 1912. The newspapers wrote about the theatre until its death; however, Strindberg felt it was entirely unsuccessful. He felt that he never had the opportunity to successfully stage a play the way he wanted to - which was the purpose of the theatre in the first place.|$|R

The four composite panels consisted of two quasi-isotropic 16 ply AS- 1 carbon fiber reinforced polyetherether ketone (PEEK) matrix thermoplastic panels in a (45 / 90 /- 45 / 0) 2 s stacking sequence and two quasi-isotropic 16 ply TR 50 S carbon fiber reinforced TC 27501 epoxy resin thermoset panels in a (45 / 90 /- 45 / 0) 2 s stacking sequence. The thermoset and thermoplastic panels were cut into twelve 152. 4 mm x 101. 6 mm samples each and underwent impact testing on the tower per ASTM D 7136 standards. 6. 7 J/mm is the specified ratio of impact energy to specimen thickness for D 7136 testing, and when coupled with the (thermoset) samples’ average thickness of about 2. 47 mm equated to a 314. 9 mm impactor drop height and lower. After impact samples were non-destructively inspected and displayed near a 0. 8 mm dent-depth with an 11. 15 mm maximum damage diameter. Damage types included a depression, splitting, cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The thermosets’ damage measurements and types were compared to the thermoplastic samples’ damages and found to be less damaged topically but more damaged internally...|$|R
