40|$|We have {{developed}} an instrument to perform local oxidation nanofabrication processes in parallel. The instrument has three major components, the <b>stamp</b> <b>holder,</b> the sample base, and the supporting frame. The sample base is actuated by three precision screws that enable motion in the three orthogonal directions. Sample base and <b>stamp</b> <b>holder</b> are enclosed and sealed inside a chamber with two inlets to introduce different gases. The chamber {{is supported by a}} rigid frame. We show the parallel patterning of silicon oxide features on silicon surfaces by the application of a bias voltage between the sample and the stamp when they are in contact. Arrays of parallel lines separated by 100 nm have been patterned over cm 2 regions in one minute.
