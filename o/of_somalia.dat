5|$|The Transitional Federal Government was internationally {{recognized}} as the government <b>of</b> <b>Somalia</b> until August 2012, when it {{was replaced by the}} Federal Government <b>of</b> <b>Somalia.</b> It was established in 2004 as a successor to the now defunct Transitional National Government, and currently occupies Somalia's seat in the United Nations. The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation <b>of</b> <b>Somalia,</b> and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces are fighting to quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern half of the country, as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.|$|E

5|$|The Transitional Federal Government, {{formed in}} 2004, was {{recognized}} as the central government <b>of</b> <b>Somalia.</b> Before December 2006, the TFG controlled only the town of Baidoa, the sixth largest city.

The TFG was at the time not able to effectively collect taxes, had no notable finances or real power base, and struggled to exert control over Mogadishu following an attempted move in late December 2006. However, the TFG later succeeded in capturing most <b>of</b> <b>Somalia</b> from insurgents, but struggled to cement its control and establish law and order.|$|E
