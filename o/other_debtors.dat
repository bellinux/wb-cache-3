25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, DeStefano {{was a leading}} loan shark for the Outfit. DeStefano's loan shark victims {{included}} politicians, lawyers and small-time criminals; {{by the end of}} the decade, DeStefano was charging 20% to 25% a week in interest. DeStefano would accept very high-risk debtors, such as drug addicts or business men who had already defaulted on previous debts. The reason was simple: DeStefano enjoyed it when debtors did not pay on time, since he could then bring them to the sound-proof torture chamber he had built in his basement. Other gangsters said the sadistic DeStefano would actually foam at the mouth while torturing his victims. From time to time, DeStefano would also kill debtors who owed him small sums just to scare <b>other</b> <b>debtors</b> into paying their bigger debts.|$|E

40|$|Interest {{payments}} on Australia’s foreign debt are decomposed into real and inflationary components using the Fisher relationship, and the inflation component {{is treated as}} an implicit repayment of foreign debt. As a consequence, {{the size of the}} current account deficit and capital inflow are reduced by the value of this implicit capital repayment. It is demonstrated also that the flow of domestic savings is increased by the amount of the implicit capital repayment. Further, the size of these adjustments have increased during the 1980 ’s, and these increases have probably been more marked in Australia than in many <b>other</b> <b>debtor</b> countries. ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} situations where a claim is extinguished by operation of law. If two persons are jointly but not severally liable {{for a simple}} contract debt, a judgment at common law obtained against {{only one of the}} debtors works as an extinguishment of the claim on the <b>other</b> <b>debtor</b> as a matter of law. A conveyance of mortgaged land by the mortgagor to the mortgagee extinguishes the mortgage. However taking a promissory note for the amount due on the mortgage does not deprive the mortgage holder of a right to a lien, but merely suspends its enforcement until the note is payable.|$|R

500|$|As {{the debt}} crisis {{expanded}} beyond Greece, these economists continued to advocate, albeit more forcefully, the disbandment of the eurozone. If this was not immediately feasible, they recommended that Greece and the <b>other</b> <b>debtor</b> nations unilaterally leave the eurozone, default on their debts, regain their fiscal sovereignty, and re-adopt national currencies. Bloomberg suggested in June 2011 that, if the Greek and Irish bailouts should fail, an alternative would be for Germany to leave the eurozone to save the currency through depreciation instead of austerity. The likely substantial fall in the euro against a newly reconstituted Deutsche Mark would give a [...] "huge boost" [...] to its members' competitiveness.|$|R

40|$|Highlighting that France and Germany held largely contradicting {{hopes and}} {{aspirations}} for Europe's common currency, this paper analyzes how the resulting euro contradiction conditioned the ongoing euro crisis {{as well as}} current strategies to resolve it. While Germany generally prevailed in hammering out {{the design of the}} euro policy regime, the German authorities have failed to see the inconsistency in their policy endeavors: the creation of a model whose workability presupposes that others behave differently cannot be made to work by forcing everyone to behave like Germany. This fundamental misunderstanding has made Germany the main culprit in the euro crisis, but it has yet to face the full consequences of its actions. Germany had sought every protection against the much-dreaded euro transfer union, but its own conduct has made that very outcome inevitable. Conversely, having been disappointed in its own hopes for the euro, France is now facing the prospect of a lost generation - a prospect, shared with <b>other</b> <b>debtor</b> nations in the union, that has undermined the Franco-German alliance and may soon turn it into the ultimate euro battleground...|$|R

5000|$|Credit scoring is {{the process}} of using a {{proprietary}} mathematical algorithm to create a numerical value that describes an applicant's overall creditworthiness. Scores, frequently based on numbers (ranging from 300-850 for consumers in the United States), statistically analyze a credit history, in comparison to <b>other</b> <b>debtors,</b> and gauge the magnitude of financial risk. Since lending money to a person or company is a risk, credit scoring offers a standardized way for lenders to assess that risk rapidly and [...] "without prejudice." [...] All credit bureaus also offer credit scoring as a supplemental service.|$|E
5000|$|Collection {{agencies}} are sometimes allowed to contact individuals <b>other</b> than the <b>debtor,</b> usually {{in an attempt}} to locate the debtor but without mentioning the debt. In the United States, the FDCPA allows a collector to call a neighbor or relative for help in locating the debtor, but they may only ask for [...] "address, home phone number, and place of work" [...] and are [...] "not permitted to discuss the debt with anyone <b>other</b> than <b>debtor,</b> their spouse, or their attorney". The debtor can give permission to the collection agency to speak to somebody else besides the above-mentioned. Collectors must state their name and must give the name of their employer if the person specifically asks. They may only contact each person once, unless it is believed that the person gave the collector incorrect or incomplete information at the time, but now has complete or updated information. Collectors may contact a debtor at the workplace unless the collector has been informed the employer prohibits such calls.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{externalities}} associated with the individual developing country’s cost of credit and borrowing level. As long as the supply curve of credit is positively sloped, the interest rate charged on credit extended to a particular developing country {{is affected by the}} aggregate borrowing level {{of the rest of the}} countries. Moreover, the relatively high level of indebtedness of big developing countries and their problems to service their external debts, might adversely affect the reputation of the developing countries as a whole and reduce their financial credibility. The estimation of the interest rate equations confirms the significant role of these externalities in explaining the cost of credit to individual countries in the three distinct developing regions of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, since the individual country 2 ̆ 7 s information about the borrowing of the <b>other</b> <b>debtor</b> countries is not perfect, this country perceives the interest rate on loans taken as a random variable, and hence might suffer from substantial costs of risk bearing. The implications of this type of externality on the borrowing behaviour of developing countries are analyzed within the context of a stochastic framework in which countries borrowing large amount of money behave like Stackelberg leaders. The estimation of the derived borrowing equations are found to be statistically significant in the cases of Latin America and Asia-Pacific...|$|R
50|$|The {{collapse}} of the Scali house was also due to other factors. In particular, the Scali had been competing with other Italian houses for one of Europe's most attractive markets: England's wool. By 1326, the sovereign owed the Scali alone some 400,000 florins (the equivalent of England's yearly budget). The fall {{of the house of}} Scali led the <b>other</b> Italian <b>debtors</b> of Edward III to abandon their all-out competition for an alliance. These attempts to strengthen their positions failed and less than twenty years later the other two large Italian banks involved with the English crown had gone bankrupted.|$|R
50|$|As in <b>other</b> countries, certain <b>debtors</b> may {{be tempted}} to bypass the process {{outlined}} above through the transfer of assets from an insolvent company to a phoenix company, thus abandoning outstanding liabilities to creditors.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the United States (U.S.) legal {{community}} {{arrived at a}} consensus that the traditional common law distinctions were obsolete and served no useful purpose. They tended to generate too much unnecessary litigation about whether the creditor had selected the correct type of security interest. There was a growing recognition that {{the different types of}} security interests had developed only because on the one hand, many judges thought there was something inherently wrong with allowing a person, either out of desperation or foolishness, to summarily encumber all his or her personal property as collateral for a loan, but on the <b>other,</b> <b>debtors</b> and creditors would attempt to reach a desired result by any means necessary, even if that meant resorting to creating multiple security interests to cover different types of personal property. There was also the problem of the above-mentioned early English cases that regarded such security interests as fraudulent conveyances and failed to recognize that they had legitimate uses in a modern industrial economy. Therefore, because the very history of security interests demonstrated that judicial resistance to enforcing broad security interests would not stop debtors from trying to give them as inducement to creditors to extend financing, and that they were socially useful under the proper circumstances, the better choice was to make the law of security interests as clear and simple as possible.|$|E

50|$|Consolidation loans have longer terms than <b>other</b> loans. <b>Debtors</b> {{can choose}} terms of 10 - 30 years. Although the monthly {{repayments}} are lower, {{the total amount}} paid over the term of the loan is higher than would be paid with other loans. The fixed interest rate is calculated as the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, assigning relative weights according to the amounts borrowed, rounded up to the nearest 0.125%, and capped at 8.25%. Some features of the original consolidated loans, such as postgraduation grace periods and special forgiveness circumstances, are not carried over into the consolidation loan, and consolidation loans are not universally suitable for all debtors.|$|R

40|$|Education {{loan debt}} in the U. S. {{recently}} reached $ 1. 2 trillion. Thirty-nine million Americans [...] nearly 20 % of U. S. households [...] owe student loans, and student loans {{are by far}} the fastest growing component of non-housing consumer debt. For example, in fourth quarter 2013, U. S. households incurred $ 82 billion in debt (exclusive of housing debt), a 3. 3 % increase from the previous quarter. Of this amount, $ 53 billion (65 %) was student loan debt. In contrast, auto loans and credit card debt accounted for only $ 29 billion. Student loan debt is also a rapidly increasing element in consumer bankruptcy. This study examines the growth of student loan debt, income, and other types of debt in consumer bankruptcy cases filed each year from 2005 to 2013. For this study, I obtained data from 500 randomly-selected cases per year (4500 cases in total). Among my findings, the percentage of debtors with student loan debt increased from 15. 7 % in 2005 to 22. 3 % in 2013, while the average student loan debt load for such debtors more than doubled from $ 15, 350 to $ 32, 096 during the same period. I also present regression analyses (coefficients of determination) for each year comparing student loan debt with total overall debt, and with monthly income. The analysis shows that debtors who have borrowed for education have similar levels of debt and income as <b>other</b> <b>debtors.</b> In other words, borrowing for education does not translate into higher income or greater affluence. Finally, I provide basic growth rates charts tracking annual percentage changes in total debt, income, and student loan debt. The charts show that the yearly growth rate of student loan debt consistently exceeds that of income and other types of debt. This suggests that the growth of student loan debt in the U. S. is on an unsustainable trajectory...|$|E

40|$|When a {{high rate}} of {{indebtedness}} like ours is combined with the deterioration of the labour market, the financial situation of some families can become worse. To test these hypotheses, the Consumer Indebtedness Observatory started a research project to study the relation between unemployment and over-indebtedness in Portugal. Two empirical studies, based largely on personal interviews, are being carried out: one involves workers who have lost their jobs; the <b>other</b> involves <b>debtors</b> who sought the assistance of DECO to renegotiate their debts with creditors. Based on this, we can identify two general profiles which we have termed, as in a fable, the grasshopper and the ant.
