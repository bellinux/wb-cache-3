6000|$|... "See here--" [...] blustered Flockley. But he got no further, for Dick {{suddenly}} wheeled {{him around}} {{and gave him}} a shove that sent him through <b>the</b> doorway and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch.</b>|$|R
60|$|Keith thought himself too big {{to betray}} any joy over a Christmas dinner, but he whistled while doing the chores until the bare welkin in the yard rang, and Teddy, in spite of unheard of misdemeanours, was not {{collared}} <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> once.|$|R
60|$|Eddie {{was down}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> in an instant, and making for the ranchhouse.|$|E
60|$|He stamped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> {{his huge}} spurs rattling, {{and started down}} the path toward the waiting men.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gale looked helplessly {{from this}} strangely calm and cold {{son to the}} restless Belding. Then Dick strode <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} erected in the mid-12th century in romanesque style. The walls are constructed of raw boulders with ashlar in the corners, windows and doorways. The north wall has two preserved, original windows while the north {{door and a}} window on the east wall has been walled <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> church <b>porch</b> was built in 1871-72 in place of an older half-timbered building and in 2005 <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> was widened to make the original granite reliefs visible.|$|R
50|$|Joe and Linda Wingo founded Angel Food Ministries in 1994 in Monroe, Georgia. They {{started the}} half charity and half {{business}} to help 34 families struggling financially by dispensing 34 boxes <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> {{of his home}} when numerous industrial plants closed in their community. Joe Wingo was a pastor at a local church the Emmanuel Praise Center in Monroe.|$|R
6000|$|Grandmother said he might: and so Caleb ran <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> at <b>the</b> back door, {{and took}} down quite a large bell, which was hanging there. Caleb stood upon {{the steps of}} <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> and {{grasping}} <b>the</b> great handle of the bell with both hands, he rang it with all his might. In {{a minute or two}} he stopped; and then he heard a faint and distant [...] "Aye-aye" [...] coming, from a field. Caleb put the bell back into its place, and then went again to his grandmother.|$|R
60|$|August Naab, bareheaded, with shaggy locks shaking {{at every}} step, strode <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and his great hands lifted Hare from the saddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go now," [...] she continued, {{and moved}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Then she hesitated, and turned {{with a smile}} that was wistful and impulsive. [...] "I--I believe we'll be good friends." ...|$|E
60|$|Cole tensed, {{suddenly}} alert. There {{was something}} in the man's eyes, a hardness, a piercing look. Cole moved back <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> onto the path. He had to be careful. Something was wrong.|$|E
50|$|Located in {{the space}} created by the setback of the brick wing, the front entry stairs are built into the masonry base. The stairs {{terminate}} in a small entry porch, a timber framed, flat roofed structure with a timber-battened valence that {{is attached to the}} western end of the enclosed verandah. A door opens <b>off</b> <b>the</b> entry <b>porch</b> directly into <b>the</b> stone core of the building. A steel framed stair links the lower level of the open front verandah with the side garden.|$|R
50|$|The house {{passed to}} Peter Hageman (c1890-1943) in 1933, {{after the death}} of his grandmother. Peter was the Franklin Township Tax Collector from 1928 until his death in 1943; his wife assumed his duties, {{continuing}} for another 24 years from the house. For nearly 40 years, <b>the</b> large room <b>off</b> <b>the</b> south <b>porch</b> served as <b>the</b> Tax Collector's office. Peter's son, Garretson Hageman continued to live on the farm with his family until 1972, when the land was condemned for the proposed Six Mile Run Reservoir.|$|R
6000|$|At {{sight of}} Master Simon, the {{landlord}} was evidently a little flurried, {{and began to}} rub his hands, edge away from his corner, and make several profound publican bows; while the orator took no other notice of my companion than to talk rather louder than before, and with, as I thought, something of an air of defiance. Master Simon, however, as I have before said, sheered <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> and passed on, pressing my arm within his, and whispering, as we got by, {{in a tone of}} awe and horror, [...] "That's a radical! he reads Cobbett!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no news to me--where your heart's located," [...] laughed Bo. Then she ran <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> to see {{the blue}} mustang. She walked round and round him, {{clasping}} her hands in sheer delight.|$|E
60|$|Columbine heard {{approaching}} {{voices and}} the thumping of hasty feet. That unclamped her cloven tongue. Wildly she screamed. Old Bill Belllounds appeared, striding <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> And the hunter Wade came {{running down the}} path.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm off. He is {{not going}} to escape if I can help it." [...] And so speaking, the {{youngest}} Rover dashed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the cottage and in the direction from whence he had come.|$|E
5000|$|The {{home was}} placed on the register, in part, due to it being an almost {{pristine}} example of plantation plan architecture. The chimneys and much of the clapboards are original. The kitchen, on the back of <b>the</b> house, <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> was rebuilt. <b>The</b> two front bedrooms originally had separate entrances for each. The rooms have been referred to as [...] "traveler's rooms", [...] "preacher rooms" [...] and [...] "stranger's rooms". The Gachet house was known as a stagecoach stop in its history. Benjamin Gachet died at age 36 leaving several minor children and Mrs. Gachet likely earned a living to support her children by operating this stagecoach stop.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Diana and Eric meet at {{his brother}} Greg's house where they have sex. They then drive to a ranch together. The next morning at the ranch, they have sex again; the ranch manager James (Don Hampton) {{interrupts}} them, but doesn't see anything. Diana becomes nervous that James is going to call Eric's father and that she could lose her job if he finds out. Diana then says she thinks they should put their relationship on hold for a while. She goes <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> to be alone, Eric joins her and attempts to be close she reacts with shocking ferocity yelling [...] "What's the matter with you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The complex {{continued}} {{functioning as}} a plantation into the 20th century. The two back wings of the manor house were removed, widening the back balcony, and a back kitchen wing was added <b>off</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> remaining plantation complex consists of the [...] "big house" [...] with several outbuildings, including six original slave quarters, and a maison de reprise (a second house or mother-in-law cottage). The existence of the slave quarters, which workers continued to live in until 1977, contributes to the historic significance of the complex. Because of its importance, it has been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is used to interpret history and for heritage tourism.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Worthington {{coughed and}} pulled {{at one of}} his mutton-chop whiskers, and seemed about to step <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> again. It was, indeed, the first citizen and {{reformer}} of Brampton. No wonder William Wetherell was mystified.|$|E
60|$|The hall door below {{opened and}} shut. Footsteps thumped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{and out to}} the street. Lane heard the giggle of girls, the snap of a car-door, the {{creaking}} of wheels, and then a low hum, dying away.|$|E
60|$|The clamor {{burst into}} a roar. Hawe began shaking his finger in Stewart's face and hoarsely shouting. Then a lithe young vaquero, swift as an Indian, glided under Hawe's uplifted arm. Whatever the action he intended, he {{was too late for}} its execution. Stewart lunged out, struck the vaquero, and knocked him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> As he fell a dagger glittered in the {{sunlight}} and rolled clinking over the stones. The man went down hard and did not move. With the same abrupt violence, and a manner of contempt, Stewart threw Hawe <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> then Don Carlos, who, being less supple, fell heavily. Then the mob backed before Stewart's rush until all were down in the courtyard.|$|E
50|$|Schmitz {{was the son}} of William C. and Polly Schmitz and {{was raised}} in Lafayette, Louisiana. He had several {{accidents}} as a child. As a baby his stoller rolled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of his house. As a boy he found a live bullet that he put in a toy gun. The bullet exploded and part of it lodged in his liver. As a teenager he was involved in a motor scooter accident. A head injury from the accident caused his head to swell to one and a half times itâ€™s normal size. After he recovered, his parents pushed him away from contact sports so he became interested in gymnastics.|$|R
50|$|This {{free-standing}} two-storey red {{face brick}} building {{sits on a}} rusticated Brisbane tuff base. The exterior is now painted. Though asymmetrical, the school is designed to a basilica-like plan with the narthex and nave expressed externally by steeply pitched intersecting gable roofs. The main entrance is from a five-sided apse <b>porch</b> to <b>the</b> east. To the north, a timber single-storey room with gable roof and decorative paired brackets projects {{from the middle of}} the nave. The passage between this room and the main building is now enclosed. The verandah to the south is now enclosed and a single storey brick extension has been constructed to <b>the</b> southeast corner <b>off</b> <b>the</b> apse <b>porch</b> and south verandah.|$|R
5000|$|Built in 2010 {{and opening}} {{for the first}} time in 2011, the Chaku-KÄ¥anamakwst Climbing Tower is a {{concrete}} climbing tower built just east of Discovery Lodge. The climbing tower was built of concrete to survive the harsh coastal climate and features four climbing courses of varying difficulties, an external and internal rappelling wall and future plans for a zip line on the southern side. The surrounding wall features a 360 degree bouldering course and a climbing facility used for instruction and storage of climbing gear. Previously, a smaller wooden climbing tower on the camp service road was used to teach climbing. Before that, repelling was practiced <b>off</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of <b>the</b> Big Lodge and at the [...] "Three Fingers" [...] basalt columns on Cape Lookout.|$|R
60|$|Stillwell {{took one}} mighty stride <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> His last words had been cold. His rage {{appeared}} to have been transferred to Hawe. The sheriff had begun to stutter and shake a lanky red hand at the cattleman when Stewart stepped out.|$|E
60|$|Old Belllounds leaped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> His {{gray hair}} stood {{up like the}} mane of a lion. Like a giant's were his strides. With a lunge he met his reeling son, {{swinging}} a huge fist into the sodden red face. Limply Jack fell to the ground.|$|E
60|$|His manner subtly changed then. Possibly {{it took on}} {{a little}} swagger; {{certainly}} he lost the dignity that he had shown under stress of feeling; he was now more like a cowboy about to boast or affect some stunning maneuver. Walking <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> he stood before the weary horse and burro.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it passed}} further west and was weaker than anticipated, the outerbands and {{fringe of the}} storm {{produced}} light rainfall and two tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. The first tornado in the region was spawned near Greenwood in Jackson County, but caused no damage. The other tornado touched down near Graceville in Holmes County and ripped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of a mobile home and downed numerous trees. Rainfall was reported for a 3-day period in Flagler County from August26 to August28. In Palm Coast, communities measured between [...] of precipitation. Some minor flooding occurred in parking lots. Gusty winds of [...] felled isolated trees {{in the western part}} of the county. A few trees were also blown down in Alachua County, one of which fell onto Main Street in Gainesville. Losses in Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties amounted to $10.4million and $1.2million respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The Lincoln Hotel is a {{historic}} building located in Lowden, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. [...] The Lincoln Highway was established in 1913 and passed through Lowden. This hotel was built in 1915 to accommodate the travelers that passed through town. [...] Celia Clemmens, who operated the railroad hotel in town, and her husband A.F. Clemmens built and operated this hotel as well. The hotel is a two-story, rectangular structure with an exterior covered with pebble dash stucco.The shallow-pitched hip roof, wide eaves and the stucco finish reflect {{the influence of the}} Prairie School, while the Tuscan columns on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and crown window moldings reflect the Neoclassical style. [...] <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> <b>the</b> first floor housed a small lobby, guest parlor and dining room, and the owner's living quarters. The second floor housed the twelve guest rooms and two bathrooms. A first floor addition built in 1920 to increase the size of the owner's quarters has subsequently been removed. The Lincoln Highway in Iowa became U.S. Route 30 in the 1920s, and it was realigned in the mid-1950s just to the south of Lowden. The hotel was able to stay in business until 1981. The building sat empty for the next twelve years before it was converted into apartments from 1994 to 1995.|$|R
