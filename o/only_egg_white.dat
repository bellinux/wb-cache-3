In this report, we focused on whether food proteins eaten by mother mice and secreted into breast milk as IgA-immune complexes contribute to the allergy prevention through oral tolerance in infants who ingest the milk. BALB/c mice {{were divided into two}} groups; E-group fed <b>only</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins and M-group fed only cow’s milk proteins as a dietary protein source. After immunizing M-group infants fed their own mother’s milk with ovalbumin/alum, di-arrhea associated with experimental Th 2 intestinal inflammation was induced by oral admini-stration of ovalbumin. The diarrhea was dramatically suppressed in E-group infants. Concomi-tantly, low level of serum anti-ovalbumin- and ovomucoid-IgG 1 and IgE, suppression of IL- 4 syn-thesis by spleen cells, and low incidence of anaphylactic death after intravenous injection of oval-bumin were observed preferentially in E-infants.

40|$|Background : There is a {{need for}} a {{reliable}} and accurate method for quantification of each of the seven individual vitamin B 6 compounds including pyridoxine-&#x 03 B 2;-glucoside in foods. Objective : To determine pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal 5 &#x 2032;-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine 5 &#x 2032;-phosphate (PMP), pyridoxine 5 &#x 2032;-phosphate (PNP), and pyridoxine-&#x 03 B 2;-glucoside (PNG) in foods. Design : By specific enzymatic treatment, each of the seven vitamin B 6 compounds was all converted into 4 -pyridoxolactone, which is a highly fluorescent compound. In total, seven separate, enzymatic steps were performed for each sample. Separation and quantification were performed with reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorescence detection. For each sample type the result was corrected for the recovery based on spiked samples. The method was applied for analyses of chicken liver, chicken white meat, egg yolk, egg white, dried anchovy, carrots, and garlic. Results : The recovery varied from 14 to 114 % in chicken liver, chicken white meat, egg yolk, egg white, dried anchovy, carrot, and garlic. Each food showed a characteristic distribution of the seven vitamin B 6 compounds. The PNG was only found in low amounts; that is, 17 &#x 2013; 29 &#x 2009;nmol vitamin B 6 /g in the plant-derived foods, carrot and garlic. <b>Only</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> showed a lower content, 3 &#x 2009;nmol/g. Overall the content in chicken liver, chicken white meat, and egg yolk had a total content of vitamin B 6 between 42 and 51 &#x 2009;nmol/g. Both PM and PMP were high in the chicken liver. In contrast, PL and PLP were high in the chicken white meat. The main vitamin B 6 in the egg yolk was PLP. The dried anchovy contained high amounts of PLP and PMP and a total content of 144 &#x 2009;nmol/g.

The spray drying air temperature affected the moisture of the powdered <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> without influencing the concentrations of proteins, lipids, and ash, nor the microbiological analyzes. The drying at 150 °C provided higher yield rate, but caused the darkening and the increase in the yellowness of the powdered <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> Keywords: drying; <b>egg</b> products; Maillard reaction; powered <b>egg</b> <b>white...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> is an {{important}} contributor {{to the protection of}} eggs against bacterial contaminations {{during the first half of}} incubation (day zero to 12), prior to the <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> transfer into the amniotic fluid to be orally absorbed by the embryo. This protective system relies on an arsenal of antimicrobial proteins and on intrinsic physicochemical properties that are generally unfavorable for bacterial multiplication and dissemination. Some changes in these parameters can be observed in <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> during <b>egg</b> storage and incubation. The aim of this work was to characterize changes in the antibacterial potential of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> in embryonated <b>eggs</b> (FE) during the first half of incubation using unfertilized eggs (UF) as controls. <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> samples were collected at day zero, 4, 8, and 12 and analyzed for pH, protein concentration, and protein profile. Antibacterial properties of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins were evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella Enteritidis. During incubation, differential variations of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> pH and protein concentrations were observed between UF and FE. At equal protein concentrations, similar activities against L. monocytogenes and S. uberis were observed for FE and UF <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins. A progressive decline in these activities, however, was observed over incubation time, regardless of the egg group (UF or FE). SDS-PAGE analysis of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins during incubation revealed discrete changes in the profile of major proteins, whereas the stability of some less abundant antimicrobial proteins seemed more affected. To conclude, the antibacterial activity of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins progressively decreased during the first half of egg incubation, possibly resulting from the alteration of specific antimicrobial proteins. This apparent decline may be partly counterbalanced in embryonated eggs by the increase in <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> protein concentration. The antibacterial potential of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> is very effective during early stages of embryonic development but its alteration during incubation suggests that extra-embryonic structures could then progressively ensure protective functions...|$|R
