25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung <b>over-centre</b> mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E

50|$|Shoe trees {{may also}} be made of plastic or stamped sheet metal, {{with or without a}} coiled steel spring stem; these are {{typically}} cheaper, lighter, and are better suited for travelling. Types lacking a flexing steel spring may use extension springs or adjustable two-piece stems having an <b>over-centre</b> mechanical action to wedge them in place. Plastic shoe trees maintain the shape of your shoes, but lack the moisture absorbing qualities of wooden shoe trees.|$|E
50|$|The breech {{is opened}} by the {{breechblock}} moving in-line with {{the axis of}} the barrel and is locked in the closed position by an obstruction such as a cam, wedge, paw or <b>over-centre</b> levers. A roller lock is commonly associated with firarms produced by Heckler & Koch. This type of breechblock {{can be adapted to}} cycle by lever, cocking handle or gas. The mechanism is usually designs so that a single action unlocks and then withdraws the breechblock using either a slide or levers.|$|E
50|$|Mercury relays {{have also}} been {{produced}} as latching or impulse relays. The Lenning design uses a horizontal glass tube with two axially isolated pools of mercury. A conductive stirrup can bridge these to make the connection. The relay {{is controlled by the}} stirrup being rotated {{in and out of the}} pool along the horizontal axis of the tube. A weight on the stirrup's armature gives an <b>over-centre</b> action that provides the latching behaviour. A magnetic slug on the armature allows it to be rotated and controlled by an external electromagnet.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{is used in}} digital electronics to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into 0 and 1 states. On the other hand, thermal runaway is a positive feedback that can destroy semiconductor junctions. Positive feedback in chemical reactions can increase the rate of reactions, {{and in some cases}} can lead to explosions. Positive feedback in mechanical design causes tipping-point, or <b>over-centre,</b> mechanisms to snap into position, for example in switches and locking pliers. Out of control, it can cause bridges to collapse. Positive feedback in economic systems can cause boom-then-bust cycles. A familiar example of positive {{feedback is}} the loud squealing or howling sound produced by audio feedback in public address systems: the microphone picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again.|$|E

50|$|Unattended bells are {{normally}} left {{hanging in the}} normal ("down") position but prior to being rung, the bells are rung up. In the down position, the bells are safe if a person touches them or pulls a rope. A bell that is up is dangerous to be near, and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up. The ringer pulls on the rope and starts the bell swinging. Each time the bell swings the ringer adds a little more energy to the system, similar to pushing a child's swing. Eventually there is enough energy for the bell to swing right up and be left <b>over-centre</b> just beyond the balance point with the stay resting against the slider.|$|E
5000|$|A Hampshire gate {{occupies}} a gateway in a fence {{similar to that}} used for a conventional gate. However, instead of a rigid gate, a short section of loose wire fence fits into the gap [...] - [...] this may consist of wire netting or barbed wire, and it usually matches the adjacent fence. One end of the wire is attached permanently to the main fence, and two or more short posts or battens keep it upright and flat [...] - [...] one of these is at the loose end. When the [...] "gate" [...] is closed, this end post fits into a loop of wire {{at the base of the}} fixed fence, and the top is then pulled tight to tension it. The top of the post may be held by another loop of wire, or additional tension may be provided by a length of chain looped around the post and hooked onto a nail. Proprietary closures are also available which give still greater tension, usually by means of an <b>over-centre</b> mechanism (see photo below).|$|E
40|$|Tribus b. v. is {{a company}} in Utrecht that {{converts}} minibuses for multifunctional public transportation. This means that with the same bus both ambulant people and wheelchair occupants can be transported. The multifunctionality lies in {{the combination of a}} flexible floor layout and (tip) seats. The floor system is based on separate aluminium profiles that are assembled to form any desired floor layout. Tribus' tip seat FlexusPRO meets the highest quality and safety requirements. Because of its integrated three point safety belt, the seat can be positioned anywhere in the vehicle. A common seat layout is the 4 x 4 tip seats, where four FlexusPRO seats are positioned {{on the right side of}} the vehicle and four on the left. By folding the seat pan to the backrest and subsequently rotating the seat package to the side, a wheelchair environment is created without removing or repositioning the seat. This transformation from passenger seat (mode 1) to wheelchair space (mode 2) is an easy and fast operation that enables the transporter to do a combined transportation of ambulant people and wheelchair occupants with the same vehicle. Besides the benefits of Tribus' FlexusPRO, the tip seat also has some main drawbacks with respect to the production costs, weight, the available wheelchair space after seat transformation and the hindered view outside for the wheelchair occupant as a result of the seat dimensions in mode 2. The goal is to overcome these drawbacks, in order for Tribus to be able to launch a new tip seat that exceeds seats of competitors on price, weight, operation and functionality. The goal of this graduation project focuses on the improvements of the seat position in mode 2. This means an improvement of the transformation device, where the overall goal is to reduce the production costs and weight by at least 30 % and increase the view outside for the wheelchair occupant by at least 20 % in combination with an increased lateral wheelchair space of at least 10 %. However, in order to obtain a good design, a complete concept of the new tip seat needs to be proposed, where every aspect of the seat is able to fulfil the design requirements. A morphological approach resulted in three tip seat concepts that are rated with respect to usage and manufacturing aspects. The final concept led to a tip seat with a rotation device and a tilting backrest, that increases the lateral wheelchair space in mode 2. The improvement of the lateral wheelchair space is however dependent on the entire seat design, where the base frame of the seat will be leading. Because the base frame of the seat is not part of this project, a specific percentage of the improvement is not yet known, but an improvement of at least 10 % can be realized. The separate headrest of the seat is moved down during the transformation to mode 2, which improves the view outside for the wheelchair passenger. The entire seat design is also not part of this project, but research on commercial vehicles showed that a vertical adjustment of the headrest of 210 mm is possible, which would improve the view outside by approximately 33 %. The new seat concept is used as a guideline for the design of the two mechanisms that are needed for the transformation from mode 1 to mode 2. The tilting motion of the backrest resulted in a mechanism that provides a simultaneous movement of both backrest and seat pan. The benefit is that the additional (tilting) functionality of the seat had no effect on the amount of operations needed for the transformation. The mechanism is based on the <b>over-centre</b> principle of a toggle clamp. The system uses four pivot points that connects the backrest to both seat pan and seat frame. This innovative solution resulted in the fact that no additional locking devices where necessary to prevent the angular movement of the backrest in mode 1. The loads on the three point belt in the backrest, as a result of a frontal impact, are transferred into the mechanism which is only locked by the geometry of the backrest and seat pan. This mechanism prevents additional costs and weight as a result of the additional tilting functionality. Finally a new rotation device is designed. The use of a morphological approach resulted in four concepts. The best concept is elaborated, resulting in a new steel swivel of 3 kg, which is a weight reduction of 38 %. Because of the minimal amount of components, no welding operations and an easy and fast assembly, the cost price of the swivel is reduced by 47 %. Both tilting mechanism and swivel have been prototyped and they underlined the benefits that are mentioned in this report. The swivel has even been tested by a physical pull test and passed this test successfully. The goal of reducing the production costs and weight by at least 30 % has been exceeded on both aspects. The view outside for the wheelchair occupant could be improved by 33 %, which also exceeds the required 20 %. The required improvement of the lateral wheelchair space by 10 % can still be realized and will exceed this 10 % especially around the arms of the wheelchair occupant. The project has been a success and Tribus decided to continue the development of both mechanisms for series production.
