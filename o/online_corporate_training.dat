Objects — stand-alone data elements holding “content, ” “learning,” and “knowledge ” — promise to take e-Learning {{to the next level}} of personalization and relevancy. Yet for all the buzz, learning designers and decision-makers continue to wonder how to realize those promises. Clearly, a viable learning object strategy involves much more than a shared content object resource model and metadata tags. This article {{takes a look at the}} current status of {{learning objects}}. It also explores some critical issues likely to affect the speed and degree to which the learning object model is adopted. Learning designers need to play a more visible role in the new world of learning objects.

40|$|As the {{popularity}} of eLearning continues to grow, more and more academic institutions and corporate training and development departments are developing content and delivery systems for Internet based “online” education, training and development. Oracle lab environments may call for access to specific Oracle applications, products, and tools, and the feasibility of having every user or student locally install a required lab environment is low due to constraints with licensing, technical support, local hardware and software available, {{and the level of}} expertise of the end-user. The use of thin-client technology appears to present a solution to this problem.

TITLE: PERFORMATIVE CORPORATE TRAINING IN TAIWAN MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Elyse L. Pineau	 	This dissertation attempts to translate performance concepts and techniques into <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> models for concretely increasing Taiwanese business competencies. I {{argue that this}} performance praxis is especially relevant to Taiwanese business contexts because of our Taoist traditions, which performative <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> can awaken and activate. The purpose of applying performance praxis in <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> is not to enhance physical techniques, acting skills, or technical competence, but rather to explore organizational dynamics through embodiment and to enrich management-related knowledge involving leadership, creativity, and team building. 	In Chapter One, Introduction to Taoism and Taiwanese Corporate Culture, I show that Taiwanese corporate culture is bonded and interdependent with Taoism. In Chapter Two, Performance Pedagogy for Business Contexts, I categorize different forms of performative pedagogies in teaching, learning, and <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> as well as examining Taiwanese practices of performance pedagogy. Based on my systematic literature review of Western academia and analysis of Taiwanese practices, I create a calligraphic model for developing and analyzing performative <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> programs within organizational and cultural contexts. This model elaborates three characteristics of the Taiwanese corporate culture (harmony, innovation, and teamwork), three features of Taoism (ecology, creativity, and community-building), and three principles of performance (balance, imagination, and collaboration) for Taiwanese <b>corporate</b> <b>training.</b> In Chapter Three, I present {{a case study of}} the STOMP Performative <b>Corporate</b> <b>Training</b> program, led by Smart Orange Training and Consulting. Through thick descriptions from an insider 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, I demonstrate that this innovative and successful case advances the trend of management development from experiential learning to performative training. In Chapter Four, I propose a management education course for a university Executive Master of Business Administration program, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Performing Mentor. 2 ̆ 2 In addition, I design a <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> program, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Performing Taiwanese Cultural Festivals 2 ̆ 2 that uses performative pedagogy to awaken innovation, promote harmony, and facilitate teamwork among business participants. In Chapter Five, I synthesize the study and note its limitations and directions for future research. In essence, this dissertation is theorization about performative pedagogy in <b>corporate</b> <b>training</b> with unique Taiwanese practices. It creates interdisciplinary integration, industry/academia collaboration, and cross-cultural understanding...|$|R
