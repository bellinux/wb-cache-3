These were called the [...] "standard" [...] fleet, and were fitted with pin-latched drop doors. O211-O260 {{were built in}} 1915-1916, followed by O261-O335 in 1919-1920, to accelerate delivery of coal from the Wonthaggi state mine, opened in 1909. The mine was used to overcome supply issues due to miner strikes in New South Wales. Later wagons were built to bring coal from Yallourn, which was mined to generate power at Newport for the Melbourne suburban electrified system.|$|E

The lease agreement was for 12 years with a purchase option - the agreement brought GEs for lease fleet to ~140,000 units.

50|$|Forty-four <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> were {{acquired}} during {{the takeover of}} the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company in 1878, and these were identified by the Victorian Railways as O61-O104. They were scrapped by 1889, and replaced with new vehicles recycling their numbers. The Victorian Railways also constructed <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> O105-O154 in 1886-1887 (including two O153's), followed by O155-O209 in 1889-1890. O23 was marked off register circa 1885, and a new O23 was built in 1890 to the new design. The second O153 was renumbered to O210 in 1891. With a handful of exceptions, the majority of this fleet was scrapped following the second world war. The older design was not suited for upgrading to automatic couplers.|$|R
