A soil mixture, prepared with 5 % lime content and 1 · 5 % humic acid, was stabilised with varying quantities of sodium chloride (0 · 5, 2 · 0 and 5 · 0 %).

30|$|The {{settlement}} of structures on the fine-grained soil stratums {{due to the}} vertical stress increment {{is one of the}} most important problems in geotechnical engineering. The total {{settlement of}} a structure comprises three parts: (1) immediate (elastic) compression, (2) primary consolidation, (3) secondary consolidation (creep). Elastic settlement occurs immediately due to applied load without any change in the water content. Primary consolidation is a main component of settlement of fine-grained saturated soils having low permeability, because the excess pore water pressure dissipates with time. The secondary consolidation is creep of soils such as peats and soft <b>organic</b> <b>clays</b> under constant effective stress. The primary and secondary consolidation settlements can be several times greater than the elastic settlement in saturated fine-grained soils.|$|R

40|$|The <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> soil can {{be found}} in many large size {{reclaimed}} lands. These soils present enormously high settlement potential and low strength that needs to be improved by means of effective ground improvement techniques. One of the low cost techniques is to modify the soil with lime in-situ to make it suitable for construction and allow it to increase in strength by pozzolanic reactions between lime and clay minerals. Lime is known to be an effective stabilization material for clayey soil. Nevertheless, its effectiveness may be less with <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> due to low effective strength properties. Thus, this study concerns the addition of catalyst i. e. zeolite which may improve the performance of lime stabilization to accelerate lime-organic clay reactions. The unconfined compressive test (UCT) is conducted on remoulded samples (38 mm x 80 mm) for 0, 7, 14, 28, and 90 days of curing period.

The unconfined compressive test (UCT) is conducted on 108 remolded samples (38 mm x 80 mm) for 0, 7, 14 and 28 days of curing period. The test results indicated that when NaCl or CaCl 2 is added to the lime-organic clay mixture, the strength of mixture increases with increasing salt concentration. The strength of clay stabilized with lime and sodium chloride is higher than clay stabilized with lime and calcium chloride at a 10 % salt concentration. The highest unconfined compressive strength (UCS) achieved is 777 kPa for clay stabilized with 10 % lime and 10 % NaCl cured at 28 days...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the framework of the Leendert de Boerspolder stress test. It focuses on the investigation the performance of the available constitutive models in describing the coupled hydro-mechanical response of peats and organic clays as observed during the stress test. The soil models that are considered are the Mohr-Coulomb model, the Soft Soil model and the Hardening Soil model as are implemented in PLAXIS, a standard commercial finite element code. The evaluation of the models is performed in two steps. First, the performance of the constitutive models is evaluated by simulating the laboratory tests as single soil element tests with PLAXIS SoilTest facility. Based on the comparison of the numerical results with the laboratory data it is concluded that the HS performs the best compared to the SS and the MC model. In order to achieve good fit it is found {{that it is necessary to}} drastically reduce the failure stress ratio, $Rf$ to an average value of 0. 15 in contrast to what is mentioned in literature for soft soils. In terms of one-dimensional compression stress path both the HS and SS model are deemed to perform similarly. The MC model is found to reproduce poorly the laboratory tests due to the assumption of linear elasticity - perfect plasticity. Subsequently, soil models are evaluated through a fully coupled hydro-mechanical simulation of the Leendert de Boerspolder stress test in PLAXIS 2 D. The evaluation is done through the comparison of the measured to computed displacements and pore water pressure. It is found that the prediction of the HS model is ``soft'' for peat while the stiffness degradation in the <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> results in excessive lateral displacements. Response of the SS is found to be better considering both displacements and pore water pressure. The best description of the stress test was found to be possibly by using the SS for the <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> and the HS for peat. The performance of the MC model is quantitatively good however qualitatively is deemed to be poor. Furthermore, the influence of (a) the soil anisotropy and (b) the interface between <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> and peat layers are pointed out as factors influencing the outcome of the simulation. Based on this study, it is concluded that in general the Soft Soil model, at this stage, is recommended for use for both soils. The Hardening Soil model should be used for peat but with caution and mainly when the deviatoric strains are deemed to be important. In this case the calibration should be done focusing on triaxial tests, therefore compromising the oedometric response. Moreover, a high secant stiffness should be considered to describe peat. That might be justifiable due to presence of fibers which under tensioning provide additional stiffness. Moreover, results suggest that the use of the HS model for the <b>organic</b> <b>clay</b> is not justifiable. Finally, the Mohr-Coulomb model should be used only as a rough approximation...|$|E
