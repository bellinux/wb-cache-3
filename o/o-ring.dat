5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output <b>O-ring</b> of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the <b>O-ring</b> between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the <b>O-ring</b> against the outer surface of the <b>O-ring</b> groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the <b>O-ring</b> between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the <b>O-ring,</b> is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the <b>O-ring</b> securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the <b>O-ring</b> groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the <b>O-ring</b> is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|All {{parallel}} thread valves are sealed using an <b>O-ring</b> at {{top of the}} neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve.|$|E

50|$|Viton <b>o-rings</b> are an {{alternative}} to Buna-N seals in BMW's automobile engine variable timing units, known as VANOS. In the VANOS, the Buna-N <b>o-rings</b> deteriorate. The Viton fluorocarbon <b>o-rings</b> have similar functional characteristics to Buna-N, but with much higher temperature and chemical resistance characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Metallic <b>O-rings</b> from {{indigenous}} imported {{sources were}} sent to the laboratory for a comparative study. Analysis revealed that both the imported and indigenous <b>O-rings</b> are made of 5 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel. However, there were wide variations in microstructures and hardness values in the <b>O-rings</b> from the two sources. While the imported <b>O-rings</b> were normalized and tempered to about 138 HV, the indigenous ones were annealed and tempered to about 213 HV. It appears most probable that because of higher hardness, the indigenous <b>O-rings</b> did not deform uniformly during tightening resulting in non-uniform flow of material over the contact surfaces. This has resulted in ineffective sealing leading to leakage...|$|R
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary <b>O-ring</b> not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} to cover the {{cylinder}} valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the <b>O-ring</b> of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and <b>O-ring</b> groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
50|$|The rubber {{industry}} {{has gone through}} its share of transformation after the accident. Many <b>O-rings</b> now come with batch and cure date coding, as in the medicine industry, to precisely track and control distribution. For aerospace and military/defense applications, <b>O-rings</b> are usually individually packaged and labeled with the material, cure date, and batch information. <b>O-rings</b> can, if needed, be recalled off the shelf. Furthermore, <b>O-rings</b> and other seals are routinely batch-tested for quality control by the manufacturers, and often undergo Q/A several more times by the distributor and ultimate end users.|$|R
50|$|There are two special type of pistons used in air cannons: close {{tolerance}} pistons and double pistons. In {{close tolerance}} pistons <b>O-rings</b> {{serve as a}} valve, but <b>O-rings</b> are not used in double piston types.|$|R
40|$|Two failed <b>O-rings</b> {{from the}} electro {{selector}} assembly belonging to an aircraft {{were sent to}} this laboratory for investigation. Examination showed that in both the <b>O-rings,</b> loss of material occurred by wear {{over a period of}} time. The wear pattern and the morphology of the worn out surface indicated that there was looseness in the <b>O-rings</b> which resulted in improper seating of the <b>O-rings</b> on the groove. Because of this, during motion of the piston, a sector of the rings had undesirable contact with the moving surfaces leading to accelerated wear on a sector of the rings. Analysis suggests that the failure was facilitated due to oversize of the <b>O-rings</b> and/or undersize of the groove on the piston. Evidences do not suggest any deficiencies in the material and/or deterioration in the material in service responsible for the failure...|$|R
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and <b>o-ring</b> seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
25|$|It has higher {{performance}} than non <b>O-ring</b> chain and less friction than <b>O-ring</b> chain which also increases reliability. It can last {{twice as long}} as the <b>O-ring</b> chain.|$|E
25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} {{developed}} from <b>O-ring</b> chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non <b>O-ring</b> chain. While the regular <b>O-ring</b> chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due to distortion of the <b>O-ring</b> due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing <b>O-ring</b> seal with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} rings with a square profile, {{commonly}} called square-cuts, lathe cuts, or Square rings. When <b>O-rings</b> were selling {{at a premium}} because of the novelty, lack of efficient manufacturing processes and high labor content, Square rings were introduced as an economical substitution for <b>O-rings.</b> The square ring is typically manufactured by molding an elastomer sleeve which is then lathe-cut. This style of seal is sometimes less expensive to manufacture with certain materials and molding technologies (compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding), especially in low volumes. The physical sealing performance of square rings in static applications is superior to that of <b>O-rings,</b> however in dynamic applications it is inferior to that of <b>O-rings.</b> Square rings are usually only used in dynamic applications as energizers in cap seal assemblies. Square rings can also {{be more difficult to}} install than <b>O-rings.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the dynamic characterization of rubber <b>O-rings</b> used to introduce damping in high speed gas bearing systems. O-shaped rubber rings composed of high temperature rubber compounds are characterized {{in terms of}} stiffness and damping coefficients in the frequency range 100 â€“ 800 [*]Hz. Simple formulas with frequency independent coefficients were identified to express the viscoelastic properties of the <b>O-rings.</b> The formulas proposed approximate the stiffness and damping coefficients of <b>O-rings</b> of general size...|$|R

25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an <b>O-ring</b> in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the <b>o-ring</b> between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the <b>O-ring</b> against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to <b>O-ring</b> extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E
25|$|An <b>O-ring,</b> {{also known}} as a toric joint, is a {{mechanical}} gasket {{in the shape of a}} torus containing a loop of elastomer with a disc-shaped cross-section. It is designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, creating a seal at the interface. The <b>O-ring</b> was invented in 1937 by Danish-American machinist Niels Christensen.|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>O-ring</b> chain it has {{sealing rings}} which keep the {{contaminant}} (dirt) out, and lubricant {{in between the}} pins and bushings. However, unlike <b>O-ring</b> chain, it has X shaped seal which does not increase surface area (which is {{in contact with the}} chain plates) when under pressure. Therefore the friction in X-ring chain does not increase much when pressure is applied by the chain plates.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} plug (or no-flare plug) is a typical-looking cylinder, without flares, and {{is kept in}} place by sliding <b>o-rings</b> against {{both ends of the}} plug. A grooved plug is a variation on the {{straight plug}}, with grooves carved in the material to hold the <b>o-rings</b> snug.|$|R

25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} a {{specialized}} type of sealed roller chain used to transfer mechanical power. Like the <b>O-ring</b> chain {{it is used}} in high performance motorcycles. It uses X-ring seal to keep lubricant(usually grease) in place.|$|E
25|$|Running out of {{breathing}} gas most commonly happens {{as a result}} of poor gas management. It can also happen due to unforeseen exertion or breathing equipment failure. Equipment failure resulting in the loss of all gas could be caused by failure of a pressure retaining component such as an <b>O-ring</b> or hose in the regulator or, in cold conditions, a freezing of water in the regulator resulting in a free flow from the demand valve.|$|E
25|$|The thumb lug on the Umnumzaan is {{used for}} opening the knife blade, as well as serving as the stop pin that {{contacts}} the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane <b>o-ring</b> {{that acts as a}} shock absorber to cushion the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{teleconference}} on {{the evening}} of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and Roger Boisjoly) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber <b>O-rings</b> that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement. They argued {{that they did not have}} enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the <b>O-rings</b> were colder than 12 C. This was an important consideration, since the SRB <b>O-rings</b> had been designated as a [...] "Criticality 1" [...] component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary <b>O-rings</b> failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.|$|R
40|$|Contamination of {{spacecraft}} components with planetary {{and foreign}} object debris is a growing concern. Face seals separating the spacecraft cabin from the debris filled environment are particularly susceptible; if the seal becomes contaminated there is potential for decreased performance, mission failure, or catastrophe. In this study, silicone elastomer <b>O-rings</b> were contaminated with JSC- 1 A lunar regolith and their leak rate performance was evaluated. The leak rate values of contaminated <b>O-rings</b> at four levels of seal compression were compared to those of as-received, uncontaminated, <b>O-rings.</b> The results showed a drastic increase in leak rate after contamination. JSC- 1 A contaminated <b>O-rings</b> lead to immeasurably high leak rate values for all levels of compression except complete closure. Additionally, a mechanical method of simulant removal was examined. In general, this method returned the leak rate to as-received values...|$|R
5000|$|While {{participating}} in {{the investigation into the}} destruction of Challenger during STS-51-L in 1986, Overmyer discovered that a problem with the shuttle's <b>O-rings,</b> similar to that which led to the disaster, had emerged during the launch of STS-51-B. Morton Thiokol engineers told Lind after the mission that [...] "you came within three-tenths of one second of dying." [...] It was the problem with the <b>O-rings</b> on the left solid rocket motor on this launch (SRM 16A) that prompted Roger Boisjoly to write his famous memo to Bob Lund about the potential for the <b>O-rings</b> to cause catastrophic failure. (See [...] ) ...|$|R
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to blowing the <b>O-ring</b> seal if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E
25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates {{in the shape of a}} butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an <b>O-ring</b> in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E
