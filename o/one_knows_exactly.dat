25|$|Leroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a {{photograph}} from the International Space Station {{that shows the}} wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the China Daily later reported that the Great Wall {{can be seen from}} 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where to look. However, the resolution of a camera can be much higher than the human visual system, and the optics much better, rendering photographic evidence irrelevant to the issue of whether it is visible to the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|For this reason, {{many from}} this {{municipality}} {{and others from}} the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each family here. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how many {{from the state of}} Querétaro have gone to the U.S. to work or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar {{has become part of the}} economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season.|$|E
2500|$|The Smithsonian American Art Museum {{notes that}} [...] "neither early success nor gracious spirit spared Delaney from the obscurity and poverty" [...] that plagued {{most of his}} adult life. Brooks Atkinson wrote in his 1951 book Once Around the Sun: [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how Beauford lives. Pegging away at a style of {{painting}} that few people understand or appreciate, he has disciplined himself, not only physically but spiritually, to live with a kind of personal magnetism in a barren world." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh capitally," [...] said Mr Egerton. [...] "He {{has very}} seldom spoken before and always {{slightly}} though well. He was listened to with mute attention; {{never was a}} better house. I should say made a great impression, though no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what he was after." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Manassé Nzobonimpa {{made public}} {{declarations}} accusing {{a group of}} officials in the ruling CNDD FDD of corruption, killings and other human rights violations. He then fled into exile though no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> which country received him. Manasse criticized president Nkurunziza's search for a third term.|$|R
2500|$|Two of Clio's sisters, Melpomene (the oldest sister) and Calliope, are jealous that Clio ({{although}} the youngest) is {{the leader}} of the Muses and that Zeus had promised [...] "Xanadu" [...] to Clio, although no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what that entails ("Evil Woman"). So they plot to discredit Clio and cause her banishment by tricking her into breaking one of Zeus's rules: a Muse must not fall in love with a mortal, so they will curse [...] "Kira" [...] and Sonny to fall in love.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{notes that}} Bell was [...] "both more lively and more honest" [...] than {{political}} statements in his time. He quotes six examples of her writing, the shortest {{of which is}} [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what they do want, least of all themselves, except that they don’t want us." [...] He quotes Bell's colleague, T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), as saying that she was [...] "not a good judge of men or situations", and observes that [...] "If there was no ideal solution, however, there were still clear mistakes. Bell should never have acquiesced in {{the inclusion of the}} Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul in Iraq." [...] However, Stewart praises her 1920 White Paper, comparing it to General Petraeus's report to the US Congress.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 28 June 1940, a terror bombing {{rationale}} had been advanced for the A4 (V-2 rocket) being developed {{at a meeting}} between Army Ordnance Chief Emil Leeb and Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, Walther von Brauchitsch. Following the relative failure of the Baedeker Raids on Britain in 1942, development of both flying bomb and rocket accelerated, with Britain designated as the target. On September 29, 1943, Albert Speer publicly promised retribution against the mass bombing of German cities by a [...] "secret weapon". Then the official 24 June 1944 Reich Propaganda Ministry announcement of the [...] "Vergeltungswaffe 1" [...] guided missile implied there would be another such weapon. After the first operational A-4 launch in September 1944, the rocket was renamed the V-2. (although no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> who gave it this name). However, the V-2 operations manual distributed to firing batteries continued to use the A-4 name for the rocket.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unproven}} imputations {{put forward}} in the book Spycatcher, in which Hastings was portrayed as participating {{in an attempt to}} destabilise the Harold Wilson government were always vehemently denied by him. The book's author, Peter Wright, was regularly denounced by Hastings as [...] "that traitor", though no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> to what betrayal he was referring.|$|R
60|$|In front {{the battle}} {{had broken out}} again, as furiously as ever; and ere long wounded men began to come down again. They brought cheering news, however. The Prussians were still {{pressing}} forward, the cavalry had thrown the Austrian line into terrible confusion. No <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where any of the Prussian battalions had got to, but all agreed that things were going on well.|$|R
6000|$|Vida was an {{advocate}} of culture-buying and efficiency-systems. She hinted {{that they ought to}} have (as at the committee-meetings of the Thanatopsis) a [...] "regular order of business," [...] and [...] "the reading of the minutes," [...] but as there were no minutes to read, and as no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what was the regular order of the business of being literary, they had to give up efficiency.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] remarked Mr. Merrick, thoughtfully, [...] "that no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what the}} blamed hill may do next. I don't {{like to take}} chances with three girls on my hands. They are a {{valuable}} lot, Colonel, and worth saving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, uncle," [...] said Alf, who was by {{no means}} as {{reckless}} as his brother, [...] "don't you think it's rather risky to go off into an unknown sea in open boats, for no one knows how long, to go no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say that}} there are about twenty-five {{thousand}} of them, but no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly.</b> Natives get through pretty often from Ladysmith, but they know no more there than we do here. They are all jolly and cheerful there, in the thought that they will soon be relieved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} great changes here. A year ago, almost {{everyone}} thought that the Assembly {{was going to do}} wonderful things. No <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what. According to what they said, everyone was to be able to eat meat, seven days a week, to wear good clothes, and to do just as much work as pleased him and no more. Even the fishermen and sailors were fools enough to believe it.|$|R
50|$|By early morning, the Axis forces {{launched}} {{a series of}} attacks using 15th Panzer and Littorio divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set, the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting {{in the loss of}} over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces.|$|R
2500|$|Defensive log blockhouses built {{alongside}} the road had portholes {{in the walls}} for firing at Native American attackers. They were often called [...] "stations". [...] No <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> when the next attack would happen. The Shawnee came from the north, while the Chickamauga (Cherokees who rejected the land sale treaty) came from the south. The tribes were resentful of the settlers taking their ancestral hunting lands, and the French and Indian War had further stirred up their passions against the white man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Prescott's death. He came to Abercrombie Place one night, {{and stayed}} very late. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> when he left, but {{about one in}} the morning a fellow who knew him met him walking rapidly in the {{direction}} of the Queen's Park. He bade him good night, but Prescott hurried on without heeding him, and that was the last time he was ever seen alive. Three days afterwards his body was found floating in St. Margaret's Loch, under St. Anthony's Chapel. No one could ever understand it, but of course the verdict brought it in as temporary insanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man of whom you, I suppose, never heard," [...] Kinsley replied. [...] "His name is Fentolin--Miles Fentolin--and {{he lives}} somewhere down in Norfolk. He {{is one of}} the strangest {{characters}} that ever lived, stranger than any effort of fiction I ever met with. He was in the Foreign Office once, and every one was predicting for him a brilliant career. Then there was an accident--let me see, it must have been some six or seven years ago--and he had to have both his legs amputated. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how the accident happened, and there was always a certain amount of mystery connected with it. Since then he has buried himself in the country. I don't think, in fact, that he ever moves outside his place; but somehow or other he has managed {{to keep in touch with}} all the political movements of the day." ...|$|E
60|$|The bars {{along the}} coast shift with every storm, and in many places there is {{occasionally}} none at all. We ourselves observed {{the effect of a}} single storm with a high tide in the night, in July, 1855. It moved the sand on the beach opposite the light-house to the depth of six feet, and three rods in width as far as we could see north and south, and carried it bodily off no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where, laying bare in one place a large rock five feet high which was invisible before, and narrowing the beach to that extent. There is usually, as I have said, no bathing on the back-side of the Cape, on account of the undertow, but when we were there last, the sea had, three months before, cast up a bar near this lighthouse, two miles long and ten rods wide, over which the tide did not flow, leaving a narrow cove, then {{a quarter of a mile}} long, between it and the shore, which afforded excellent bathing. This cove had from time to time been closed up as the bar travelled northward, in one instance imprisoning four or five hundred whiting and cod, which died there, and the water as often turned fresh, and finally gave place to sand. This bar, the inhabitants assured us, might be wholly removed, and the water six feet deep there in two or three days.|$|E

50|$|A candle auction is a {{variation}} {{in which the}} end of the auction is signaled by the expiration of a candle flame. This was intended to ensure that no <b>one</b> could <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> when the auction would end and make a last-second bid.|$|R
50|$|Ichirō Mamiya (Mamiya Ichirō) - A famous {{artist who}} {{disappeared}} 30 {{years ago in}} his mansion. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> what <b>exactly</b> happened to him, but his death is likely connected to the suicide of his beloved wife.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawback}} of {{open-loop control}} {{is that it}} requires perfect knowledge of the system (i.e. <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what inputs to give {{in order to get}} the desired output), and it assumes there are no disturbances to the system.|$|E
50|$|He {{anticipated}} certain {{doctrines of}} Adam Smith and Thomas Robert Malthus, especially the latter, {{as he felt}} that the population propagation, if it were allowed free rein, would take place in a geometric progression with a doubling every 30 years. No <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how he died.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the NAIRU theory is that no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what the NAIRU is (while it clearly changes over time). The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, {{making it hard to}} use the NAIRU in policy-making.|$|E
30|$|All {{kinds of}} {{notation}} {{have their own}} advantages and drawbacks.

60|$|All but the troops. The {{remaining}} troops {{stayed behind}} {{as best they}} could, a few thousand here, a platoon there. No <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where they were; they stayed where they could, moving around at night, hiding in ruins, in sewers, cellars, with the rats and snakes. It {{looked as if the}} Soviet Union had the war almost won. Except for a handful of projectiles fired off from the moon daily, there was almost no weapon in use against them. They came and went as they pleased. The war, for all practical purposes, was over. Nothing effective opposed them.|$|R
60|$|Great was {{the commotion}} {{in the little}} town of Bristol at the return of all the Woolstons, who had gone off, no <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> whither; some saying to New Holland; others to China; and a few even to Japan. The {{excitement}} extended across the river to the little city of Burlington, and there was danger of the whole history of the colony's getting into the newspapers. The colonists, however, were still discreet, and in a week something else occurred to draw the attention of the multitude, and the unexpected visit was soon regarded like any other visit.|$|R
50|$|While no <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how far Pytheas sailed, he {{may have}} crossed the Arctic Circle. Nevertheless, his tales were {{regarded}} as fantasy by later Greek and Roman authorities, such as the geographer Strabo.
