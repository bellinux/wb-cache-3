40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{corporations}} and the monetary system on which they <b>operate,</b> <b>conducted</b> {{through the lens of}} media ecology. By treating corporations and currencies as media, we become capable of parsing the environments they create, as well as evaluating their biases and openness to broad participation. Our analysis reveals how corporatism became naturalized and accepted as the pre-existing condition of the social and business environment. To trace this process, we explore the legal and fiscal landscape as a media environment subject to the intervention of those with power to directly change the rules by which government and other players interact. We also uncover the way communications media were utilized both intentionally and in passive reaction to the changing landscape in order to perpetuate a worldview in which these interventions came to be perceived as natural phenomena or part of the human condition. Finally, we consider the advent of interactive technology as a potential game-changer, capable of opening access to both the rules through which the corporatist monopoly is maintained as well as the ways in which it is perceived...|$|R

Recent and potential future budget cuts give fuel conservation and efficiency extreme importance. The policies and practices explored incur no overhead cost, and {{to reap the benefits}} of these changes, we simply need to prudently change in the way we <b>operate.</b> <b>Conducting</b> drift operations 10 % of the nights while underway can save the Navy $ 14. 1 million per year, and conducting single-generator operations 25 % of the time underway can save $ 27. 4 million per year. Removing the moving window requirement during a transit can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 21 %. Utilizing the Transit Fuel Planner shows fuel savings as high as 19 % during transits. Lowering the minimum fuel safety levels in 5 th and 7 th Fleets from 60 % to 50 % reduces fuel consumption for Military Sealift Command ships by $ 18. 5 million per year. Changing or removing outdated policies and practices utilized by the surface fleet can save significant amounts of fuel, and therefore dollars, and can be done with the stroke of a pen.
