50|$|As {{described}} above, dispersed heterojunctions of donor-acceptor {{organic materials}} have high quantum efficiencies {{compared to the}} planar hetero-junction, because in dispersed heterojunctions {{it is more likely}} for an exciton to find an interface within its diffusion length. Film morphology can also have a drastic effect on the quantum efficiency of the device. Rough surfaces and the presence of voids can increase the series resistance and also the chance of short-circuiting. Film morphology and, as a result, quantum efficiency can be improved by annealing of a device after covering it by a ~1000 Å thick metal cathode. Metal film on top of the <b>organic</b> <b>film</b> applies stresses on the <b>organic</b> <b>film,</b> which helps to prevent the morphological relaxation in the <b>organic</b> <b>film.</b> This gives more densely packed films {{and at the same time}} allows the formation of phase-separated interpenetrating donor-acceptor interface inside the bulk of organic thin film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{metallization}} of <b>organic</b> thin <b>films</b> is {{a crucial}} point {{in the development of}} organic electronic devices. There is no method established yet to detect trace amounts of metal atoms in the <b>organic</b> thin <b>films</b> after metal deposition. Radiotracer measurements are probably the most sensitive tool to study diffusion and to quantify even very small amounts of material penetrating into the bulk. So far, this has been shown for metals and polymers, but not for thin ordered molecular <b>organic</b> <b>films.</b> Here, the first application of this technique on a well-characterized <b>organic</b> thin <b>film</b> system, diindenoperylene using thermally evaporated Ag containing 110 mAg radiotracers is shown. The results show that Ag is mainly adsorbed on the surface, but indicate that already at moderate substrate temperatures small concentrations of Ag can penetrate into the <b>organic</b> thin <b>films</b> and agglomerate at the interface during metallization...|$|R

5000|$|With the {{exception}} of phosphatic preservation, individual cells are never preserved; only structures such as chitinous exoskeleton, or scales and jaws, survive. This poses little problem for most invertebrate groups, whose outline is defined by a resistant exoskeleton.Pyrite and phosphate are exceptional additions to Burgess Shale type preservation, and are certainly not found in all localities. The defining preservation process is that which preserves <b>organic</b> <b>film</b> plus phyllosilicate. For this preservation to occur, the organisms must be protected from decay. There are a few ways that this can happen; for instance they can be chemically protected within the sediment by phyllosilicates or biopolymers, which inhibit the action of decay related enzymes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the wake}} of the {{increasing}} importance of organic electronics, a more in-depth understanding of the early stages of <b>organic</b> <b>film</b> growth is indispensable.

The focus is particularly put on the application of thermal desorption spectroscopy to shed light on the kinetics and energetics of the molecule–substrate interaction. While each adsorption system reveals a manifold of features that are specific for the individual system, one can draw some general statements on the early stages of <b>organic</b> <b>film</b> formation from the available datasets.
