40|$|We {{define the}} $p^m$-curvature map on the sheaf of {{differential}} <b>operators</b> of <b>level</b> $m$ on a scheme of positive characteristic $p$ as dual to some divided power map on infinitesimal neighborhhods. This {{leads to the}} notion of $p^m$-curvature on differential modules of level $m$. We use this construction to recover Kaneda's description of a semi-linear Azumaya splitting of the sheaf of differential <b>operators</b> of <b>level</b> $m$. Then, using a lifting modulo $p^ 2 $ of Frobenius, we are able to define a Frobenius map on differential <b>operators</b> of <b>level</b> $m$ as dual to some divided Frobenius on infinitesimal neighborhhods. We use this map to build a true Azumaya splitting of the completed sheaf of differential <b>operators</b> of <b>level</b> $m$ (up to an automorphism of the center). From this, we derive the fact that Frobenius pull back gives, when restricted to quasi-nilpotent objects, an equivalence between Higgs-modules and differential modules of level $m$. We end by explaining the relation with related work of Ogus-Vologodski and van der Put in level zero as well as Berthelot's Frobenius descent...|$|R

During this phase crewmembers as well as backup crews will train together. The crew tasks on the ISS are individually tailored, with consideration to the astronaut's particular experience and professional background. There are three different user levels for all on-board equipment (i.e. user level, <b>operator</b> <b>level,</b> and specialist level). A crew member can be a specialist on systems while also only being an operator or user on others, hence why the training program is individually tailored. Increment Specific Training also includes training to deal with off-nominal situations. Astronauts will also learn how to run the experiments that are specifically scheduled for their assigned missions.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the early}} 1960s through the mid-1970s, Levi Strauss {{experienced}} significant growth in its business {{as the more}} casual look of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in the [...] "blue jeans craze" [...] {{and served as a}} catalyst for the brand. Levi's, under the leadership of Walter Haas, Peter Haas Sr., Paul Glasco and George P. Simpkins Sr., expanded the firm's clothing line by adding new fashions and models, including stone-washed jeans through the acquisition of Great Western Garment Co. (GWG), a Canadian clothing manufacturer acquired by Levi's. The acquisition led to the introduction of the modern [...] "stone washing" [...] technique, still in use by Levi Strauss. Simpkins is credited with the company's record-paced expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 16 plants to more than 63 plants in the United States from 1964 to 1974 and 23 overseas. Levi's' expansion under Simpkins was accomplished without a single unionized employee as a result of Levi's' and the Haas family's strong stance on human rights and Simpkins' use of [...] "pay for performance" [...] manufacturing from the sewing machine <b>operator</b> <b>level</b> up. As a result, Levi's' plants were perhaps the highest performing, best organized and cleanest textile facilities of their time.|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{proof of}} factorization theorem for Drell-Yan process that works at <b>operator</b> <b>level</b> {{is given in}} the article. Final state interactions for such inclusive processes are proved to be cancel out at <b>operator</b> <b>level</b> according to the unitarity of time evolution operator. After this cancellation, one can always deform the integral path so that eikonal line approximation works while calculating the time evolution of electromagnetic currants. Decoupling of soft gluons from collinear jets is realized by defining new collinear fields that decouple from soft gluons. Cancelation of soft gluons is attribute to unitarity of time evolution operator and light-like Wilson lines of soft gluons. Comment: 12 page...|$|E

An abstract action, constructed on the <b>operator</b> <b>level,</b> that yields this equation as equation of motion is also derived. To relate this formalism to current formulations of non-commutative quantum field theories, this action is written in a coherent state basis, leading to an action in 4 -dimensional Minkowski space-time. The resulting action differs from existing non-commutative actions, but still exhibits non-commutative effects through non-locality...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that in human-robot interaction, the {{effectiveness}} of a robot varies inversely with the operator engagement in the task. Given the importance of maintaining optimal task engagement when working with a robot, it would be immensely useful to have a robotic system that can detect the <b>level</b> of <b>operator</b> engagement and modify its behavior if required.

The results from affect- elicitation tasks for human participants showed that it was possible to detect engagement through physiological sensing in real-time.
