The availability of local <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> {{is an important factor in}} the development of this plant. Therefore, we investigate the availability of local <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> for the Vattenfall biomass plant. Also, we investigate the factors that determine this availability. We estimated the available volume of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> for the Vattenfall biomass plant to be around 1130 ktonodt per annum. This is a significant smaller volume than the volume estimated in currently existing potential studies, We are able to explain this difference by several factors. Important factors are the lack of clear-fellings in Dutch forests, other functions for forests than wood production, relatively high logistical costs to collect <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> from orchards and road sides and the existence of competing industries. Four potential options to increase the actual availability of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> are the reduction of logistical costs via umbrella organizations, a change in the willingness of supply of nature conservation organizations, the combustion of grass and the import of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass.</b> ...|$|R

In this study we estimated the carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration in a Short Rotation Forestry of poplar located in the basin of Ticino River, Lombardy, Italy (45 ° 19 ' 00 " N 008 ° 51 ' 00 " E). The SRF plantation (P generosa X P. nigra clone Pegaso) occupies an area of 80 ha: trees were planted in March 2004 using 1 -year-old seedlings in a double row design with a spacing of 2. 8 x 0. 75 x 0. 45 m corresponding to a density of 12. 500 plants ha- 1. We used two independent techniques: eddy correlation (EC) provide measurements of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) based on the fluxes generated by the photosynthetic and respiration activity, and a traditional approach, based on biomass increment, for estimate the CO 2 gain by the vegetation. The heterotrophic respiration of the soil was measure using trench technique in order to quantify the amount of carbon losses by microbial activity. The two approaches allow to determine the Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) of the ecosystem that represent the net amount of CO 2 gained by the ecosystem. Obtained data was used to estimate the differences between the two techniques proposed.

40|$|From energy outlooks, {{it becomes}} clear that global {{bioenergy}} consumption is expected to grow further; specifically the demand for wood for electricity and heating, together with agricultural biomass for liquid biofuels. The EU has an ambitious and integrated policy in order to address climate change and security of energy supply towards 2020. Proposed policies with more stringent goals for the 2030 horizon are: 40 % greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction, and further increase of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Further mobilisation of wood within the EU- 28 and supplementary supplies from North American and Russian forests could help to fulfil EU’s 2020 - 2030 policies. Specifically for external supplies, the import of wood pellets from outside the EU is expected to significantly contribute to EU’s future demand. Based on existing knowledge gaps and the reach of EU’s policies, three research questions are addressed: How can the supply of wood pellets and <b>other</b> <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> be guaranteed in a sustainable way, following the EU legislation on legal sourcing, sustainable biomass production and efficient re-use of wood wastes (cascading) ?Worldwide, a large share of the managed (production) forest area is currently not certified. A risk based approach is used by suppliers to comply with legal sourcing requirements, together with forest certification. This approach may lead to insufficient coverage of sustainability criteria. Obviously, a maximum ceiling for risk based fibers is needed, also to encourage the use of fibers from certified forests. Although technically possible, waste wood is not yet mixed with forest fibers for wood pellet production. Trade seems restricted due to unclear rules in the EU Waste Directive. What are the current and future woody biomass demand & supply market expectations due to-EU’s future policies? Future demand and supply of woody biomass need more attention. Wood shortages are expected from 2020 and beyond, based on current forest management and consumption patterns for virgin wood fibres and recycled wood. Future efforts on wood mobilisation should focus on the introduction of state-of-the-art Scandinavian style forest management methods in other EU Member states and the support for recycling of post-consumer wood waste fibres. What is the GHG emission reduction potential of using woody biomass for power and heat (by replacing fossil fuels) in comparison with using harvested wood products for traditional wood and paper products (e. g. construction wood instead of steel and concrete) ? Based on EU’s future growth in woody biomass needs for energy (77 million tonnes per annum) and elaborated harvested wood product (HWP) scenarios, total annual GHG savings in the EU by producing wood pellets to replace coal may amount in 105 million tonnes CO 2 eq, which is 9. 4 % of the EU’s absolute reduction goal in 2020. In an optimum savings scenario, harvested wood from high quality trees should be first used for sawn wood, followed by recycling and combustion (cascading), whereas low quality logs can be immediately used for pellets and energy. These extra GHG savings for product cascading before energy use amount to at least 5 million tonnes CO 2 eq (0. 4 % of EU’s goal) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The federal government is placing greater emphasis on thinning vegetation on public lands {{to reduce the risk}} of wildland fire. To help defray the cost of thinning efforts, it also is seeking to stimulate a market for the resulting material, including the smaller trees, limbs, and brush [...] referred to as <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> [...] that traditionally have had little or no commercial value. As GAO has reported in the past, the increased use of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> faces obstacles, including the high cost of harvesting and transporting it and an unpredictable supply in some locations. Nevertheless, some entities, such as schools and businesses, are utilizing the material, potentially offering insights for broadening its use. GAO agreed to (1) identify key factors facilitating the use of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> among selected users, (2) identify challenges these users have faced in using <b>woody</b> <b>biomass,</b> and (3) discuss any insights that these findings may offer for promoting greater use of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass.</b> In responding to a draft of this report, the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and the Interior all generally agreed with GAO's findings. ...|$|R
30|$|Many {{studies have}} been done in {{association}} with the environmental impact of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> utilization, such as contribution to reducing GHG emissions by Hitoe and Hattori [1], Kayo et al. [2], and Akita et al. [3]. There are also studies focused on the feasibility assessment of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> as useful energy products by Yamaguchi et al. [4], Terada et al. [5], Uragami et al. [6], Futawatari et al. [7], and Lyudmyla et al. [8]. In addition, approach to assess the regional economic impacts is one of the important goals to promote <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> utilization. Gan and Smith [9] indicated that energy from forest biomass is generally not cost-competitive with fossil fuels under current technology and market conditions in the US through their comparative analysis of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> and coal. Though doubt remains about how effective <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> is compared to fossil fuel as a source of energy, Hall [10], Gan and Smith [11], and Ikegami and Niitsuma [12] suggested that the production of forest biomass and bio-energy will also produce a variety of co-benefits such as developing renewable energy, and employment creation, in regional terms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the global energy production potential of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> from forestry for the year 2050 using a bottom-up analysis of key factors. <b>Woody</b> <b>biomass</b> from forestry was defined as all of the aboveground <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> of trees, including all products made from <b>woody</b> <b>biomass.</b> This includes the harvesting, processing and use of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass.</b> The projection was performed by comparing the future demand with the future supply of wood, based on existing databases, scenarios, and outlook studies. Specific attention was paid to the impact of the underlying factors that determine this potential and to the gaps and uncertainties in our current knowledge. Key variables included the demand for industrial roundwood and woodfuel, the plantation establishment rates, and the various theoretical, technical, economical, and ecological limitations related to the supply of wood from forests. Forests, as defined in this study, exclude forest plantations. Key uncertainties were the supply of wood from trees outside forests, the future rates of deforestation, the consumption of woodfuel, and the theoretical, technical, economical, or ecological wood production potentials of the forests. Based on a medium demand and medium plantation scenario, the global theoretica...|$|R
40|$|In Montana, USA, {{there are}} {{substantial}} opportunities for mechanized thinning treatments on public forests {{to reduce the}} likelihood of severe and damaging wildfires and improve forest health. These treatments produce residues {{that can be used to}} generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. The choice modeling method is employed to examine the marginal willingness of Montanans' to pay (MWTP) for <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> energy produced from treatments in their public forests. The survey instrument elicited social preferences for important co-benefits and costs of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> energy generation in Montana, namely the extent of healthy forests, the number of large wildfires, and local air quality. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> energy generation, forest health and air quality. MWTP to avoid large wildfires is statistically insignificant. However, MWTP for <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> energy diminishes quickly, revealing that Montanans do not support public forestland management that produces more than double the current level of <b>woody</b> <b>biomass</b> harvested for energy generation. These findings can be used by policy makers and public land managers to estimate the social benefits of utilizing residues from public forest restoration or fuel treatment programs to generate energy...|$|R
