5|$|Despite {{his early}} success, sales later {{declined}} and Muntz's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, {{and although he}} tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and {{went out of business}} in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but without its namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz's success continued in the sales <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> general consumer electronics.|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (s-HPT) in uremia {{is characterized}} by decreased expression in the parathyroids <b>of</b> calcium sensing (<b>CaR)</b> <b>and</b> vitamin D receptors (VDR). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normalized despite low levels <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> <b>and</b> VDR after experimental reversal of uremia. The expression <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> in parathyroid cultures decreases rapidly. Methylation of promoter regions is often detected during epigenetic downregulation of gene expression. Therefore, using an experimental rat model, we examined changes in methylation levels <b>of</b> parathyroid <b>CaR</b> <b>and</b> VDR promoters in vivo and in vitro. Methods. Uremia was induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy. Melting temperature profiling <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> <b>and</b> VDR PCR products after bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA from rat parathyroids was performed. Real-time PCR measured expression <b>of</b> PTH, <b>CaR,</b> VDR, <b>and</b> klotho genes in vitro. Results. Parathyroids from uremic rats had similar low levels of methylation in vivo and in vitro. In culture, a significant downregulation <b>of</b> <b>CaR,</b> VDR, <b>and</b> klotho within two hours of incubation was observed, while housekeeping genes remained stable for 24 hours. Conclusion. In uremic s-HPT and in vitro, no overall changes in methylation levels in the promoter regions <b>of</b> parathyroid <b>CaR</b> <b>and</b> VDR genes were found. Thus, epigenetic methylation of these promoters does not explain decreased parathyroid expression <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> <b>and</b> VDR genes in uremic s-HPT...|$|R

He moved into single seaters, winning the US and Canadian Formula Atlantic championships in 1976, before being offered a drive in Formula One with the McLaren team at the 1977 British Grand Prix. He was taken on by reigning world champions Ferrari {{for the end of}} the season and from 1978 to his death in 1982 drove for the Italian team. He won six Grand Prix races in a short career at the highest level. In 1979, he finished second by four points in the championship to teammate Jody Scheckter.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit as people in the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings <b>of</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Lewis and Falsone {{investigate}} the execution-style shootings of Wilkie Collins and his wife, presumably {{in retaliation for}} Collins cooperating with police in the investigation and incarceration of Georgia Rae Mahoney, Luther's sister. They find Collins' young son Jack (Marc John Jefferies) hiding in a closet at the house, but he is too terrified to answer any of their questions. Falsone takes the Jack to a park, where they bond over their mutual love <b>of</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> Falsone teaches him how to hotwire a vehicle. More comfortable with the police, Jack tells Falsone that a man identifying himself as Robert on Collins' answering machine has the same voice as the killer. A disturbed Stivers recognizes the voice as belonging to Detective Robert Castleman (Lance Lewman). After Jack identifies Castleman in a lineup, Lewis and Falsone confront him with the evidence during questioning, pressuring Castleman to confess to the murder. Castleman said Georgia Rae Mahoney blackmailed him into killing Collins by threatening to reveal Castleman had been on Luther Mahoney's payroll.|$|E
