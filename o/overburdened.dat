5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an <b>overburdened</b> drive train {{originally}} intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure.

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to fragment the <b>overburden</b> {{by use of}} explosives. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the <b>overburden,</b> filling the holes with explosives, and detonating the explosive. The <b>overburden</b> is then removed, using large earth-moving equipment, such as draglines, shovel and trucks, excavator and trucks, or bucket-wheels and conveyors.

30|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of pore pressure from wireline logs requires prior {{calculation of the}} <b>overburden</b> pressure. <b>Overburden</b> pressure is the pressure exerted {{by the weight of}} all the overlying sediments. The decrease in sediment porosity under the effect of burial (compaction) is proportional to the increase in <b>overburden</b> pressure. <b>Overburden</b> pressure gradient in psi/ft is a function of formation density (ρ) in g/cc ×  0.434. Formation density varies with depth, so <b>overburden</b> pressure is a variable function of depth.|$|R
5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already <b>overburdened</b> German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already <b>overburdened</b> with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|While {{long-term}} {{psychological and}} neurological studies {{have yet to}} yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, {{a few studies have}} provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly <b>overburdened</b> the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As for shallow tunnels {{through the}} rock layers, the {{stability}} of the <b>overburden</b> rock has a decisive role on the tunnel stability; furthermore, analyzing {{the stability of}} the <b>overburden</b> rock is very important to the supporting design and the choice of excavation method. Method of elastic foundation beam is used to research the moment of <b>overburden</b> rock, and the formula of <b>overburden</b> rock stable thickness is finished. Seven sections of JIAOZHOU Bay Subsea Tunnel are took for example to analyze the safety factor of different span and <b>overburden</b> rock thickness, then the stability of <b>overburden</b> rock is analyzed. The results show that the <b>overburden</b> rock safety factors of these seven sections of JIAOZHOU Bay Subsea Tunnel are range from 0. 65 to 0. 85. Compared with the experimental results, theoretical analysis of the results are more consistent The actual example verifies that the <b>overburden</b> rock stability in this paper is feasible...|$|R

30|$|The {{study of}} Allichi (2007) which {{involved}} characterization of weathered <b>overburden</b> revealed estimated <b>overburden</b> thickness using geoelectrical VES surveys {{to be from}} 3.8 to 50  m with mean value of about 20  m as dictated by bedrock types. These values are {{within the range of}} values obtained for similar Basement Complex terrains of Africa. Furthermore, it was observed that areas with thin/shallow <b>overburden</b> coincided mostly with areas underlain by variably migmatized gneiss complex, while area with thicker <b>overburden</b> unit coincided with area mainly underlain by schist. However, quartzite/quartz-schist setting coincided with areas of moderate to shallow <b>overburden</b> thickness.|$|R
5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat <b>overburdened</b> with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found {{administrative tasks}} to be mundane.

The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be <b>overburdened</b> with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E
5|$|Now {{functioning}} as a freeway, the QEW was already <b>overburdened</b> by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, the lone four-lane link on the route between Hamilton and Toronto, was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Preliminary work on a second parallel structure began a decade later in 1983. In July of that year, Transportation Minister James Snow broke ground for the new bridge. Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October11, 1985. It was named the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of James Allan, Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years. It reopened on August22, 1988, with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is {{commonly referred to as}} simply the Burlington Skyway.|$|E

40|$|Microstructure in the damascene {{interconnects}} evolves {{with the}} <b>overburden</b> layer, an excessive metal layer over trenches. We {{present the results}} of three-dimensional simulation, which show the effects of <b>overburden</b> thickness on mi-crostructure evolution in a trench. When {{the thickness of the}} <b>overburden</b> is {{less than half of the}} trench depth, for a trench with the aspect ratio of unity, the microstructure in the trench tends to evolve into a bamboo structure. This effect is discussed in terms of grain sizes in the trench and those in the over-burden. The thinner <b>overburden</b> layer would have smaller grains, of which growth is limited by its thickness. Such small-sized grains in the <b>overburden</b> are not likely to grow into the trench, which hardly make grain boundaries in the trench. Meanwhile, the grains from the trench are able to continue growth inside the trench, resulting in a bamboo structure. <b>Overburden</b> thickness af-fects the reliability and the electrical performance of the damascene copper in-terconnects. Optimization of <b>overburden</b> thickness is required to minimize these effects...|$|R

The conclusion is drawn that <b>overburden</b> layer thickness is above 40 m,air leakage influence on pit temperature is relatively little, thus offering scientific basis for rational <b>overburden</b> layer thickness and structure of open pit into underground mining...|$|R
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the arid zone of Western Australia, {{regolith}} <b>overburden</b> is characterised by high levels of salinity and or sodicity (Osborne et al. 1996). In addition, on base metal mines, the <b>overburden</b> may still contain significant levels of the minerals of interest. In other cases, sulfide minerals in the <b>overburden</b> require special handling strategies to avoid acid mine drainage. Thus waste dumps containing <b>overburden</b> embrace a range of difficult constraints to revegetation. The chemical properties of two waste dump substrates derived from <b>overburden</b> and one sub-soil at Bulong Nickel Operation (BNO) were investigated to determine the nature of the material and its suitability for growth of the legume, Acacia acuminata ssp. burkittii and the salt tolerant blue bush, Maireana pyramidata...|$|R
40|$|<b>Overburden</b> at a {{coal mine}} in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, was stored in a flat-topped {{artificial}} mound with 14 -degree side slopes. Topsoil was scarce, dispersive and readily eroded. A split-plot factorial experiment applied an enhanced municipal solid waste compost at 0, 60 or 100  t ha(- 1) to untreated <b>overburden</b> or to <b>overburden</b> covered with 0. 1  m of topsoil. Two seeding treatments, of trees and shrubs or of pasture species, were applied to two 0. 5 -ha replicates of each surface treatment. Substrate {{physical and chemical properties}} and vegetation attributes were assessed 2. 5 years later. Compost application to both topsoil and <b>overburden</b> significantly increased total N, P, Cu and Zn, soluble K, Ca and Mg, and significantly reduced soluble Na and pH. Mean tree density, size and total canopy cover were significantly greater with compost applied at 60  t ha(- 1) to <b>overburden</b> than with all other treatments, especially those on topsoil where tree growth was inhibited by undesired species. Compost application to <b>overburden</b> and topsoil at 100  t ha(- 1) significantly increased biomass of desired pasture species and significantly reduced undesired species cover compared with unamended topsoil and the extent of bare ground compared with unamended <b>overburden.</b> Successful development of woody species on <b>overburden</b> and pastures on both <b>overburden</b> and topsoil treated with compost provides opportunities for new combinations of landscape design, surface preparation and plant species introductions to increase the stability of final landforms, the effectiveness of resource use, and the delivery of commercial and biodiversity benefits from mine site rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Basement {{aquifers}} {{are usually}} developed within the weathered, over-burdened and fractured bedrock of crystalline rocks which {{can provide a}} sizeable amount of groundwater if the <b>overburden</b> is relatively thick enough to store percolating water. This study assessed the static water level and <b>overburden</b> pattern for sustainable groundwater development and management in Ilorin city, Nigeria. The data on depth of boreholes, depth to water, water level of 100 boreholes and the Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) data conducted before the borehole were drilled, were collected from Kwara State Ministry of Water Resources and Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority, Ilorin. All the Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) data collected were conducted with ABEM SAS- 1000 Terrameter using the Schlumberger electrode configuration, and the electrode spacing (AB/ 2) varied from 10 m to 200 m. From the manual interpretation of each VES curve, we estimated the <b>overburden</b> thicknesses. Field work was embarked on to get the coordinates (locations) of the sampled points using handheld GPS. Pearson Moment Correlation Coefficient was applied to determine the level of association between borehole parameters and thickness of <b>overburden.</b> The static water level and contour map were computed with the data on depth to water and the coordinates to show the pattern of water level in Ilorin, using ArcGIS 10. 2 and Surfer 12 GIS software. The depth of <b>overburden</b> and the point location collected were also used to plot the <b>overburden</b> map using IDW interpolation. This study classified Ilorin into poor (<b>overburden</b> < 10 m), marginal (10 m- 19 m <b>overburden)</b> and good or high zone (<b>overburden</b> ≥ 20 m) of groundwater potentials. The spatial pattern of <b>overburden</b> depth revealed {{that the majority of}} Ilorin city was underlain by marginally thick <b>overburden.</b> The study concluded that sustainable groundwater development and management in Ilorin city could only be attained by controlling the indiscriminate drilling of boreholes (wells), continuous mapping and regular updating of the available records on groundwater resources...|$|R
