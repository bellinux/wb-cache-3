50|$|Evinrude <b>Outboard</b> <b>Motors</b> is an American {{company that}} builds a major brand of <b>outboard</b> <b>motors</b> for boats.

It is now a subsidiary of North American Bombardier Recreational Products.|$|R
25|$|Miller Freeman carried three boats: a 26-foot (7.9-meter) Hammerhead Munson Launch with a {{capacity}} of nine people, a 185-horsepower (138-kW) motor and {{a top speed of}} 21 knots; a five-person rigid-hulled inflatable boat with a 130-horsepower (97-kW) Hamilton jet inboard motor capable of 40 miles per hour (64km/hr); and a 15-foot (4.6-meter) Zodiac inflatable boat with a 25-horsepower (18.6-kW) <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{was a young}} {{engineer}} {{right out}} of college when he received his first of his over 200 patents. He purchased an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> manufacturing company in Cedarburg, Wisconsin in 1939, intending to make magnetic separators for the area's dairy industry. The company had 300 defective motors, which he rebuilt and sold to catalog company Montgomery Ward. Orders kept coming for the motors, and Kiekhaefer Corporation was born.|$|E
25|$|Her {{class was}} built to U.S. Coast Guard standards, with an {{aluminum}} hull and superstructure. In addition, a 4-meter rigid inflatable boat powered by a 40-hp <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> is stowed amidships. She has a complement of 12. The ship {{is equipped with a}} Raytheon AN/SPS-64(V)11 Navigation/Surface Search Radar, but with a smaller antenna as those used in bigger Philippine Navy ships. Like all other Philippine Navy ships, the entire class was installed with the Philippine Navy Vessel Tracking System (VTS) by the Naval Sea Systems Command.|$|E

25|$|In 1957 Kiekhaefer {{introduced}} the Mark 75 motor, the industry's first 6-cylinder 60hp (horsepower) <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b> Two Mark 75 motors set an endurance record by running for 34 days, 11 hours, 47 minutes, and 5.4 seconds nonstop and over 25,000 miles. The motors were refueled on the run, and averaged 30.3mph (miles per hour). In 1961 Kiekhaefer Marine {{merged with the}} Brunswick Corporation. Later that year Kiekhaefer would use his NASCAR and boat engineering skills to develop the 100hp stern drive engine now known as MerCruiser. Kiekhaefer resigned {{as president of the}} company in 1969, and the company name changed to Mercury Marine.|$|E
25|$|During the {{planning}} stages of Sea Lion, it was deemed desirable to provide the advanced infantry detachments (making the initial landings) with greater protection from small-arms and light artillery fire by lining the sides of a Type A barge with concrete. Wooden slides were also installed along the barge’s hull to accommodate ten assault boats (Sturmboote), each capable of carrying six infantrymen and powered by a 30hp <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b> The extra weight of this additional armour and equipment reduced the barge’s load capacity to 40 tons. By mid-August, 18 of these craft, designated Type AS, had been converted, and another five were ordered on 30 September.|$|E
25|$|The MTs had {{a length}} of 5.62m and a beam of 1.62m. They were {{propelled}} by a 95horsepower Alfa Romeo AR 6cc <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> and developed a maximum speed of 33knots at full load. The boats were specially equipped to be launched from a surface mother ship and then make their way through obstacles such as torpedo nets. The pilot would steer the assault craft {{on a collision course}} at his target ship, and then would jump from his boat before impact and warhead detonation. The pilot's cockpit was at the rear, in order to ensure an even distribution of weight with the 330kg explosive charge inside the bow.|$|E

500|$|The {{machine was}} a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot {{standing}} on a platform, secured by a safety harness. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the [...] diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit. The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags {{at the end of}} each arm of the frame along with a large rubber float in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.|$|E
500|$|His work Paddling Home, a [...] {{floating}} house, {{was set to}} sea in January 2010. The work, symbolising the Hong Kong's {{property market}} where the accommodation is high-density, small and pricey, was selected at the Hong Kong & Shenzhen Bi City Biennale of Urbanism Architecture exhibition that year. The design includes tiled walls, wooden floorboards, bay windows, a television, air-conditioning, roof space from which to drive a few golf balls and a 5-horsepower <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b> It was priced at a symbolical HK$888,888 ($114,000). Wong said that, as the square foot price is [...] HK$55,555, Paddling Home is an ironic statement comparing the perils of owning a glitzily- and glossily-packaged high end residence to being on the high seas. When asked in 2012, Wong said he considers Paddling Home his most challenging work to date.|$|E

500|$|During {{its service}} in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos {{was part of the}} border patrol detachment. In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the [...] "Kaštela" [...] {{tactical}} group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> boat loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote control plane parts in a hobby store. Handed over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen-class torpedo boat Pionir II (TČ-224) while Mukos itself was left adrift.|$|E
500|$|The California Department of Water Resources {{includes}} San Juan Creek in the [...] San Juan Hydrologic Unit, {{which includes}} the coastal watersheds of Aliso Creek, Salt Creek, Prima Deshecha Cañada, Segunda Deshecha Cañada, and San Mateo Creek, which share a similar range of elevations and climate. Elevation in the Hydrologic Unit ranges from sea level to [...] at Santiago Peak (the headwater of Holy Jim Creek, a tributary of Trabuco Creek). The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Almost all the precipitation occurs between October and April; the average rainfall is , although mountain areas often receive higher amounts. San Juan Creek receives extra runoff from agriculture, urban areas, and other human sources, resulting in unnatural dry season flows that carry trash, heavy metals, oils, pesticides and fertilizer into the creek. The heaviest source of pollution is Oso Creek. Michael Hazzard, a Southern California environmentalist, said after diving into Upper Oso Creek Reservoir: [...] "I spent three days diving to retrieve an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> and my skin broke out in hives and boils and my gallbladder suffered and I later had six operations over a 2-year period." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> the [...] "semi-dory" [...] or [...] "half-dory" [...] was developed. [...] Because typical dory bottoms are so narrow, the thrust of an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> pushes the stern of the dory down creating a very unstable and inefficient boat. The semi-dory is basically a Swampscott dory with the stern widened and the rocker straightened aft to support the thrust of the <b>outboard</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
