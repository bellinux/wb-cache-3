They are wrong in my opinion." [...] On October 20, 1981, Ford stated stopping the Reagan administration's Saudi arms package could have a large negative impact to American relations in the Middle East during a news conference.|$|E

It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders. Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the [...] "liberty" [...] <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> such as {{to make it possible}} for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family, without being ku-kluxed, perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged, and his property destroyed. The idea of the [...] "liberty" [...] of this country [...] "enlightening the world," [...] or even Patagonia, is ridiculous in the extreme.|$|E
500|$|Next, Albert Goldman (then an English {{professor}} at Columbia University) and author and playwright Gore Vidal debated homosexuality, {{with an emphasis}} on the presence of homosexuals in the creative arts. Goldman asserted that homosexuality [...] "is just one of a number of...things all tending toward the subversion, toward the final erosion, of our cultural values." [...] Vidal, asserting that homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality, countered by saying [...] "The United States is living out some mad Protestant nineteenth-century dream of human behavior....I think the so-called breaking of the moral fiber <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> one of the healthiest things that's begun to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of Hayes's {{foreign policy}} {{concerns}} involved Latin America. In 1878, following the Paraguayan War, he arbitrated a territorial dispute between Argentina and Paraguay. Hayes awarded the disputed {{land in the}} Gran Chaco region to Paraguay, and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city (Villa Hayes) and a department (Presidente Hayes) in his honor. Hayes was also perturbed over the plans of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which was then owned by Colombia. Concerned about a repetition of French adventurism in Mexico, Hayes interpreted the Monroe Doctrine firmly. In a message to Congress, Hayes explained his opinion on the canal: [...] "The policy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> a canal under American control... The United States cannot consent to the surrender of this control to any European power or any combination of European powers." ...|$|E
500|$|The Reform Act {{strengthened}} the House of Commons {{by reducing the}} number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. [...] Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: [...] "If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, {{there is no doubt that}} the constitution of this House, and <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>is</b> at an end. [...] here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision." [...] The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington's fears would come to pass.|$|E

That evening, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis presided over a large meeting in Boston's Melodeon Hall, while Lucy Stone served as secretary. Stone, Henry C. Wright, William Lloyd Garrison, and Samuel Brooke spoke of the need for such a convention. Garrison, whose name had headed the first woman suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature the previous year, said, [...] "I conceive that the first thing to be done by the women <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> to demand their political enfranchisement. Among the 'self-evident truths' announced in the Declaration of Independence is this – 'All government derives its just power from the consent of the governed.'" [...] The meeting decided to call a convention and set Worcester, Massachusetts, as the place and October 16 and 17, 1850, as the date. It appointed Davis, Stone, Abby Kelley Foster, Harriot Kezia Hunt, Eliza J. Kenney, Dora Taft, and Eliza H. Taft a committee of arrangements, with Davis and Stone as the committee of correspondence.|$|E
