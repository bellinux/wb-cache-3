50|$|<b>Octodrine</b> is a {{stimulant}} drug whose pharmacology {{was briefly}} {{studied in the}} early 1950s. A platinum complex form of the molecule was also investigated as a possible anti-tumor drug.|$|E
40|$|Uropathogenic E. coli is a {{major cause}} of urinary tract infections (UTIs), but current {{antibiotics}} do not always effectively clear the persistent infection. To identify drugs that eliminate uropathogenic E. coli persisters, we screened a clinical drug library consisting of 1524 compounds using high throughput drug exposure assay in 96 -well plates. Bacterial survival was assessed by growth on LB plates. We identified 14 drug candidates (tosufloxacin, colistin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin, <b>octodrine,</b> clofoctol, dibekacin, cephalosporin C, pazufloxacin, streptomycin and neomycin), which had high anti-persister activity. Among them, tosufloxacin and colistin had the highest anti-persister activity and could completely eradicate E. coli persisters in 3 days in vitro while the current UTI antibiotics failed to do so. Our findings may have implications {{for the development of a}} more effective treatment for UTIs...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} and antioxidant {{properties of the}} ethanolic extract of Tetrapleura tetraptera fruit peels were investigated. Dried peels of T. tetraptera fruits were extracted with ethanol. The extract was subjected to preliminary phytochemical screening using standard procedures. GCâMS was used in identifying the secondary metabolites. The antioxidant properties of the extract were determined by its ferric reducing activity, 2, 2 â²-diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) radicals scavenging activities, and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in hepatic tissues of albino male rats. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, terpenoids and phlebotannin. GCâMS analysis revealed the presence of D-fructose, piperazine, <b>octodrine,</b> glycidol, glyceraldehydes, 6 -octadecenoic acid and 9, 12 -octadecenoic acid, with Dâfructose being the most predominant compound. The extract exhibited high antioxidant activities both in vitro and ex vivo, as indicated by its ability to scavenge DPPH and nitric oxide as well as inhibition of lipid peroxidation. This is further portrayed by its ferric reducing activity. These results suggest an antioxidant protective effect of the extract against oxidative hepatic damage and {{can be attributed to}} a synergetic action of the identified bioactive compounds.
