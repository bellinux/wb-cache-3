5|$|Mt. Rainier is {{considered}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> volcanoes in the world, {{and it is}} on the Decade Volcano list. Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt.

5|$|Nearly 100 journalists, bloggers {{and writers}} have been kidnapped or killed in Mexico since 2000, making the country <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{places on the}} planet in which to be a journalist.

5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new Hunter enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The Hunter serves as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter is a powerful and resilient enemy which players must often run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined {{the size of}} a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> triple-double threats of all time; his 138triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.|$|E

5|$|Vesuvius has erupted {{many times}} since {{and is the}} only volcano on the European {{mainland}} to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living nearby and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the Plinian type, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative {{plans to}} transfer the NPS segment of the parkway {{to the state of}} Maryland, who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state's reluctance to spend the money necessary to reconstruct the parkway, which was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> roads in the NPS road system.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most {{important feature of}} actinium {{is its ability to}} accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, {{large-scale}} search and rescue operations took place in the affected areas. A major disaster declaration was signed by President Bill Clinton the following day (May 4), allowing for the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. In light of the fatalities that occurred under highway overpasses, the notion of them being safe areas to seek shelter was dismissed, and they were from then on considered to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> places to be during a tornado. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. In May 2013, similar areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track were again devastated by an EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive and is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
5|$|Treviño Morales {{reportedly}} coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, {{including the}} murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down {{the plane of the}} former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it {{was not the first time}} Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes regarded as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>dangerous</b> shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered {{to be one of the}} sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
