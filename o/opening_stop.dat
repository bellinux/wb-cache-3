50|$|The {{reason for}} the <b>opening</b> <b>stopping</b> short of Dundee itself now emerged: the westward {{progress}} of construction took the line directly to the water's edge, and the uncertain ground there required a causeway; in the final approach to Dundee the line passed across the frontage of industrial premises, severing their access to the river. After some delay the railway came to an amicable agreement with the proprietors, {{which seems to have}} involved paying them to relocate their works to the river side of the new line. The area in question was known as the Carolina Port (near the present-day Market Street). From there the Dundee Harbour Trustees had secured control of the railway's planned construction: the harbour was being greatly extended at the time. This section was built under their supervision, and was known as the Trades Lane and Carolina Port Railway owned by them; it was leased to the Dundee and Arbroath Railway but remained the property of the Dundee Harbour Trustees (until 1907).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Three {{classical}} {{examples of}} marginal basins are explored {{to show the}} respective contributions of body forces and far-field stresses to the extension mechanism. Extensional stresses can be provided by: (1) the slab-pull force, which induces a retreat of the slab and which originates in the density contrast between the subducting slab (oceanic or continental) and the asthenosphere; (2) by lateral density contrasts within the crust (due to crustal thickening), which induce crustal spreading; and (3) by far-field stresses due to intra-continental deformation (continent continent collision, for example). Slab pull {{is probably the most}} efficient extensional force to provide but its effects are modulated by the con-tributions of the two other forces. The Japan Sea opened along the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent because xtensional boundary conditions were provided by the retreating Pacific subduction zone. The <b>opening</b> <b>stopped</b> as soon as the central Japan triple junction was established in its present position which resulted in a more efficient coupling between the Pacific and Eurasian Plates through the Philippine Sea Plate. The geometry of opening was further controlled by large-scale dextral strike-slip faults that run oblique to the subduction zone along> 2500 km, and which are far-field effects of the India Asia collision...|$|R

The heat had become excessive, but she held her shawl with both hands drawn tightly over her shoulders. Suddenly a wood-duck darted out of the covert blindly into the opening, struck against the blasted trunk, fell half stunned near her feet, and then, recovering, fluttered away. She had scarcely completed another circuit before the irruption {{was followed by a}} whirring bevy of quail, a flight of jays, and a sudden tumult of wings swept through the wood like a tornado. She turned inquiringly to Dunn, who had risen to his feet, but the next moment she caught convulsively at his wrist: a wolf had just dashed through the underbrush not a dozen yards away, and on either side of them they could hear the scamper and rustle of hurrying feet like the outburst of a summer shower. A cold wind arose from the opposite direction, as if to contest this wild exodus, but it was followed by a blast of sickening heat. Teresa sank at Dunn's feet in an agony of terror.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} opening {{mechanism}} of the Japan Sea in Miocene time using (1) tectonic and published palcomagnetic data along the eastem margin from the north of Hokkaido Island to Sado Island, (2) a mechanical model which is tested by small-scale physical modeling, and (3) crustal structure and bathymetric features in the Japan Sea which constrain our kinematic model and preopening reconstructions. Our main conclusions are the following. The eastern margin of the Japan Sea was, as a whole, a dextral shear zone about 100 km wide. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} existence of a ductile dextral shear zone in Central Hokkaido (Hidaka Mountains) and associated brittle deformation in western Hokkaido and northeastem Honshu. The stress field during the opening (which ended about 12 Ma ago {{at the end of the}} middle Miocene) changes from right-lateral transpression in the north to right-lateral transtension in the south. The western margin, along the Korean peninsula, during the same period, also was an active dextral shear zone. Palcomagnetic results indicate that clockwise rotations occurred in the south during the opening and counterclockwise rotations in the north. We propose a model of right-lateral pull-apart deformation with dockwise rotations of rigid blocks in the southern transtensional domain and counterclockwise rotations in the transpressional one. Small-scale physical models show that the clockwise rotation in transtension is possible provided that the eastern boundary (Pacific side) is free of stress. The <b>opening</b> <b>stopped</b> and compression subsequently began about 12 Ma ago.

30|$|The {{virulence}} {{test was}} conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Entomology and Bee Pathology (L-MEB), Ghent University following the protocol described by de Graaf et al. (2013) using Apis mellifera carnica larvae. Briefly, plates each consisting of 24 -wells were incubated at 34  °C for 24  h. A group of 30 larvae (in 3 wells) was treated with the Ugandan P. larvae isolate, another group of 30 larvae was treated with the P. larvae strain BRL 230010. Six (6) wells were left empty and filled with 1  ml of distilled water to avoid desiccation. Three hundred (300) µl of the spore-contaminated larval diet (20 spores of P. larvae/µl feed) was pipetted into each well of the treatment group. Three wells for the negative control group were left and fed on non-spore contaminated larval diet during the entire experiment. After 24  h of infection, larvae were transferred to a pre-warmed, fresh normal larval diet plate. The grafting tool was decontaminated between each group to avoid reinfection. Every treatment group received fresh larval diet every 24  h and the plates were analyzed each day under a stereo microscope to determine the health status of the larvae. Old feed was removed daily and replaced with pre-warmed fresh larval diet. After defecation (day 8), the larvae were transferred to pupation plates. Larvae were classified as dead when they stopped breathing (movement of tracheal <b>openings</b> <b>stops)</b> and lost body elasticity. The number of dead larvae was recorded every day. To determine whether P. larvae infection caused {{the death of a}} larva, dead larvae were plated out on MYPGP plates. Plates were incubated for 3  days at 37  °C to allow the growth of vegetative bacteria. Positive AFB infection was confirmed by growth of P. larvae. Further confirmation was provided by performing P. larvae-specific PCR-analysis of colonies grown from larval remains.|$|R

50|$|By <b>opening</b> the <b>stop</b> wider, similar {{deviations}} arise for lateral {{points as}} have been already discussed for axial points; {{but in this}} case they are much more complicated. The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal ray of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis. From this appearance it takes its name. The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil—formerly the only one considered—is coma in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by Arthur König and Moritz von Rohr, and later by Allvar Gullstrand.|$|R

The Barry Railway purchased two steam rail motors from the North British Locomotive Co; they were very similar to contemporary GWR railmotors. It ran the motor cars between Barry and Cardiff (via Tynycaeau Junction). The service started on 1 May 1905, with the motor cars intermingled with conventional trains. It appears that the Tonteg platform was indeed very short, so that conventional trains {{were not allowed to}} stop, but St Y Nyll seems to have been long enough for ordinary trains to use it.|$|R
