5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (<b>open)</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, air rushes in {{to fill the}} slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
40|$|An <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list is a {{well known}} data {{structure}} in Prolog programs. It is frequently used to represent a value changing over time, while this value is referred to from several places in the data structure of the application. A weak point in this technique is that the time complexity is linear {{in the number of}} updates to the value represented by the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list. In this programming pearl we present a variant of the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> list, namely an <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> tree, with an update and access time complexity logarithmic in the number of updates to the value. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of European Industrial Training [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 0309 - 0590. htm. Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections...|$|R

25|$|A bread clip is {{a device}} {{used to hold}} plastic bags, {{such as the ones}} pre-sliced bread is {{commonly}} packaged in, closed. They are also commonly called bread tags, bread tabs, bread ties, bread crimps, or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its <b>open</b> <b>end,</b> the clip or tie may preserve its contents longer. The bread clip was invented in 1952 by Floyd Paxton of Yakima, Washington. Paxton never patented the device.|$|E
