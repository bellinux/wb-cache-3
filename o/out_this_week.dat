The old record for most tornado reports in one week was 171 during the week of the May 1995 tornado outbreak sequence (May 12 to May 18, 1995).|$|E
500|$|Joshua Alston of Newsweek {{criticized the}} episode and the {{introduction}} of the Charles character. Although Alston said Elba's acting was fine, he said the character [...] "sucked the funny out of every scene he was in" [...] and created an awkwardness inappropriate for the show. During the week following the episode's original broadcast, many fans theorized on the Internet that Michael said [...] "I acquit" [...] rather than [...] "I quit", and that Michael's supposed resignation was something of a prank. Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam on The Office, addressed this issue on her MySpace blog, saying, [...] "He said 'I quit'. [...] And he meant it. [...] You will see how it all plays <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> on the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Political satirist and {{commentator}} Rick Mercer wrote, [...] "The {{drama that}} played <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> was many things: unimaginable, embarrassing and, yes, it made our parliamentary system {{look like a}} laughingstock. However, this situation was not, as Mr. Harper insisted, undemocratic, illegal or un-Canadian." [...] The editorial board of The Globe and Mail echoed Mercer's sentiment, pointing out that Harper's statements on {{the legality of the}} coalition were [...] "knowingly erroneous" [...] and, in June 2012, Peter H. Russell said the Conservative's attacks on the legitimacy of the coalition proposal were [...] "deliberately misleading" [...] and that the notion that [...] "a multiparty government must be approved by voters beforehand is 'absolutely B.S.'" ...|$|E

In the entrance-hall, there was a stuffed fox with glass eyes, which I never should have doubted to be an actual live fox except for his keeping so quiet; also some grouse and other game.

60|$|My {{very dear}} Friend,--Have you {{expected}} to hear from me? and are you vexed with me? I am a little ambitious of the first item--yet hopeful of {{an escape from the}} last. If you did but know how I am pressed for time, and how I have too much to do every day, you would forgive me for my negligence; even if you had sent me nectar instead of mountain,[98] and I had neglected laying my gratitude at your feet. Last Saturday, upon its being discovered that my first volume consisted of only 208 pages, and my second of 280 pages, Mr. Moxon uttered a cry of reprehension, and wished to tear me to pieces by his printers, as the Bacchantes did Orpheus. Perhaps you might have heard my head moaning all the way to St. John's Wood! He wanted to tear away several poems {{from the end of the}} second volume, and tie them on to the end of the first! I could not and would not hear of this, because I had set my mind on having 'Dead Pan' to conclude with. So there was nothing for it but to finish a ballad poem called 'Lady Geraldine's Courtship,' which was lying by me, and I did so by writing, i.e. composing, one hundred and forty lines last Saturday![99] I seemed to be in a dream all day! Long lines too--with fifteen syllables in each! I see you shake your head all this way off. Moreover it is a 'romance of the age,' treating of railroads, routes, and all manner of 'temporalities,' and in so radical a temper that I expect to be reproved for it by the Conservative reviews round. By the way, did I tell you of the good news I had from America the third of this month? The 'Drama of Exile' is in the hands of a New York publisher; and having been submitted to various chief critics of the country on its way, was praised loudly and extravagantly. This was, however, by a private reading only. A bookseller at Philadelphia had announced it for publication--he intended to take it up when the English edition reached America; but upon its being represented to him that the New York publisher had proof sheets direct from the author and would give copy money, he abandoned his intention to the other. I confess I feel very much pleased at the kind spirit--the spirit of eager kindness indeed--with which the Americans receive my poetry. It is not wrong to be pleased, I hope. In this country there may be mortifications waiting for me; quite enough to keep my modesty in a state of cultivation. I do not know. I hope the work will be <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> and then! Did I explain to you that what 'Lady Geraldine's Courtship' was wanted for was to increase the size of the first volume, so as to restore the equilibrium of volumes, without dislocating 'Pan'? Oh, how anxious I shall be to hear your opinion! If you tell me that I have lost my intellects, what in the world shall I do then--what shall I do? My Americans--that is, my Americans who were in at the private reading, and perhaps I myself--are of opinion that I have made great progress since 'The Seraphim.' It seems to me that I have more reach, whether in thought or language. But then, to you it may appear quite otherwise, and I shall be very melancholy if it does. Only you must tell me the precise truth; and I trust to you that you will let me have it in its integrity.|$|E

50|$|The Top 8 {{performed}} on Monday, May 27, 2013 {{and received the}} results on Tuesday, May 28. A special look at the upcoming season of America's Got Talent was shown during air time of the results show. Danielle Bradbery only reached the iTunes top 10 after the close of voting, thus missing <b>out</b> on <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> iTunes bonus.

50|$|At panel, Trà My {{was praised}} for her couture picture and her {{significant}} image-change from a teen girl {{to a very}} attractive woman; hence, {{she was the first}} call <b>out</b> of <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> Lê Thuý got the second best photo, but she was criticized by the head judge Xuân Lan for giving bad attitude during the shoot and other activities. Landing in the bottom two were Nguyễn Tuyết and Phương Anh, Nguyễn Tuyết because the judges felt that she started to lose her model look and also easily got distracted, and Phương Anh for the judges felt she got weaker week after <b>week</b> as <b>this</b> is her third consecutive time being in the bottom two. However, Phương Anh again got another chance which means Nguyễn Tuyết was eliminated.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} long to carry <b>out</b> <b>this</b> programme--only several <b>weeks.</b> We of the Revolution caught vague rumors {{of the state of}} affairs, but had nothing {{definite}} enough for an understanding. In fact, we thought it was a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing on our part, and never dreamed that it was deliberately manufactured--and it had been manufactured so secretly, from the very innermost circle of the Iron Heel, that we had got no inkling. The counter-plot was an able achievement, and ably carried out.|$|R
5000|$|A documentary, JFK: A Homecoming, by Ryan Tubridy was {{broadcast}} on RTÉ One {{prior to the}} book's release. Bernice Harrison, reviewing the week's television in The Irish Times, commented: [...] "The timing of this history documentary - not the usual bank-holiday viewing, not an anniversary of the visit, no new revelations - was peculiar until you noted that RTÉ's star presenter has a book coming <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> about the JFK visit. Nice publicity {{if you can get}} it".|$|E

According to a review in Lost in Sound, [...] "AThere’s no place for genres in this album - it’s an {{exploration}} of countless rhythms, BPM’s, and frequencies.

They'll be working at a food bank for their [...] "jobs". The contestants are then immediately taken to a challenge, which has blue and black teams pulling 33,000 pound semis. As they pull the trucks, they need to load puzzle pieces onto the truck, {{and then at the}} end they have to assemble the puzzle that spells the award: [...] "Groceries for one year". Five members will pull the semis and the sixth will pick up puzzle pieces. The Black team, consisting of primarily small women, can't even get the truck moving at the start; the Blue team has much more initial success, and ultimately wins.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{negative}} review came from The Telegraph, Robbie Collin felt [...] "This Is Us {{has been made}} with these fans in mind, and there’s nothing like a guaranteed profit to stifle creativity. This isn't a problem peculiar to manufactured pop, either: there is a Morrissey concert film coming <b>out</b> later <b>this</b> <b>week</b> that makes One Direction: This Is Us look like Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz.". The New York Times also gave it a negative review, Miriam Bale felt [...] "With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history, it’s a shame that a filmmaker wasn't hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional. In the end credits — Richard Lester-style scenes of the boys in costumes doing pranks — we see how this film {{might have been more}} successful: as an obvious fiction starring these appealing personalities rather than a tame and somewhat fake documentary." ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{got here}} last Saturday night, we found that Mrs. Fields had not only garnished the rooms with flowers, but also with holly (with real red berries) and {{festoons}} of moss dependent from the looking-glasses and picture frames. She {{is one of the}} dearest little women in the world. The homely Christmas look of the place quite affected us. Yesterday we dined at her house, and there was a plum-pudding, brought on blazing, and not to be surpassed in any house in England. There is a certain Captain Dolliver, belonging to the Boston Custom House, who came off in the little steamer that brought me ashore from the Cuba. He took it into his head that he would have a piece of English mistletoe brought <b>out</b> in <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> Cunard, which should be laid upon my breakfast-table. And there it was this morning. In such affectionate touches as this, these New England people are especially amiable.|$|R
