40|$|With {{increasing}} production <b>of</b> red <b>mud,</b> {{the environmental}} {{problems caused by}} it are increasingly serious, and thus the integrated treatment <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> is imminent. This article {{provides an overview of}} the composition and the basic characteristics <b>of</b> red <b>mud.</b> The research progress of safe stockpiling and comprehensive utilization <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> is summarized. The safe stockpiling <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> can be divided into two aspects: the design and safe operation of the stocking yard. The comprehensive utilization <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> can be further divided into three aspects: the effective recycling of components, resource utilization and application in the field of environmental protection. This paper points out that the main focus of previous studies on red mud stockpiling is cost reproduction and land tenure. The recovery of resources from red mud has a high value-added, but low level industrialization.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} possibilities <b>of</b> using red <b>mud,</b> a waste product derived from the digestion of bauxite with a versatile mineralogical composition, as additive in concrete, grout mortar and cement paste. Two types <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> from China were used in the experiments. Concrete in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> addition on the compressive strength and dry shrinkage of concrete. Grout mortars in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> addition on the flexural and compressive strengths, dry shrinkage and water permeability of mortar. Cement paste in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> addition on the capacity of Cs adsorption and ionic leaching. The results show that addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> does not contribute to nor impair the strength of the concrete or grout mortar but instead acts as inert filler. The decrease in compressive strength of concrete with addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> is mainly due to the increased water-cement ratio. There is no significant increase in dry shrinkage of concrete with addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud,</b> but there is a certain increase in dry shrinkage of grout mortar, especially when more than 20 % of the binder is replaced by red <b>mud.</b> Addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> in grout mortar significantly increases the water permeability of the mortar due to the increased water-cement ratio. Owing to the fluctuant results from the adsorption test, it is difficult to draw a conclusion of the adsorption capacity for Cs by addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud</b> in concrete. However, the preliminary results from a quick adsorption test indicated a good adsorption behavior of cement with the addition <b>of</b> red <b>mud,</b> especially at a low initial Cs concentration...|$|R
5|$|The main {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} <b>of</b> <b>Mud</b> Creek is agricultural land, which accounts for 62.97 {{percent of the total}} area. 31.49 percent of the watershed is forested and 5.54 percent is developed land. Most of the forested land is on the watershed's southern and eastern edges, but there are some patches of it elsewhere, most of which are fairly small. Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, but there are several other small areas of development in the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo).

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E

Eggs are produced from spring to autumn, the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer, and individuals can live {{for up to two}} years.

The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted.

5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made <b>of</b> <b>mud,</b> adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick.

This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
40|$|Sugar mills {{produce a}} range of {{byproducts}} {{during the process of}} extracting sugar from cane. Mill <b>mud</b> is one <b>of</b> the byproducts produced in significant volume. The practice <b>of</b> spreading mill <b>mud</b> onto cane fields close by the mill has been the primary means of disposing <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> for many years. The continued application <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> at high rates, without appropriate recognition of its nutrient content, the soil condition, crop nutrient requirements, slope of the land, or proximity of application sites to environmentally sensitive areas has raised a number of concerns in recent years, including overfertilization, heavy-metal contamination, leaching, and offsite impacts from drainage to waterways. This study develops a regional mathematical programming model to determine optimal rates <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> application for various soil types and distances from the mill in the Mackay region in central Queensland, Australia. The optimal application rate <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> varies according to soil type and by distance from the mill. Lower rates <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> application are economically desirable at greater distances from the mill. However, when the cost <b>of</b> mill <b>mud</b> application is shared between growers and the mill operator, the optimal application rates are reduced at some locations while increasing at others.
