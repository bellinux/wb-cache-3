50|$|Hina is {{the younger}} {{sister of the}} Chocorat Sisters from the first {{generation}} of idols. She often admires her older sisters with pride and joy. Whenever Hina brings up her sisters, she goes on and on about it until someone gets sick of it. Hina also likes to make pastries, but she is very bad at it; often resulting in explosions. Later on in the series, it is also revealed that she's bad at <b>ovenware</b> in general, as she made the microwave oven explode while reheating a bowl of miso soup.|$|E
50|$|Among {{her most}} {{successful}} designs are the Boligens Byggeskabe storage system (1954-59) which she developed together with Børge Mogensen and the Stub & Stamme series of drinking glasses (1958-60) {{in cooperation with}} Ibi Trier Mørch. But above all she is remembered for her designs for the Royal Copenhagen porcelain factory, especially her Blåkant (Blue Line) faience dinner service (1965), her Hvidpot (White Pot) porcelain dinner service (1972) and her Ildpot (Fire Pot) <b>ovenware</b> (1976). In 1991, she designed the set of cutlery known as Copenhagen for Georg Jensen.|$|E

In 1958 an internal design department was started by John B. Ward. He redesigned the Pyrex <b>ovenware</b> and Flameware. Over the years, designers such as Penny Sparke, Betty Baugh, Smart Design, TEAMS Design, and others have contributed to the design of the line.|$|E
50|$|The main {{application}} envisaged for NASICON materials is as the solid electrolyte in a sodium-ion battery. Some NASICONs exhibit a {{low thermal expansion}} coefficient (< 10−6 K−1), which is useful for precision instruments and household <b>ovenware.</b> NASICONs can be doped with rare-earth elements, such as Eu, and used as phosphors. Their electrical conductivity is sensitive to molecules in the ambient atmosphere, a phenomenon {{that can be used}} to detect CO2, SO2, NO, NO2, NH3 and H2S gases. Other NASICON applications include catalysis, immobilization of radioactive waste, and sodium removal from water.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the company}} had transitioned to {{refrigerator}} products as a focal point, it still made other merchandise. One product was the company's own version of borosilicate glass, which was called [...] "heat proof" [...] glass. This glass could be moved from a refrigerator to an oven without breaking from the extreme temperature change. Heat proof glass was used for <b>ovenware</b> and coffee makers—and during World War II, it was used in searchlight products. [...] Unfortunately, the Sneath version of borosilicate glass, like the Sneath brand, was not promoted.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, glass {{manufacturers}} faced {{competition from the}} new plastics industry. Glass companies needed to change with the times or face extinction, and Sneath Glass did not make enough changes. Refrigerator parts such as drip plates were being made of plastic instead of glass, and the company declined opportunities in both fibreglass and plastics. By making glassware mostly for other companies, Sneath had lost brand recognition, {{and it did not}} promote the Sneath brand or products such as its heat proof glass. Competitors making <b>ovenware</b> products had gained much better brand recognition. This meant that the company faced declining demand for its top two categories of products.|$|E
5000|$|Lithium {{carbonate}} is {{an important}} industrial chemical. It forms low-melting fluxes with silica and other materials. Glasses derived from lithium carbonate are useful in <b>ovenware.</b> Lithium carbonate is a common ingredient in both low-fire and high-fire ceramic glaze. Its alkaline properties are conducive to changing the state of metal oxide colorants in glaze particularly red iron oxide (...) [...] Cement sets more rapidly when prepared with lithium carbonate, and is useful for tile adhesives. When added to aluminium trifluoride, it forms LiF which gives a superior electrolyte for the processing of aluminium. It is also used {{in the manufacture of}} most lithium-ion battery cathodes, which are made of lithium cobalt oxide.|$|E

5000|$|Rhineland-born Adolph Coors (1847-1929) {{opened the}} Colorado Glass Works in 1887 to {{manufacture}} beer bottles for his brewery, the Adolph Coors Brewing Company, west of Denver. In 1888, the glass works, incorporated as Coors, Binder & Co., was idled by a strike and never re-opened. [...] The Glass Works was leased to Austrian-born John J. Herold in 1910, who incorporated the Herold China and Pottery Company {{on the site}} at 600 Ninth St in Golden. [...] Herold used clay from nearby mines to make dinnerware and heat-resistant porcelain <b>ovenware</b> under the trademark Herold Fireproof China. The now-abandoned clay pits form the western boundary of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) campus. CSM professor Herman Fleck helped Herold perfect his glazing technique. [...] Adolph Coors became the majority stockholder and {{was elected to the}} board of directors of Herold China in 1912. John Herold resigned, and Adolph Coors Company acquired Herold China in 1914. Herold returned later in 1914 to manage the plant, but left permanently in 1915. CSM evaluated Fireproof China for industrial applications in 1914, and found it suitable. [...] The company began producing chemical porcelain in 1915 as a result of a World War I embargo on German imports. Adolph Coors’ second son, Herman Frederik Coors, was named manager in 1916. Herold China was renamed Coors Porcelain Company in 1920, and the trademark [...] "Coors U.S.A." [...] was first used.|$|E
