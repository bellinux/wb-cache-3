5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> were published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories,</b> it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E
5|$|Poe had {{intended}} to collect {{a number of his}} early short stories into a volume titled Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s. The collection would be unified as a series of tales presented by members of a literary club designed as burlesques of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier and the Baltimore Saturday Visiter.|$|E
50|$|The graphic {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>story</b> grammar elements {{is called a}} story map. The exact form and complexity of a map depends, of course, upon the unique structure of each narrative and the personal preference of the teacher constructing the map.|$|R

5|$|The {{source of}} many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> of Elagabalus's depravity is the Augustan History (Historia Augusta), which {{includes}} controversial claims. The Historia Augusta {{was most likely}} written {{toward the end of}} the 4th century during the reign of emperor Theodosius I. The life of Elagabalus as described in the Augustan History is of uncertain historical merit. Sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are less controversial among historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories,</b> as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
5000|$|The Turning {{sequence}} is about events which convinced conservative witches that men could handle magic responsibly. The Secrets sequence brings many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>story</b> lines to a climax. Both deal with worldwide events. Except {{for the last}} Secrets book, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were written in collaboration with Norton's fans. The Witch World series can be considered the first romantic fantasy series, both because of the content and because these books were a primary inspiration to later romantic fantasy authors like Mercedes Lackey.|$|R

50|$|There {{is no real}} {{plot that}} runs {{throughout}} this documentary. Instead, each skater was placed into their segment to showcase their skills. Some of the skaters also incorporated a short story into their segments. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>story</b> lines include McCrank looking for a job, Berra being killed by an unknown attacker, Reynolds hanging out with a monkey, Kirchart and Klein's rampaging mayhem {{in the city and}} Lasek taking down Hawk so that Lasek can become the number one skateboarder.|$|R
5|$|While the game's cutscenes are {{animated}} with 3D graphics, {{the team}} recorded live-action videos {{to introduce the}} real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> into the game's script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic peaks of the island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest of them all, with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> agree that the Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{continued}} to publish novels set in China through 1887, writing five in this period. Several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> {{were based on}} extant Chinese tales, as retold by his Chinese-speaking friends. The writer sold his shares in Pembrita Betawi to Karsseboom&Co. in 1887, but {{continued to}} print the newspaper until it– and Lie's printing press– were acquired by Albrecht&Co. later that year. Lie did not work as a publisher again, although he continued to contribute writings to various newspapers, including Meulenhoff's new publication Hindia Olanda. Over {{the next three years}} he did not have fixed employment, taking a multitude of jobs, including bamboo salesman, contractor, and cashier.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>stories</b> or films violate {{fundamental}} principles of causality and relativity, since the information-theoretic {{structure of the}} path space of multiple universes (that is, information flow between different paths) is very likely complex.|$|E

50|$|The Stray Dog {{was first}} {{published}} by the Bazargani Nejat publication in Tehran in 1942. It consists of eight short stories and is Sadegh Hedayat's last short story collection. The exact writing time <b>of</b> <b>these</b> short <b>stories</b> is unknown today, however based on what Hadayat had written in his letters, {{it is believed that}} most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> short <b>stories</b> had been written before 1942. Before 1942, Hedayat wasn't able to publish anything, because of Reza Shah's censorship system. After the abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, it was the best time for Hedayat to publish his writings.|$|R

25|$|The Vadakkan Pattukal are ballads that extol {{the adventures}} of the {{brave men and women}} of North Malabar.
