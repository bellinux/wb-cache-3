5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E

Bradman then fielded a first-choice team; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Ian Johnson's inclusion {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring.
