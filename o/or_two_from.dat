25|$|Any two {{vertices}} in a rook's graph {{are either}} at distance one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> each other, {{according to whether}} they are adjacent or nonadjacent respectively. Any two nonadjacent vertices may be transformed into any other two nonadjacent vertices by a symmetry of the graph. When the rook's graph is not square, the pairs of adjacent vertices fall into two orbits of the symmetry group according to whether they are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but when the graph is square any two adjacent vertices may also be mapped into each other by a symmetry and the graph is therefore distance-transitive.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2005/2006 academic year, UCD introduced the Horizons curriculum, which completely semesterised and modularised all undergraduate programmes enhancing the quality and flexibility of the standard university education. Under the Horizons curriculum, new undergraduate students have greater choice in what exactly they study in their programme. Under the new curriculum, students choose ten core modules from their specific subject area and two other modules, which can be chosen from any other programme across the entire University (this applies in the majority of programmes, however some exceptions, as in Arts Omnibus and Business & Law, can apply). For example, a student studying Stage 1 Commerce as his primary degree programme can also choose one module (<b>or</b> <b>two)</b> <b>from</b> the Stage 1 Law programme (subject to space availability, timetable constraints and so on).|$|E

500|$|A {{relatively}} negative review {{came from}} Chicago Sun-Times critic Lon Grahnke, who criticized Seinfeld's {{part in the}} episode: [...] "this comedy series must ride {{on the shoulders of}} its star.

Overall, Grahnke commented [...] "At his best, Seinfeld draws a chuckle <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> his middle-brow remarks on modern life and its perplexing contradictions. At his worst, the comedian shows the smugness of a detached star who can mechanically control the level of laughter that greets whatever quip he may utter." ...|$|E

The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies, 9th Infantry, who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck, was on a southern knob of Hill 209, [...] south of B Company's higher position. In addition to the D and H Company men, there were a few from the Heavy Mortar Platoon and one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> B Company. Altogether, 60 to 70 men were in the group. The group had an SCR-300 radio, a heavy machine gun, two light machine gun, a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, about 20 M1 Garand rifles, and about 40 carbines or pistols. Schmitt assumed command of the group.|$|E
500|$|Of Presley's {{films in}} the 1960s, 15 were {{accompanied}} by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: [...] "three ballads, one medium-tempo , one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie". As the decade wore on, {{the quality of the}} soundtrack songs grew [...] "progressively worse". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films. The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: [...] "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it." [...] Most of the film albums featured a song <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be [...] "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll." [...] Regardless of the songs' quality, {{it has been argued that}} Presley generally sang them well, with commitment. Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: [...] "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and 'Rock-a-Hula Baby.'" ...|$|E

500|$|GamePro rated it {{a perfect}} 5 out of 5 score in its March 1992 issue. The {{reviewer}} Monty Haul {{stated that it}} [...] "truly redefines the standards for fantasy adventure games," [...] proclaiming that [...] "one-dimensional characters, needless hack 'em combat, and linear gameplay will be things of the past if other RPGs learn a lesson <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> this cart," [...] concluding that it [...] "is one small step for Square Soft, and one giant leap for SNES role-playing games." [...] In the November 1993 issue of Dragon, Sandy Petersen gave it an [...] "Excellent" [...] rating. He criticized the [...] "stylized" [...] combat system and the graphics as [...] "inferior" [...] to Zelda, but praised how every [...] "spell has a different on-screen effect" [...] and the difficulty for being [...] "just about right" [...] where bosses [...] "nearly beat you every time" [...] unlike other RPG's such as Ultima where [...] enough [...] "adventuring" [...] {{makes it possible to}} [...] "trash" [...] enemies [...] "with ease." [...] He praised the [...] "great" [...] music, preferring it over Zelda, stating what it [...] "lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in sound." [...] He praised the story in particular, noting that, in a departure from other RPGs where the party always [...] "sticks together through thick and thin," [...] the characters have their own motives for joining and leaving the group, with one that [...] "even betrays" [...] them. He stated that it is like [...] "following the storyline of a fantasy novel," [...] comparing it to The Lord of the Rings and Man in the Iron Mask, concluding that, because [...] "the characters often spoke up for themselves," [...] he [...] "got much more attached" [...] to the party [...] "than in any other computer game." ...|$|E

[...] At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff.|$|E
2500|$|The Philadelphian cricket {{team was}} a team that {{represented}} Philadelphia in first-class cricket between 1878 and 1913. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia: Germantown, Merion, Belmont, and Philadelphia. Players from smaller clubs, such as Tioga and Moorestown, and local colleges, such as Haverford, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 88 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 45 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion. The [...] "Gentlemen of Philadelphia" [...] were able to win at least a match <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>from</b> all of the foreign sides that visited.
