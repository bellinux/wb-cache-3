The last Marquis <b>of</b> <b>Extended</b> Grance was Zhu Yuxun (朱煜勳). In 1912, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, some advocated that a Han Chinese be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis <b>of</b> <b>Extended</b> Grace.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-6th century, as Buddhism {{was brought}} to Japan from Baekje, new styles of shrine {{architecture}} were introduced; today's Shinto shrine blueprint is of Buddhist origin. The concept of temples {{as a place of}} assembly was applied to shrines. Spaces for worship were added in the form <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> roofs or worship halls (haiden) in addition to the main hall (honden). The following stylistic elements of Buddhist temple architecture were assimilated and applied to Japanese shrines: column-base stones, brackets, curved roofs, painted surfaces, metal ornaments, corridors and pagodas.|$|E
25|$|John Conway {{devised a}} {{terminology}} for stellated polygons, polyhedra and polychora (Coxeter 1974). In this system the process <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> edges {{to create a}} new figure is called stellation, that <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> faces is called greatening and that <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> cells is called aggrandizement (this last does not apply to polyhedra). This allows a systematic use of words such as 'stellated', 'great, and 'grand' in devising names for the resulting figures. For example Conway proposed some minor variations to the names of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.|$|R

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} the potential {{costs and benefits}} of allowing foster youth to remain in care until age 21, the policy encouraged by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act and proposed in California’s Assembly Bill 12, the California Fostering Connections to Success Act. Our estimates of the costs <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> care are based on the experience of Illinois in providing care past age 18 and data on public assistance receipt by youth aging out of foster care. Our estimates of the potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> care are based on college participation rates at age 21 suggestive of the effect <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> care on post-secondary educational attainment as well as data on increased work-life earnings associated with post-secondary education. Our analyses lead to the following conclusions: • We estimate that the average per youth cost <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> foster to age 21, net cost offsets associated with public assistance utilization when youth cannot remain in care, to be approximately $ 37, 948. Available state-level data on public assistance utilization suggest that the net cost <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> care in California may be a few hundred dollars less than our estimate.

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
5|$|During February 2009, {{following}} on from {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> discussions with the British National Space Centre (which later became the UK Space Agency), {{it was announced that}} a major funding agreement had been established between the British National Space Centre, ESA and REL, committing €1million ($1.28million) for the purpose of producing a demonstration engine for the Skylon programme by 2011. The initiative, known as the Technology Demonstration Programme, was scheduled to last approximately 2.5years, during which further financing in the form of €1million was made available by the ESA. The 2009 agreement allowed REL to involve several external companies, including EADS-owned Astrium, the University of Bristol and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in further development work. As a consequence of the enactment of the Technology Demonstration Programme, REL was able to transition from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2/3 up to 4/5 within a matter of months.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this period}} <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> service, Robinson was brought home, {{appointed}} Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian Sea service, promoted again to Captain and posted to HMS Iron Duke. Robinson then {{served in a}} number of training establishments and dockyards, as well as a brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge {{for the rest of his}} life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII's Freedom Cross. Eventually a bout of ill-health caused by a combination of the strain of long service, his age, and the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS Neptune in December 1941, prompted a second retirement in 1942.|$|E

The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia.
