2500|$|Thomson later {{recognized}} {{those aspects}} as {{being part of}} Altman's style, beginning with MASH (1970): [...] "MASH began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom {{that there was no}} sense of composition. That is what makes Nashville so absorbing." [...] Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: [...] "If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be talking."

They lack English servility, it is true--but they could acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the register of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front! show his lordship to four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it. This sort of thing shall cease at once. I will hunt up the American Claimant the first thing in the morning, accomplish my mission, then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name." ...|$|E

They went up to the Basin bank and got lots of salt out of the holes in the barrels lying there, and then they ate all the apples they could hold, and after that they cut limber sticks off the trees, and {{sharpened}} the points, and stuck apples on them and threw them.

[...] Wolf said he was thrilled with the deal because [...] "my stated goal has been to keep all three shows (L&O, CI, & SVU) up and running." [...] Both {{the original}} series and Criminal Intent won full 22-episode orders, although most series for cable channels do not produce more than 13.

Ben's wife Ramona confronts the couple over Marge's secret correspondence with Ben, but Homer and Marge explain that two people in a healthy relationship should not keep secrets from one another.

5000|$|Matt Suhey ran for 112 yards, {{a career}} best. The {{game was played}} in a heavy downpour, which contributed to the {{attendance}} of 36,816, the lowest in Buccaneer history. Jerry Golsteyn started in place of Jack Thompson, who had a bruised elbow. The Buccaneers totaled only 132 yards of offense, 42 of it on a single pass from Golsteyn to Kevin House {{at the end of}} the first half. The ineffective Golsteyn was replaced with Jeff Komlo in the fourth quarter. Golsteyn completed 3 of 13 passes for 49 yards and an interception. The Bears' 273 yards rushing was the most the Buccaneers had ever allowed, just one week after an opponent compared the physicality of the Tampa Bay defense to that of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Komlo was sacked three times, and his first pass was intercepted. He moved ahead of Golsteyn on the depth chart following the game. It was the first time since 1977, the week before their first franchise victory, that the Buccaneers had been shut out on consecutive weekends.

5000|$|The finale was warmly {{received}} by television critics. Alan Sepinwall praised the finale and the season, and observed {{that many of}} the characters, through their actions (using Don's marriage, Joan's pregnancy, and Betty's firing of Carla and moving out of the Ossining house as examples), were trying to create a fresh start. He predicted that during the fifth season that [...] "many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find these fresh starts feeling like the stale lives they had before." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine enjoyed the episode but was nonplussed by the small focus on the agency storyline, calling it [...] "a pretty big oversight in ending the season, when the second half of it had largely been devoted to SCDP’s existential crisis." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN considered it a good finale, saying, [...] "It's our nature to compare this season finale with last year's game-changing, super exciting one, and I'm guessing most will feel it comes up short. But really, 'Shut the Door. Have a Seat' was so unique among Mad Men episodes, and it would have felt artificial to have something that huge happen again to the company itself in the subsequent finale." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode, noting that [...] "however low-key its tone, I think “Tomorrowland” shakes up the status quo as profoundly as 'Shut The Door. Have A Seat.' Don’s been heading in one direction—down—all season and now he’s not[...]. Don seems to realize {{for the first time this}} week that he has his whole life ahead of him." ...|$|E

Actor Mammootty boards the train from Thrissur and gets into the same coach. Nadar leaves the train at Palakkad after giving company with Tony and gang and the new TTE Chokalingam a.k.a.
