A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E

5|$|In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, {{experienced}} a jolt {{that caused the}} #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating. This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> alert status.

5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E

5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate.

5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> and mitochondrial genes.|$|E

In addition to his work <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of violets after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the New York Botanical Garden Journal was on Apetahia raiateensis, a rare flower found only on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. He travelled to Polynesia many times, and translated Grammar of the Tahitian language from French into English. His family served as hosts for a time to two young people from Tahiti and Samoa.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, Bohr helped {{refugees}} from Nazism.

In September 1943, word reached Bohr {{that he was about to}} be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation <b>on</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E
