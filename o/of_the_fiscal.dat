Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E

He was promoted to brigadier general in April 1953, and in July he became Fiscal Director of the Marine Corps. He was involved in fiscal strategy hearings before the U.S. Congress, and established a programming system where officers researched and thought out programs before bringing them to Congress. This idea met with resistance from Marine leaders who favored going to the Hill to figure out the details of programs. While serving in this capacity, he was promoted to major general in September 1955.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E

As the demand pressure from exiting foreign investors eases, the dollar exchange rate against the Egyptian pound is expected to decline. It stands at EGP 7.00 per USD as of 18 June 2013. Due to the rising power of the US dollar, as of January 2015 one dollar equals 7.83 Egyptian pounds.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{empirical}} estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk-sharing and redistributive properties <b>of</b> <b>fiscal</b> equalization among <b>the</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German federation. <b>Fiscal</b> equalization serves <b>the</b> {{dual role}} <b>of</b> insuring regional income against asymmetric revenue shocks (i. e., short-run income differences), and decreasing long-run differences by redistributing tax revenues among states. In our empirical study, we evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German <b>fiscal</b> system between 1970 and 2006. We find that tax revenue sharing and <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> equalization mechanism (Länderfinanzausgleich) together {{lead to a}} redistribution of 36. 9 percent of state income, with a contribution of 5. 5 percent by the Länderfinanzausgleich, for the period 1970 to 1994. After <b>the</b> full integration <b>of</b> East German states into the mechanism in 1995, redistributive effects drop to about 35 percent. <b>The</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Länderfinanzausgleich increases significantly – to 14 percent – for this period.
