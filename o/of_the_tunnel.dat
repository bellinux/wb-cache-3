5|$|The tunnel {{proved to}} be a {{constant}} nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground water seepage, and the isolated location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, and were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|A third bore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see any progress towards construction over a decade later. This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, and concern about increased traffic on the A12.|$|E
50|$|The twin 2.25 km tunnels between Jalan Besar, Bendemeer and Geylang Bahru {{stations}} were bored under old pre-war shophouses along Jalan Besar Road and required careful and stringent control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnelling</b> works beneath it. <b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> were constructed using steel-fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) segments, {{the first in}} South East Asia, which enhances the long term durability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{began on}} October 12, 1914, using a {{tunneling}} shield {{in conjunction with}} compressed air. The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Clifford Milburn Holland, who later served as the first chief engineer of the Holland Tunnel. The north tube was holed through on November 28, 1916.|$|E
5|$|Following {{three years}} of renovation, the lower section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was reopened {{to the public in}} 2014 as part of the Ramsgate Tunnels tourist attraction. The tunnels were {{formally}} reopened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent in a ceremony on 27 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|For {{four years}} the workmen, {{some of whom}} brought their families, lived in 300 {{temporary}} wooden bothies either in a field alongside the offices and workshops, opposite the cemetery, or elsewhere along the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Day– and night–shift workers lived up to 17 per hut taking turns to use the beds in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Several {{options were}} considered, {{including}} dualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> addition <b>of</b> two lanes {{through a large}} road cut in the mountain, leaving the other two lanes in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>tunnel</b> with an open cut to the north. Citing the high maintenance costs <b>of</b> a <b>tunnel,</b> <b>the</b> replacement option was ultimately chosen.|$|R

5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd to the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> for no apparent reason.|$|E

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), and underneath the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches. The impending completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> also sparked real estate interests in Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead.

The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, {{due in part to}} the work delays.|$|E
