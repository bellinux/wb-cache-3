5|$|After an {{extensive}} refit {{in the aftermath}} of the Unsan battle, ROK 1st Infantry Division was placed on the US I Corps right flank at Yongsan-dong on November 20. As part of the Home-by-Christmas Offensive, the ROK 1st Infantry Division was to advance north and to capture the town of Taechon while the US 35th Infantry Regiment of the US 25th Infantry Division was advancing north from Yongsan-dong <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> right flank. At the same time, the US 24th Infantry Division of the US I Corps would advance towards Chongju on the ROK 1st Infantry Division's left flank.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1951 the Korean War {{had entered}} {{a period of}} {{relative}} stalemate. With the resignation of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in June 1952, General Matthew Ridgway of the United Nations Command was transferred from Korea to Europe as Eisenhower's replacement. The United States Army appointed General Mark Wayne Clark, commander of the US Fifth Army during World War II, to overall command <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> Peninsula {{as a replacement for}} Ridgway.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (reigned 604â€“618), the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, while the successive military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy ("Mandate of Heaven") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> campaigns, {{and by the time}} he realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late: as revolts spread, in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E

50|$|On 1 June 1871, an unprovoked {{attack was}} made on two ships of the {{squadron}} by shore batteries from two <b>Korean</b> forts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Salee River. When no explanation was offered, a punitive expedition known as the Sinmiyangyo was mounted that destroyed the forts and inflicted heavy casualties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Koreans.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> peninsula.|$|E
5|$|While the 24th Infantry Division was {{fighting}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> western front, the 5th and 12th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced steadily {{on the eastern}} front. The North Korean army, 89,000men strong, had advanced into South Korea in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a complete rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and it was unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January, the KPA II Corps was {{decimated}} {{during its}} guerrilla operations, and its estimated strength was reduced from 16,000 to 8,000. The KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated strength was reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 {{by the end of}} January. In contrast, the UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period. The defeat of the North Korean army enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern front, and the retreating US Eighth Army <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> western front could finally return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured. As soon as the US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway immediately ordered the US Eighth Army to launch Operation Thunderbolt against Chinese and North Korean forces on January 25, 1951.|$|E

But <b>the</b> <b>Koreans</b> fought <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese {{soldiers}} were still unable to scale the walls even with heavy fire from arquebuses. <b>The</b> <b>Koreans</b> were not in a good position since Kim Si-min was wounded and the garrison was now running low on ammunition.|$|R

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Kinkaid became Commander Allied Naval Forces South West Pacific Area, and Commander of the Seventh Fleet, {{directing}} U.S. and Royal Australian Navy forces {{supporting the}} New Guinea campaign. During the Battle of the Surigao Strait he commanded the Allied {{ships in the}} last naval battle between battleships in history. Following the demise of Japanese naval power in the region, the Allied navies supported the campaigns in the Philippines and Borneo. Kinkaid was promoted to admiral on 3 April 1945. After the Pacific War ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in operations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> and China coasts. Admiral Kinkaid was Commander Eastern Sea Frontier and the Sixteenth Fleet from 1946 {{until his retirement in}} May 1950. He {{was a member of the}} National Security Training Commission for much of the rest of the decade. He also served with the American Battle Monuments Commission for 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{also contributed}} {{troops to the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. Volunteers for this force were {{recruited}} in late 1945, with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions: the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division, the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel. These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945. The brigade's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations, but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing {{the terms of the}} Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950.|$|E

5|$|The ferry {{scene was}} filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann's parents' house {{was located in}} Brooklyn (but was {{featured}} in the film in Boston). For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747, with transportation costs of $2 million, destroyed it into pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray's house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at the since dismantled Naugatuck Chemical. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning (the back of her character) with the portion showing {{the faces of the}} credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period Australia contributed significant {{forces to the}} Allied occupation of Japan {{as part of the}} British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling 13,500 personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949, and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948, forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> peninsula following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P-51 Mustangs, initially based at Bofu from March 1946, before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948. However, by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan. A total of ten RAN warships served in Japan during this period, including HMA Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, Arunta, Bataan, Culgoa, Murchison, Shoalhaven, Quadrant and Quiberon, while HMAS Ships Manoora, Westralia and Kanimbla also provided support.|$|E

5|$|Until 2003, US 113 {{continued}} {{north from}} Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing {{to the east}} of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic Barratt's Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the Puncheon Run Connector, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 {{on the south side of}} Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the Blue Hen Corporate Center, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the Dover Green Historic District and by the Delaware State Capitol, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).|$|E
5|$|With the People's Republic of China {{entering}} the Korean War in late 1950, the conflict had {{entered a new}} phase. To prevent North Korea from falling under United Nations (UN) control after the UN landing at Incheon, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) entered Korea and launched a series of surprise attacks against the UN forces near the Sino-Korean border {{at the end of}} 1950. The resulting battles at the Ch'ongch'on River Valley and the Chosin Reservoir forced the UN forces to retreat back to the 38th parallel by December 1950, with Chinese and North Korean forces recapturing much of North Korea. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> western front, after the United States Eighth Army suffered a disastrous defeat at the Ch'ongch'on River, the Eighth Army retreated back to the Imjin River while setting up defensive positions around the South Korean capital of Seoul. Although the US Eighth Army was ordered to hold Seoul for as long as possible, General Douglas MacArthur planned a series of withdrawals to the Pusan Perimeter under the assumption that UN forces were about to be overwhelmed in Korea. General Walton Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, was killed in a traffic accident on December 23, and Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway assumed command of the Eighth Army on December 26, 1950. At the UN, a ceasefire along the 38th parallel was proposed to China on December 11, 1950 in order to avoid any further escalation of hostility between China and the US.|$|E
