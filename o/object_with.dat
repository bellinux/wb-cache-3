V718 Persei is a star in the young open cluster IC 348 that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are twofold, namely first to present general criteria {{for the design of}} spatial data types that are necessary and valid for the modeling of spatial objects regardless whether we consider <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> sharp or undetermined boundaries, and second to show how the concepts of a type system for spatial <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> sharp boundaries can be suitably transferred and extended to the modeling of spatial <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> undetermined boundaries. The most relevant design criteria of such a type system comprise generality, closure properties, rigorous definition, finite resolution, numerical robustness, topological correctness, geometric consistency, extensibility and data model independence of spatial data types. The Realm/ROSE approach allows for these design criteria and offers an appropriate definition of a type system for spatial <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> sharp boundaries. An extension of the Realm/ROSE model is proposed that shows how general region <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> undetermined bound [...] ...|$|R

The results indicate that an average infant can categorize novel <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> a similar shape and a shared label starting at 16 months of age. Categorization of novel <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> a shared label but no perceptual similarity is at chance level at both ages.

5|$|The {{deflection}} {{of light}} by gravity {{is responsible for}} {{a new class of}} astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target <b>object</b> <b>with</b> appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational lensing. Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth. An <b>object</b> <b>with</b> the same diameter as Neptune has not been excluded by previous surveys. An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the outer Solar System and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E

40|$|To {{manipulate}} {{an object}} skillfully, the brain must learn its dynamics, specifying the mapping between applied force and motion. A fundamental issue in sensorimotor control is whether such dynamics {{are represented in}} an extrinsic frame of reference tied to the object or an intrinsic frame of reference linked to the arm. Although previous {{studies have suggested that}} objects are represented in arm-cen-tered coordinates [1 – 6], all of these studies have used <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> unusual and complex dynamics. Thus, it is not known how <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> natural dynamics are repre-sented. Here we show that <b>objects</b> <b>with</b> simple (or familiar) dynamics and those with complex (or unfamiliar) dynamics are represented in object- and arm-centered coordinates, respectively.

5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} <b>object</b> <b>with</b> a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an <b>object</b> <b>with</b> realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an <b>object</b> <b>with</b> a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E

5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae <b>object</b> (<b>with</b> a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player can find a character or <b>object</b> <b>with</b> a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested <b>object</b> <b>with</b> helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote <b>object</b> <b>with</b> a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E

Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity.
