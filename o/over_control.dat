5|$|Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio both cruised in {{the eastern}} Mediterranean after the war, and both were {{involved}} in postwar disputes <b>over</b> <b>control</b> of various cities. Caio Duilio was sent to provide {{a show of force}} during a dispute <b>over</b> <b>control</b> of İzmir in April 1919 and Andrea Doria assisted in the suppression of Gabriele D'Annunzio's seizure of Fiume in November 1920. Caio Duilio cruised the Black Sea after the İzmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by the battleship Giulio Cesare. Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were present during the Corfu incident in 1923 as part of the naval demonstration protesting the murder of General Enrico Tellini and four other Italians. In January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon, Portugal, to represent Italy during the celebration marking the 400th anniversary of the death of explorer Vasco da Gama. The two ships performed the normal routine of peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout the 1920s and early 1930s; both were placed in reserve in 1933.|$|E

5|$|By May 1940, Castle Bromwich {{had not yet}} {{built its}} first Spitfire, in spite of {{promises}} that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17 May, Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing <b>over</b> <b>control</b> of the Castle Bromwich plant to his Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave <b>over</b> <b>control</b> of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it would {{take some time to}} resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk IIs were built; 23 rolled out in July, 37 in August, and 56 in September. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs, and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. CBAF {{went on to become the}} largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type.|$|E

5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took <b>over</b> <b>control</b> of the castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall {{and other parts of}} the castle.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} laser {{radiation}} (Nd: YAG laser, 1064 nm at 800 mW, He–Ne laser 808 nm at 6 W, semiconductor laser 632. 8 nm at 40 mW) on growth and lipid accumulation of Chlorella pacifica were investigated in this study. The results showed growth rates increased 1. 23, 1. 41, and 1. 40 -fold <b>over</b> <b>controls</b> by 4 min Nd: YAG, 4 min He–Ne, and 8 min semiconductor laser treatments, respectively, whereas the corresponding nitrate reductase observed increased 1. 25, 1. 63, and 2. 08 -fold <b>over</b> <b>controls.</b> Moreover, total chlorophyll concentration was increased to 1. 09, 1. 29, and 1. 33 -fold <b>over</b> <b>controls,</b> respectively. After 20 days cultivation, the {{highest lipid content}} was 35. 99 %, 18. 46 %, and 31. 00 % after 2 min Nd: YAG, 4 min He–Ne, and 4 min semiconductor laser treatments, corresponding to 2. 86, 1. 50, and 2. 46 -fold increase <b>over</b> <b>controls,</b> respectively. Furthermore, the lipid productivity of the above 3 treatments were 15. 25 ± 2. 56, 16. 25 ± 2. 45, and 14. 75 ± 2. 11 mg L− 1 d− 1. However, the highest lipid productivity was 22. 00 ± 3. 28, 16. 25 ± 2. 45, and 19. 25 ± 1. 78 mg L− 1 d− 1, in response to treatment for 2 min Nd: YAG, 1 min He–Ne, and 4 min semiconductor laser treatments, with 2. 67, 1. 97, and 2. 33 -fold increase <b>over</b> <b>controls,</b> respectively. These results indicated that lipid accumulation efficiency of C. pacifica could be significantly improved by laser irradiation using Nd: YAG, He–Ne, and semiconductor laser treatments...|$|R
