5|$|The most {{significant}} predator of S.latus is the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus, although a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> species {{have also been}} reported to prey on S.latus, including dusky groupers (Epinephelus guaza), combers (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), red groupers (Epinephelus morio) and gag groupers (Mycteroperca microlepis). An Octopus vulgaris has been observed to eat S.latus in an artificial setting, but {{it is unclear whether}} S.latus is preyed on by octopuses in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cod is {{the common}} name for the genus Gadus of {{demersal}} fishes, belonging to the family Gadidae. Cod is also used {{as part of the}} common name for a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> species, and some species suggested to belong to genus Gadus are not called cod (the Alaska pollock).|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 38 known extant species of {{lampreys}}. Parasitic species {{are the best}} known, and feed by boring into the flesh <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> to suck their blood; but only 18 species of lampreys are parasitic. Parasitic lampreys also attach themselves to larger animals to get a free ride. Adults of the non-parasitic species do not feed; they live off reserves acquired as ammocoetes (larvae), which they obtain through filter feeding.|$|E
50|$|Stegophilines are {{sometimes}} considered candirú, so are considered parasites or semiparasites, {{because of their}} peculiar habit of feeding on scales, mucus, or skin <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This species {{once was}} {{regarded}} as a specialist, feeding on eyes <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes</b> (hence the common name eyebiter), (Winkler, 1966) but such behavior has never been observed in the wild.|$|R
30|$|Rainbow trout’s GATM {{was similar}} to the GATM <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes</b> (up to 90 % protein identity) and humans (80 % protein identity) but had fewer matches with the {{sequence}} of Belcher’s lancelet (Branchiostoma belcheri, 69 % protein identity). Compared with the sequences <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes,</b> trout’s GATM showed an insertion of one amino acid at position 39 (tyrosine). While the complete alignment showed an overall very high conservation, the sequences were quite diverse between position 30 and 65 of the alignment. The probability of export to mitochondria for trout’s GATM was calculated as 97 %.|$|R
25|$|Biologists {{have been}} trying to control {{lampreys}} in the lake since 1985 or earlier. Lampreys are native to the area but have expanded in population {{to such an extent that}} they wounded nearly all lake trout in 2006 and 70–80% of salmon. The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their casualties <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> to 35% of salmon and 31% of lake trout. The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of lake trout.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native fish {{can lead to}} the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with ruffe. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish,</b> for example roach, are only at risk for as little as three days.|$|E
25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish.</b> It {{has been linked to}} declines and localised extirpations of several small native fish species. The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E
50|$|Plecodus multidentatus is {{a species}} of cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is a scale-eater, eating the scales off <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes.</b> This species can reach a length of 12 cm TL.|$|R

500|$|The term [...] "fish" [...] most {{precisely}} describes any non-tetrapod craniate (i.e. {{an animal}} with a skull {{and in most}} cases a backbone) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins. Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa, including hagfishes, lampreys, sharks and rays, ray-finned fish, coelacanths, and lungfish. Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of tetrapods (such as mammals, birds, amphibians, etc.) than <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> such as ray-finned fish or sharks, so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology, {{the use of the term}} [...] "fish" [...] as a biological group must be avoided.|$|E
500|$|In February 2001, the Niles Report {{proposed}} an additional four {{modifications to the}} causeway project: to either replace the fishway, open the gates during peak fish migration, open the gates permanently, or replace the entire causeway with a bridge. An Environmental Impact Assessment study was commissioned in 2003 to develop and summarise these options, and on its completion in 2005, it announced the recognition of [...] "Option 3" [...] and [...] "Option 4" [...] as possible solutions. The first option had been ruled out following the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish</b> passage models, which were deemed inapplicable to the river. The second, suggesting systematic gate-opening periods, was ruled out because of the inability to cater to every marine species' migration periods. Option 4 was split into three sub-options, mainly to list possible bridge lengths: 170, 280, and 315metres (190, 310, and 344yards). The provincial government later accepted the proposal on 6 December 2006, and selected [...] "Option 4B" [...] on 7 August 2007, which called for a [...] bridge {{in the place of}} the causeway.|$|E
500|$|Rainbow trout are predators with {{a varied}} diet and will eat nearly {{anything}} they can capture. They are not as piscivorous or aggressive as brown trout or chars. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic diptera). [...] They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, crayfish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become planktonic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish.</b> [...] Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, squid and amphipods.|$|E

5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fishes.</b> The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|R
50|$|The One-and-a-half-stripe Hap (Protomelas insignis) is {{a species}} of cichlid endemic to Lake Malawi where it prefers rocky areas.

2500|$|Steelhead {{are raised}} in many {{countries}} throughout the world. Since the 1950s production has grown exponentially, particularly in Europe and recently in Chile. Worldwide, in 2007, 604,695 tonnes of farmed Steelhead were harvested with a value of $2.59 billion. The largest producer is Chile. In Chile and Norway, the ocean cage production of steelhead has expanded to supply export markets. Inland production of rainbow trout to supply domestic markets has increased strongly {{in countries such as}} Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, and Spain. Other significant producing countries include the United States, Iran, Germany, and the UK.

60|$|Peterkin stopped one instant to {{obey the}} command, and then plied his paddle again with all his might. No sooner had the fish fallen on the water than we {{observed}} the shark to sink. In another second we saw its white breast rising; for sharks always turn over on their sides when about to seize their prey, their mouths being not {{at the point of}} their heads like those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>fish,</b> but, as it were, under their chins. In another moment his snout rose above the water; his wide jaws, armed with a terrific double row of teeth, appeared; the dead fish was engulfed, and the shark sank out of sight. But Jack was mistaken in supposing that it would be satisfied. In a very few minutes it returned to us, and its quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.|$|E
