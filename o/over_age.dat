5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI {{is more common in}} young people, its costs to society are high due to the loss of productive years to death and disability. The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults <b>over</b> <b>age</b> 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people <b>over</b> <b>age</b> 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (<b>over</b> <b>age</b> 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen <b>over</b> <b>age</b> 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E

40|$|New {{models for}} {{modeling}} the material properties for aluminium alloys {{that can take}} into consideration the geometry of the needle shaped precipitates, that can be found in 6 xxx alloys are being developed. The background for this thesis is to help find needed experimental data to calibrate and develop these model further. In this thesis the chosen material to study was from an extruded plate of AA 6082 aluminium, which is a relevant material in for example the automobile industry. Three different tempered cases has been studied in depth with Transmission Electron Microscopy, tensile tests and hardness curves. A hardness curve was made to find T 6 which is the first case. The second case was weakly <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> at 185 ◦C after reaching T 6 until it reached ≈ 70 % of peak hardness. The third case was <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> at 200 ◦C after reaching T 6 until it also reached ≈ 70 % peak hardness. It has been made cross section area and length distributions of the precipitates for the three cases using a TEM. The tensile tests were done to relate the contributions of the different particle parameters such as length, cross section area and density to the mechanical properties of the material. It was found in the tensile tests that the <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> materials experienced increased initial work hardening rate as compared to T 6. The distributions showed that the material <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> at 200 ◦C had wider and shorter precipitates compared to the material <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> at 185 ◦C. It was also found that the <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> materials has a significantly lower particle density compared to T 6...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe microstructure, {{mechanical}} properties and fracture behavior of an as-received QE 22 alloy {{have been investigated}} under different thermal conditions, including solution treated (ST), under aged (UA), peak <b>aged</b> (PA) and <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> (OA) conditions. A significant increase in hardness of 27 %, yield strength of 60 % and ultimate tensile strength of 19 % was observed in peak aged sample as compared to solution treated sample. The improvements of mechanical strength properties are mainly associated with the metastable λ and β′ precipitates. Grain growth was not observed in the ST samples after subjecting to UA and PA treatments due {{to the presence of}} eutectic Mg 12 Nd particles along the grain boundaries. In <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> sample, significant grain growth occurred because of dissolution of eutectic phase particles. Different natures of crack initiation and propagation were observed under different thermal conditions during tensile testing at room temperature. The mode of failure of solution treated sample is transgranular, cleavage and twin boundary fractures. A mixed mode of transgranular, intergranular, cleavage and twin boundary failure is observed in both peak <b>aged</b> and <b>over</b> <b>aged</b> samples...|$|R
