The setting up <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> is apprehended through the website {{and the type of}} strategy through the functionalities available on the Internet. Thus we distinguish <b>an</b> information-oriented <b>strategy</b> from <b>a</b> commercially oriented one. Probit analyses and models derived from count data models are conducted on <b>a</b> dataset <b>of</b> website investments by about 1100 firms located in Luxembourg. Our results show that the sale of online fashionable products like tourism, the ownership <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-known brand and the follow-up of rivals' behaviours are highly significant determinants of the adoption and development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> e-business <b>strategy.</b> Financial, human and technological resources seem to favour the adoption <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> but have no significant influence on the choice of the strategy pursued. Moreover the use of technologies that make the business process more flexible, public actions that diffuse best practices concerning technologies adoption and being the leader on the market are specific drivers of the deployment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> e-business <b>strategy.</b> Finally, <b>an</b> intense perceived competition negatively influences the decision to invest heavily in e-commerce. ...|$|R

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper uses {{experimental}} data {{to examine the}} existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teaching <b>strategy</b> among boundedly rational players. If players realize that their own actions modify their opponents' beliefs and actions, they might play certain actions to this specific end and forego immedi- ate payoffs if the expected payoff gain from <b>a</b> teaching <b>strategy</b> is high enough. Our results support the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teaching <b>strategy</b> in several ways. After exhibiting some regular- ities consistent with teaching, we examine more precisely the existence <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>strategy.</b> First we show that players update their beliefs {{in order to take}} account of the reaction of their opponents to their own action. Second, we examine whether players actually use <b>a</b> teaching <b>strategy</b> by playing <b>an</b> action that induces a poor immediate payoff but is likely to modify the opponent's behavior so that a preferable outcome might emerge in the future. We find strong evidence <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> in the data and confirm this finding within a logistic model that suggests that the future expected payoff that could arise from <b>a</b> teach- ing <b>strategy</b> has indeed <b>a</b> significant impact on choice probabilities. Finally, we investigate the effective impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teaching <b>strategy</b> on achieved outcomes and find that more tena- cious teachers can successfully use such <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> in order to reach their favorite outcome at the expense of their opponents...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a topological game GΠ involving two players α and β and show that, for a paratopological group, the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning <b>strategy</b> for player β implies {{the group is}} a topological one. We provide <b>a</b> large class <b>of</b> topological spaces X for which the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning <b>strategy</b> for player β {{is equivalent to the}} requirement that X is a Baire space. This allows to extend the class of paratopological or semitopological groups for which one can prove that they are, actually, topological groups. Conditions of the type “existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning <b>strategy</b> for the player α” or “absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning <b>strategy</b> for the player β” are frequently used in mathematics. Though convenient and satisfactory for theoretical considerations, such conditions do not reveal much about the internal structure of the topological space where they hold. We show that the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> winning <b>strategy</b> for any of the players in all games of Banach–Mazur type can be expressed in terms of “saturated sieves” of open sets...|$|R

The Germans had maintained a continuous front but only by using reserves which made it impossible to begin the counter-offensive planned by , which made the offensive a considerable Allied success, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> of attrition based on organised fire power. Looked on as an attempt to break through and force the Germans out of Caen the operation failed but in terms of Montgomery's strategy it was a costly victory. The German defence of Normandy never recovered from the damage inflicted during Epsom, the initiative was lost and German counter-attack tactics failed in the face of Allied fire power, with even greater cost than that inflicted on the British; the German command structure and assumptions on which the defence was based were undermined.|$|E
5|$|Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose {{literary}} works included plays and poetry {{as well as}} opera libretti; Monteverdi had first met him in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title La finta pazza Licori. Feigned madness was a standard theme in the commedia dell'arte tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends to be mad, all as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> to win the heart of her lover, Aminta.|$|E
