40|$|I love food. I love cooking, baking, testing, and eating. I {{read about}} food preparation, food facts, and food service. Over the years I’ve {{developed}} my {{fair share of}} knowledge about cooking and I’m a decent cook, but I’m no chef. I guess I’m what you’d call a “foodie”. However, I have {{the good fortune to}} have a friend who is a chef and owns one of the best, and certainly the most innovative, restaurants in town. During this summer I hosted a cooking class in my home for my family with my chef friend as instructor. The Tex-Mex barbecue theme was a big hit (you can contact me for recipes, if you like), but much more fascinating was the explanation of the science behind the cooking. It turns out that there is a term for this: molecular gastronomy. Another term, and hence the genesis of my “Eureka!” moment of the summer, is evidence based cooking. Good cooking is not just following a recipe (not all of which are evidence based) but at its best is the culmination of heaps of tested information regarding why and how chemical and environmental factors work together to result in a gastronomical delight. For example, will brining or marinating a pork chop make it moister? And, if brining, what temperature should the water be, how long should it soak, and how much salt is needed? Why does pounding meat increase its tenderness? What will keep guacamole from browning better – the pit or lime juice? What does baking soda do in a chocolate cake? Eggs or no eggs in fresh pasta? Like most librarians, I tend not to take information at face value. I want to know where information comes from and {{whether or not it is}} valid, based on specific factors. I’ve come to notice that evidence based, or evidence informed, practice is everywhere and has a tremendous impact on our lives. Why do you rotate the tires <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>car?</b> Evidence shows that the front tires wear more quickly (think about all those 3 -pointturns, the braking, etc) and therefore, switching the front tires with the back tires will increase the life span of the tires. Ergonomics is based heavily on human factors research and usability testing; theme park design is largely affected by studies onthe psychology of waiting; the study of local weather patterns and temperatures directly affects landscape architecture; advertising is strategically designed and presented based upon sociological studies such as demographics and viewing/reading behaviour. Could one argue that natural evolution is a result of nature’s long-term evidence-based practice? I know that I’m not alone in finding this fascinating, especially since the basis of these studies is information. While my own work may focus more on medical and health information, I feel that as an information specialist I can take pride in the fact that the soul of my field, information, is essential to the world around me. Think about this when you feel yourself getting cynical about research and the validity of your profession (don’t tell me you’ve never been there). I will be the first to admit that evidence is not always the be-all and end-all. There is a lot to be said for spontaneity (i. e. Hmmmm… I wonder if a sprig of fresh thyme would taste good in the mushroom sauce?”) and happenstance (i. e. “Well, whaddaya know [...] . penicillin!”). I certainly don’t think that every decision needs to be researched. But thank goodness for many research based decisions, without which the world would be a very different place and, heaven forbid, the perfect crème brulée may not exist...|$|E

40|$|Jock Given {{looks at}} the good and bad reasons why the {{decision}} has taken so long AUSTRALIAN radio is going digital. Communications Minister Helen Coonan announced the decision at commercial radio’s recent annual conference. If you think you’ve heard this before, you’re right. Seven years ago, minister Richard Alston announced the same thing. ‘Digital Radio Services Available by 2001 ’, declared a media release that has disappeared from the departmental website. There are good reasons and bad reasons Australia still has no digital radio services ten years after they became available in Britain. First, the good. Digital technology is everywhere, {{but it has not}} been absolutely clear how the benefits of using it to transmit radio would justify the cost. Radio broadcasters have to put in new transmitters, and radio audiences have to buy new receivers. Most people have more than one radio, and many have several. It is like the introduction of FM. You’ll still be able to receive the existing AM and FM stations, but you’ll need a digital receiver to listen to the new ones. The sound quality should be better, there’ll be more stations overall, and the receivers will have additional features. But none of these benefits is unqualified. The improvement in sound quality will depend on the technology chosen and the way individual broadcasters use it. Many listeners in normal listening environments won’t notice a huge difference. Certainly, few will get the kind of enhancement every AM listener notices when they switch to decent FM. The number of extra stations depends on how much spectrum is made available and how the government allocates it. The frequencies allotted in the government’s announcement aren’t sufficient even for all existing radio stations to move to digital. And in any case, Australians have already received a lot more analogue radio over the last decade - around 100 new commercial stations, nearly 200 non-profit community stations and over 250 special interest ‘narrowcasting’ services. As well, around 450 new transmitters have enabled the ABC and SBS to establish new networks and greatly expand the reach of existing ones. Many of the promised additional features of digital radio seem just plain dumb. A screen for your radio? It’s called television. Reading scrolling text <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> radio? You’ll crash. Rewind live radio? Perhaps. So the scepticism of radio broadcasters has been understandable. Many commercial operators have been too busy starting new analogue FM stations, or dealing with additional competitors, to worry about an expensive technology with uncertain potential. The national broadcasters beg for money as it is. Community radio was built on the twin features of FM - high-quality sound, but cheap to establish and operate. Most stations can’t even dream of the cash required to upgrade to digital. But there have been bad reasons as well. New technology is always a risk. It doesn’t just happen. Someone has to make it happen - even when it is as apparently ‘inevitable’ as digital. Commercial radio has wanted to ensure digital radio is not introduced the way FM was in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Then, new players got the licences to use the better technology. With smart programming strategies, they quickly dominated their markets. The commercial industry has also hoped to avoid an auction for the frequencies it wants to use for digital services. That’s how many AM stations had to get hold of an FM frequency, either to convert their AM station, or to acquire a second licence, once the ownership rules were changed to allow it. Just like the free-to-air television industry, commercial radio operators argued digital transmission is something the whole industry needs to adopt. Spectrum needs to be put into their ‘safe and experienced hands’, at no extra charge, so this can happen. Wisely, the government has rejected the idea of ‘digital conversion’. It thinks digital radio services will supplement and complement analogue AM and FM, not wholly replace them. Perversely, however, the government has given the commercial industry much of what it wants anyway. It gets most of the spectrum at no extra charge. It gets a guarantee that no new commercial radio services will be allocated in the frequency bands mainly used by broadcasters for six years after the commencement of the first digital services. This is not a total shut-out for new digital entrants, but it is {{for those who want to}} use the main broadcast frequency bands. Commercial radio knows this game well. In its early years, the 1920 s and 1930 s, around 100 licences were granted. Over the next 35 years, just 18 more were issued. The industry convinced the Menzies Government to introduce radio to new towns by increasing the transmission power of established stations, rather than setting up new ones. The disruptive potential of FM was resisted for decades. What this policy doesn’t say is at least as important as what it does. It doesn’t say when digital services will start. It wants them ‘as soon as practicable’, but because the moratorium on new licences doesn’t commence until the new services do, there’s an incentive to dawdle. It doesn’t say whether the ABC and SBS will get any money for digital services. In Britain, the BBC’s extra cash has been crucial to the rapid roll-out of services and the availability of new stations. And for places outside the state capital cities, even those as big as Newcastle, Wollongong and Canberra, the policy is wait and see. The government says only that it will urge broadcasters to commence trials. There’s no sign that the seven years since the government first announced the arrival of digital radio has been used to think broadly about the future of radio, or about how the specific attributes of digital transmission technology might be best used to deliver a broader range of original programming to audiences. The new policy is not so much a plan for introducing digital radio, as a plan to ensure no one except incumbent stations introduces digital radio using the best frequencies in the biggest markets in the foreseeable future. If you live outside the capital cities and want new digital audio choices faster than that, move to London or get an iPod. • Jock Given is the author of Turning off the Television: Broadcasting’s Uncertain Future.
