30|$|We {{see that}} macro UEs {{can benefit from}} {{femtocell}} cooperation {{in cases where the}} wireless backhaul is supported by <b>outdoor</b> <b>antennas.</b> When no <b>outdoor</b> <b>antennas</b> are available, data rate sees almost no improvement due to the low transmit power of the femtocell and the penetration loss. On the other hand, when <b>outdoor</b> <b>antennas</b> are added to the network, we see significant improvement even for percentages below 50 %. In the low percentage range, we observe that data rate increases between 1.3 and 5.5 % for 30 % femtocell availability, while for 40 % femtocell availability, we see an increase of 1.8 to 6.7 % compared to the case of only direct transmission in the uplink. Again, the above percentages are relative improvement compared to the reference case of the classic femtocells without wireless backhaul.|$|R

25|$|In {{an analog}} world, {{operations}} on VHF channels (those between 2 and 13) could operate at power levels {{significantly lower than}} UHF stations (saving electricity costs), and still cover greater areas. The All-Channel Receiver Act of 1961 guaranteed that all new TV's must be designed to receive UHF channels, but the major networks were already well established. For digital transmissions VHF channels are very noisy in particular Low-VHF (channels 2-6). It is difficult to receive the signals without the standardized 30' <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna.</b> Fewer than 40 full power stations in the USA are using Low-VHF channels since the mandatory digital conversion in 2009, and major network affiliates are mostly in large sparsely populated direct marketing areas where outdoor antennas are common. In contrast to the USA, the United Kingdom completely abandoned VHF channels for television when they went all digital.|$|E
25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna</b> became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{original}} WTIC-TV (channel 3, now WFSB) signed on from Hartford in September 1957, WNHC-TV {{was the only}} station on the VHF dial in Connecticut.

5000|$|Antennas are {{a common}} source of weak signals. An <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna</b> is often {{connected}} to its receiver by a transmission line called a [...] "feed line".

5000|$|A {{television}} antenna, or TV aerial, is {{an antenna}} {{specifically designed for}} the reception of over-the-air broadcast television signals, which are transmitted at frequencies from about 41 to 250 MHz in the VHF band, and 470 to 960 MHz in the UHF band in different countries. Television antennas are manufactured in two different types: [...] "indoor" [...] antennas, to be located on top of or next to the television set, and [...] "outdoor" [...] antennas, mounted on a mast {{on top of the}} owner's house. They can also be mounted in a loft or attic, where the dry conditions and increased elevation are advantageous for reception and <b>antenna</b> longevity. <b>Outdoor</b> <b>antennas</b> are more expensive and difficult to install, but are necessary for adequate reception in fringe areas far from television stations. The most common types of indoor antennas are the dipole ("rabbit ears") and loop <b>antennas,</b> and for <b>outdoor</b> <b>antennas</b> the yagi, log periodic, and for UHF channels the multi-bay reflective array antenna.|$|R
50|$|While an <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{required}} for adequate digital reception in most locations beyond 10 - 25 mi from TV transmitters, and smart antenna interfaces were an optionally permitted feature of coupon-eligible converter boxes, there were no subsidies for antennas. Although manufacturers could sell a converter/smart-antenna bundle, {{they were required to}} also offer the converter by itself to consumers.|$|E
50|$|The 23-centimeter band (1240-1300 MHz) is {{the third}} highest {{frequency}} band available for ATV. Analog big-dish satellite television (TVRO) receivers may be re-purposed for inexpensively receiving ATV in this band. Such receivers can decode FM television when an <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is connected to the}} LNB input. Due to the low cost and ease of repurposing old analog satellite receivers, this is the most popular band for FM amateur TV.|$|E
50|$|Although not by strict {{definition}} terrestrial TV DX, satellite UHF TVRO reception {{is related}} in certain aspects. For example, reception of satellite signals requires sensitive receiving systems and large <b>outdoor</b> <b>antenna</b> systems. However, unlike terrestrial TV DX, satellite UHF TV reception is {{far easier to}} predict. The geosynchronous satellite at 22375 mi height is a line of sight reception source. If the satellite is above the horizon, it can be generally received, if it is below the horizon, reception is not possible.|$|E
