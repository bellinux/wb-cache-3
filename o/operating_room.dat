40|$|Abstract—With {{the aim of}} rationalization, {{resources}} optimization {{and service}} quality improvement, Moroccan hospitals are improving their management strategy, especially in the <b>operating</b> <b>rooms.</b> Budget cuts and {{the increasing number of}} patients of the <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> services are the major constraints of reasonable hospital management. Those <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> responsible are in charge of searching for a way to respond optimally to these needs. Therefore, it is undeniable that the optimization of the allocated expenses and resources of these rooms has become a necessity. In the present work we model <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> using the object approach with UML. A study of a real case of the National Institute of Oncology (NIO) is presented to elucidate the functional, static and dynamic aspects. Subsequently, we present the results of performance of <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> modeled using the simulation softwar...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of various schedules for <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> are determined by the use of a Simscript simulation program. Input variables consist of actual data or are generated from their probability distributions by the Monte Carlo technique. The simulator assigns <b>operating</b> <b>rooms,</b> anesthetists, and nurses for each case when they are available. A report of the performance of the system, which may be obtained at any desired periodic cycle, includes idle time and waiting time for facilities and personnel. The simulator, applied here to a suite of <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> in a specialty hospital for elective surgery, can, with minor modifications, be used to describe a general system of <b>operating</b> <b>rooms...</b>|$|R
5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E

Dismayed with the merger, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) condemns the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for initiating it, only to be yelled at. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is optimistic, assuring everyone that they will keep their jobs. A patient, Jodie Crawley (Adrienne Barbeau), and her son with schizophrenia, Tom (James Frain), is brought into {{the hospital with a}} moving growth inside her stomach, claimed to be an alien by her son.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{considered}} data {{of samples}} {{collected in the}} period 1994 - 2001 in 83 <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> of 13 different public and private hospitals in Veneto Region. The anaestetic gases more used in <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> were nitrous oxide, isoflurane and, more recently, sevflurane. The mostly polluted positions were those in proximity of anaesthesiologic devices; the gases average concentrations were low in all hospitals examined, although some <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> demonstrated concentrations of anasthetic gases exceeding limit values. Lastly, the professional figures had different exposure to the various anaesthetic gases...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ventilation}} on airborne contamination was studied {{in a new}} operating suite containing <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> with conventional ventilation (17 - 20 turnovers/h) and <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> with zonal ventilation, where the turnover in {{the central part of}} the room was ∼ 80 /h. The efficacy of the ventilation was first examined with gas tracer experiments and found satisfactory. Experiments using potassium iodide particles showed the transfer between adjacent rooms in the suite to be less than 10 - 3 % with closed doors and from 1 % to 2 · 5 × 10 - 2 % when the doors were opened once a minute. The transfer between two adjacent <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> was calculated to be ∼ 10 - 4 %. There is thus little risk of spread of airborne infection between <b>operating</b> <b>rooms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} in industrial clean rooms was compared quantitatively and qualitatively {{with that of}} hospital <b>operating</b> <b>rooms.</b> The number of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms which accumulated on stainless-steel strips exposed for periods up to 21 weeks to the intramural air of four <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> was at least 1 log higher than the accumulation on strips exposed in four clean rooms, and was {{essentially the same as}} that found in two factory areas. Volumetric air samplings showed that there were significantly higher numbers of airborne viable particles per cubic foot of air in <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> than in industrial clean rooms. In contrast to clean rooms, where most of the airborne contaminants were those associated with human hair, skin, and respiratory tract, the hospital <b>operating</b> <b>rooms</b> showed a very high level of microorganisms associated with dust and soil...|$|R
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) {{performing}} a special surgery, {{and to her}} dismay, the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), {{over whether or not}} he should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage in the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E
5|$|When Torres again {{goes into}} cardiac arrest, Montgomery {{delivers}} her daughter at twenty-three weeks's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in {{and is able}} to revive her. Across the <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister (and series main character) Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, primary series star) confesses that she was jealous of Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood.

5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the <b>operating</b> <b>room.</b> In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her {{superiors}} at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an image that looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing {{the skin of his}} face and performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Halloween (1978), co-written {{and directed}} by John Carpenter, {{tells the story of}} Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael (Will Sandin) killing his teenage sister Judith (Sandy Johnson) on Halloween 1963 in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is subsequently hospitalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael (Nick Castle and Tony Moran) escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends as they babysit. The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Halloween II (1981) picks up where the events of Halloween left off. Michael's body is missing from the front lawn, where he fell when Loomis shot him. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital, killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie. The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael's sister: she was given up for adoption as an infant. Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an <b>operating</b> <b>room,</b> where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room toward Laurie before finally falling dead.|$|E

5|$|Torres {{goes into}} cardiac arrest and is taken into an <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> she is {{temporarily}} stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter {{in case the}} baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.|$|E
5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the <b>operating</b> <b>room</b> with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.|$|E

40|$|Recovery {{energy of}} the exhaust in air {{conditioning}} {{is very important to}} clean <b>operating</b> <b>rooms.</b> In disinfected <b>operating</b> <b>rooms,</b> we often use completely fresh air conditioning system in order to maintain cleanliness. All the return air of the air conditioning must be discharged. For recovering the exhaust energy, whole heat exchangers are used, and they may bring cross-infection in clean <b>operating</b> <b>rooms.</b> Cross-infection would negatively affect cleanness. This paper puts forward an air layer inside of a building's external wall that acts as a passageway for air conditioning exhaust, and also providing a place for the thermal exchange of the air conditioning exhaust. This kind of envelope is named an interlayer ventilation wall. There are two advantages. First, it will recover and reutilize the energy that the air conditioning exhaust takes, avoid cross-infection between the fresh air and the exhaust. Second, it will lower the energy loss of the heat exchange through the envelope. The energy saving effect will be very significant in clean <b>operating</b> <b>rooms...</b>|$|R
