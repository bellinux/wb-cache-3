The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, {{a legitimate}} expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The doctrine <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often {{prevents the}} public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectation originates from {{common law}} principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do was to identify what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E

5|$|The Underground State {{achieved}} its zenith {{of influence}} in early 1944. In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate's Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration. This was when the Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers at Home (Krajowa Rada Ministrów, KRM) was created. The Underground State however declined sharply {{in the aftermath of}} the nationwide uprising, Operation Tempest, initiated in the Spring of 1944. In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful Warsaw Uprising part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the Soviet Union and its puppet Polish government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous. The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> hosts. Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground's military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead. In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves.|$|E
5|$|The desecration of the {{two most}} sacred sites of Merina royalty {{represented}} a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power. In the popular view, the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors (Andrianampoinimerina in particular) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and deviance from ancestral tradition. Believing that the presence of the ancestors within the tombs sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built, Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt {{from the base of the}} tombs to carry with them in their offensives against the French; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns' bodies from the tombs to undermine the fighters' confidence and solidarity. Although the tombs were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated, Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character. The royal tombs were reconstructed in 2008 by the government of Madagascar under the Ravalomanana administration. During the 1995 fire that destroyed the tombs and other structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the lamba-wrapped remains of only one sovereign—Ranavalona III—could be saved from the flames. The queen has since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectation {{has been viewed}} as an offshoot of natural justice. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectations. In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, fairness, and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection <b>of</b> <b>legitimate</b> expectations.|$|E
