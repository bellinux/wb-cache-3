Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them.

Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E

500|$|Writing in the {{academic}} journal Rhizomes, scholar Martin Hall, while analyzing the movie, discusses the self-perception an individual develops based on the views of those outside of themselves. The academician notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror, they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self-contained, and learn partly they are what they see in the mirror. He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs' vision of his future self. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Anderton shows little concern for the precogs; when Witwer feels pity for them, he responds: [...] "It's better if you don't think of them as human." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, Anderton is shown in tears at his home, high on the hard drug neuroin while mourning the loss of his son. Agatha enters a similar period of self-examination when she has visions of her mother's death, and is informed they are merely [...] "echoes" [...] i.e. a faulty image in her memory. Anderton becomes flustered when he begins to interpret the images which show him about to commit murder and begins to frantically sort through, According to Hall he begins [...] "searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that represents him as a murderer." [...] Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly, as he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood, they will not show him to be the murderer, because he is convinced that he is not a murderer. He literally becomes obsessed with himself, seeking to resolve these images with put him at [...] "discordance with his own reality." [...] Previously, at peace with himself, Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs' visions. Unable to reconcile the two, Hall says that he is forced to decide that [...] "it is likely that errors have occurred" [...] in the PreCrime system.|$|E
