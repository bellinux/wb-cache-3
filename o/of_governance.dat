40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) In recent years, {{academic}} {{interest in}} the role <b>of</b> corporate <b>governance</b> has increased considerably due to its importance in the institutional and policy framework for companies. Due to the special roles of banks in every country’s financial system, a special study <b>of</b> corporate <b>governance</b> is even more relevant for the banking industry. Since Hong Kong is an important international financial centre, thorough study <b>of</b> the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> its banking sector has particular significance for the Hong Kong business setting, the international business environment in general and academe. Oddly enough, despite such importance in all business settings, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> banks in general, and in particular, to the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> banks in Hong Kong. To narrow this gap between the importance <b>of</b> corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> banks in Hong Kong and the studies undertaken, this research overviews and analyses the effectiveness <b>of</b> corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> the banks listed in Hong Kong. Both archival research and survey research are undertaken to test the effectiveness <b>of</b> the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> listed banks in Hong Kong. The results of those enquiries reveal that Hong Kong listed banks generally separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, engage in good internal control and risk management processes, and exercise good investor protection - as corroborated by their low cost of funding. Overall the research results confirm that listed banks in Hong Kong have high level <b>of</b> corporate <b>governance,</b> which explains the success of Hong Kong as an important international financial centre...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle {{and what can be}} termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method <b>of</b> <b>governance</b> rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged {{as a result of the}} pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E
