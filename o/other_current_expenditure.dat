Using the most convenient techniques, a restrictive set of four expenditures (subsidies, interest payments, <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and total public expenditures as a proportion of GDP) was found among the wider set suggested by the Literature. The nature of these expenditures supports the claim that, for the Portuguese case, a particular validity of the compensation hypothesis has been observed.

Internal R&D is the main input and driver of the innovation process, but innovation involves other activities, including capital purchases and <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditures.</b> While the R&D activities of energy firms have been analysed, {{few studies have examined}} the typology of their innovation activities. Here, we analyse the impact of the main characteristics of the sector’s firms on their decisions to invest in each of three types of innovation activity: namely internal R&D; external R&D; and, the acquisition of advanced machinery, equipment or software. In conducting this analysis, we take the potential persistence of innovation activities into account. We also examine the role that different innovation objectives have on firms’ investment decisions. Given that engagement in a specific type of innovation may result from decisions that are not taken independently of each other, we analyse whether there is any complementarity between the three innovation activities. In carrying out the empirical analysis, we draw on data for private energy firms included in the Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC) for Spanish firms for the period 2004 - 2013.

The Business Expenditure on Research and Development is an annual survey whose main purpose is to supply data for policy purposes on Science and Technology, of which Research and Development is an important part. It uniquely provides information on total Research and Development expenditure in the UK by business enterprises, total Research and Development employment and sources of funds. Data are used {{on a regular basis}} by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT) for international comparisons in their publications. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research. For the fifth edition (April 2016) all data files have been replaced and updated to include real postcodes for every year (previously pseudo-anonymised postcodes prior to 2009). This edition also includes the addition of the ' 2013 revised' and ' 2014 provisional' data files. Main Topics : The Reporting Units surveyed receive either a 'long form' or 'short form'. The long form asks for information on: in-house expenditure on Research and Development: broken down by product group and purpose (civil or defence) broken down by funding sources: central government; private industry and public corporations; overseas EC programmes; overseas; own funds; <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> broken down by basic research; applied research; and experimental research capital expenditure broken down by land and buildings; and plant and machinery Research and Development commissioned outside the company number of employees working on Research and Development broken down by scientists and engineers; technicians; others Smaller firms receive a short form. This only asks for a breakdown of Research and Development by civil and defence for three questions. It requests aggregate figures for Intramural Research and Development (including both current and capital expenditure), purchasing of Research and Development (work conducted outside the company, funded by the business) and average employment on Research and Development (number of full time equivalents). Figures are constructed for those that filled in the short form to cover all the variables covered by the long form. For certain variables, values are imputed from third party sources or estimated rather than returned by respondents. All the un-sampled firms have figures imputed for the entire variable list...|$|E
40|$|A presente dissertação concentra-se nos aspectos fiscais, financeiros, econômicos e sociais do Estado de Pernambuco, com foco nas ações da Administração Pública inerentes ao desenvolvimento local. O propósito foi analisar a relação existente entre os gastos do governo estadual e os principais índices econômicos e sociais – PIB, PIB Per Capita, IDH e GINI. A pesquisa iniciou-se com uma análise sobre a evolução do conceito de desenvolvimento, trazendo-o a uma abordagem contemporânea, onde se identificou, à luz do paradigma da complexidade e do critério de justiça social, que o termo desenvolvimento representa mais do que o simples crescimento econômico, abarcando as melhorias sociais da população. O procedimento metodológico {{principal}} consistiu da agregação das despesas públicas não-financeiras, realizadas no período de 1991 até 2005, por natureza e por função, que foram comparadas estatisticamente, através das técnicas de correlação e regressão, com os índices econômicos e sociais do estado de Pernambuco. Observou-se a existência de correlação positiva e significante entre os indicadores econômicos e sociais do Estado e as despesas públicas, classificadas por grupo de despesa e agrupamento por função. Para os indicadores econômicos, destacaram-se: Educação, Previdência Social, Segurança Pública, Trabalho e Pessoal e Encargos. Com relação ao IDH, destacaram-se Outras Despesas Correntes, Pessoal e Encargos Sociais, Segurança Pública e Previdência Social. O índice de GINI não apresentou correlação significativa e os modelos de regressão foram invalidados por problemas de ajustamento. Acredita-se que este trabalho significou mais um passo na busca pelo melhor conceito de desenvolvimento da sociedade; bem como, que contribuiu para demonstrar a possibilidade da utilização de métodos quantitativos, aliado a informações contábeis, econômicas e sociais, na análise da efetividade dos gastos públicos, buscando fornecer aos gestores e a sociedade em geral diretrizes eficazes e úteis na aplicação dos recursos públicos. This dissertation {{focuses on}} fiscal aspects, financial, {{economic and social}} State of Pernambuco, with focus on {{the actions of the}} public administration involved in local development. The purpose was to analyze the relationship between State Government spending and the main economic and social indices-GDP, per Capita GDP, HDI and GINI. The search began with an analysis of the evolution of the concept of development, bringing it to a contemporary approach, where identified, {{in the light of the}} paradigm of complexity and the criterion of social justice, that the term development represents more than simple economic growth, embracing the social improvements of the population. A theoretical framework was drawn up soon after, focusing on the role of the State in development, the evolution of thought political-economic regional, regional disparities in Brazil, the dynamics of the State of Pernambuco and the fiscal transfers in the Brazilian Federation. The main methodological procedure consisted of aggregation of non-financial, public expenditure made during the period from 1991 until 2005, by nature and by function, which were compared statistically through the techniques of correlation and regression, with the social and economic indices of the State of Pernambuco. A large part of the accounting data was extracted and treated in the General Accounting of the State, due to the fact that during this period were not reflected in the database, and the form of classification has been changed in several financial years. The economic and social indicators were obtained in the Department of information disclosure of IBGE, UNDP consultancy area and site of the IPEA. It was observed the existence of significant and positive correlation between economic and social indicators of the State and public spending, classified by expenditure group and group functions. For economic indicators, were: education, Social Security, public safety, work and personal charges. With respect to the HDI, stood out <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditure,</b> personnel and social charges, public security and Social Security. The GINI index has not presented significant correlation and regression models were invalidated by adjustment problems. It is believed that this meant another step in the search for the best concept of development of society; as well, which contributed to demonstrate the possibility of the use of quantitative methods, coupled with accounting information, economic and social, in the analysis of the effectiveness of public spending, seeking to provide managers and society in General effective guidelines for the application of resources...|$|E
40|$|The major {{component}} of the funding of Portuguese public higher education institutions comes from the state budget and consists of three separate strands: for teaching (salaries and <b>other</b> <b>current</b> <b>expenditures),</b> for research and for investment. Research funding is allocated mainly through a competitive system while funding for investment results from the Ministry’s approval of each institution’s development plan. Funding for teaching has been allocated by a funding formula since 1986. The formula went through several changes and adaptations but {{it is fair to}} say that until 2003 it was based on inputs, and did not contain indicators related to institutional quality or efficiency. At the time of the 1974 revolution the participation rate was around 7 % and increasing enrolments has been a major political objective until the late 1990 s, which explains the design of the formula that aimed at giving incentives to increasing enrolments. More recently as the gross participation rate (20 - 24 years) is over 50 % and as the number of candidates to higher education is starting to decline due to demography, further increasing of enrolments is no longer a political objective and the government designed a new formula that will increasingly consider institutional performance by moving into a more output oriented approach...|$|R

In addition, government receives transfers from other agents (YGTR) and remuneration of capital (YGK). Similar to household savings, income taxes are considered as a linear function of total income.

40|$|The {{link between}} fiscal policy and {{economic}} growth has raised {{a great deal of}} debate at both theoretical and empirical level. Public expenditure and national income have been the focus of public finance, since the amount of public expenditure has been increasing over time in almost all countries in the world. The aim {{of this study is to}} empirically examine the effects of different types of government expenditures on economic growth, with particular attention to the Italian case. The first chapter of this dissertation offers a literature review on the relationship between the size of government {{and economic growth}} to show how findings follow a contrasting pattern. Moreover, the more recent strand of the literature attempts to evaluate the influence of functional breakdown of public spending on economic growth, thus going beyond the simple division between productive and unproductive expenditure. Studies that disaggregate public expenditures in healthcare, education, defence, infrastructures, housing sector and other expenditures categories show that the results change according to the specific countries under scrutiny, the analysed period and methodologies applied. Chapter two and three examine the empirical relationship between government spending composition and economic growth within an endogenous growth framework as developed by Ghosh and Gregoriou (2008) with two public goods, one being a priori more productive than the other. In particular, the added value of the second chapter lies in its empirical analysis which is based on a panel of 19 Italian regions over the period 1996 - 2007. Our interest is to estimate the influence of economic and functional expenditure categories of the general government on real per capita GDP growth rate. The functional breakdown of expenditures includes six components, which have been obtained aggregating the thirty sectoral expenditure components on the basis of the available data. Interestingly, inside functional categories we distinguish between capital and current items. Using dynamic panel GMM estimators, economic and functional components seem not to have any significant effect on growth. However, the results improve when we take into account spatial correlation through a spatial lag model. Although there is no evidence of spatial autocorrelation in our specifications, the results show that the capital and <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> behaviour is driven by capital transfers and financial assets. In addition, it is also induced by <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on personnel, purchases on goods and services, interest expense and <b>other</b> unclassified <b>current</b> <b>expenditures.</b> As for the functional components, the main result is given by capital expenditure on economic affairs, such as infrastructures, which plays an important role in augmenting the economic growth rate among Italian regions in the period investigated here. <b>Current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on health, and capital and <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> on general public services had a negative and statistically significant effect on growth. The third chapter offers an empirical investigation of the relationship between government spending composition and economic growth by using a historical time-series (for the period 1862 - 2007) on the Italian case. Our aim is to estimate the effects of economic and functional components of government spending on economic growth both in the short- and long-run. After testing our series for unit roots with structural breaks, we divided the sample period into two main sub-samples and estimate the influence of the different components of public spending by means of an ARDL model. Regarding the first sample (1970 - 2007), the most surprising results is the negative effect of capital expenditure on economic growth, both in the short- and in the long-run. In particular, capital expenditure appears to have been excessively high during the period under scrutiny, thus resulting unproductive at margin. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>current</b> <b>expenditure</b> has an insignificant effect on economic growth both in the short- and in the long-run. Among functional components, expenditures on defence and economic affairs have a statistically significant effect on economic growth in the short-run. In contrast, the latter maintains a significant or even negative effect on real per capita GDP in the long-run only. As for the second sample period (1862 - 1969), we split it endogenously so as to establish two structural break dates. Overall, the results vary across sub-samples, but educational spending shows a positive and statistically influence on per capita GDP in the long-run...|$|R
