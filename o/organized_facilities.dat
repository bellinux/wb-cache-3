40|$|This paper uses Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria {{survey data}} on both {{supply and demand}} {{characteristics}} to examine how structural and demographic factors influence family planning provision and cost. The model, which {{takes into account the}} endogenous influence of service provision on average cost, explains provision well but poorly explains what influences service cost. We show that both size and specialization matter. In both countries, vertical (exclusive family planning) facilities provide significantly more contraception than integrated medical establishments. In the Nigeria sample, larger facilities also offer services at lower average cost. Since vertical facilities tend to be large, they at most incur no higher unit costs than integrated facilities. These results are consistent across most model specifications, and are robust to corrections for endogenous facility placement in Nigeria. Model results and cost recovery information point to the relative efficiency of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which operates large, mostly vertically <b>organized</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|E

The ability, attitude, and collaborative team-work demonstrated by the assessment team participants was of a comparable, high standard to those attending assessment meetings that I have participated in within the International Commission for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), Canada, and the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO). The assessment team addressed and met all of its terms of reference and their conclusion that the stock is currently not over-fished and over-fishing is not occurring is appropriate.

40|$|We {{explore a}} new {{general-purpose}} heuristic for finding high-quality solutions to hard optimization problems. The method, called extremal optimization, {{is inspired by}} self-organized criticality, a concept introduced to describe emergent complexity in physical systems. Extremal optimization successively replaces extremely undesirable elements of a single sub-optimal solution with new, random ones. Large fluctuations ensue that efficiently explore many local optima. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance has proved competitive with more elaborate methods, especially near phase transitions which are believed to contain the hardest instances. We use extremal optimization to elucidate the phase transition in the 3 -coloring problem, and we provide independent confirmation of previously reported results for the ground-state energy of±J spin glasses in d = 3 and 4.

50|$|The {{security}} system in Kazakhstan {{is complex and}} multilayered. The Inter-Departmental Commission is charged with coordinating and developing the national information infrastructure.

The Office of the Prime Minister is an authorized state body responsible {{for the protection of}} state secrets and maintenance of information security. Broadly defined, a ‘‘state secret’’ encompasses various government policies as well as information about the president’s private life, health, and financial affairs. The NSC has issued a general license to the private Agency on Information Security to establish and <b>organize</b> <b>facilities</b> for cryptographic protection of information, as well as to formulate proposals on information security to state organizations, corporate clients, banks, and other large commercial companies. The Kazakh Ministry of Internal Affairs operates Department ‘‘K’’, which bears the functions of its counterpart in the Russian Federation. This department is tasked with investigating and prosecuting cyber crime and cyber attacks. At present, ISPs are required to prohibit their customers from disseminating pornographic, extremist, or terrorist materials or any other information that is not in accordance with the country’s laws. Kazakh officials are also considering additional laws to further regulate the Kazakh Internet. One draft law presently under consideration envisions liability for owners of Web sites hosting weblogs and forums, as well as users of chat rooms. The draft law equates Internet sites to media outlets and applies similar regulations with respect to content. The authors of the law justified tighter oversight by the need to fight cyber crime and provide greater accountability for Internet users.|$|R
