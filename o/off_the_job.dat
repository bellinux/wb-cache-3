5|$|The Scranton {{general strike}} was a {{widespread}} work stoppage in 1877 by workers in Scranton, Pennsylvania, {{which took place}} {{as part of the}} Great Railroad Strike, and was the last in a number of violent outbreaks across Pennsylvania. The strike began on July 23 when railroad workers walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in protest of recent wage cuts, and within three days it grew to include perhaps thousands of workers from a variety of industries.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment {{and tries to}} call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, {{he stares at the}} thin slot and grins.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

At Jacob Javits Convention Center, thousands showed up to offer help, where they registered with authorities. [...] Construction projects around the city came to a halt, as workers walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> to help at Ground Zero. [...] Ironworkers, welders, steel burners, and others with such skills were in high demand. By {{the end of the first}} week, over one thousand ironworkers from across North America had arrived to help, along with countless others.|$|R

25|$|More than 300 {{service workers}} at Medical College Hospital walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> on March 19, 1969.

They also insisted that the hospital rehire the 12 workers.|$|E
25|$|Another 25,000 Teamsters walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in a {{sympathy strike}} on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, {{department}} stores and coal companies. The EA and its members then sued nearly every union involved in the strike. Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work.|$|E
25|$|But most {{teachers}} felt the increases were not enough, and a statewide strike occurred. A special {{convention of the}} FEA voted to approve a resolution which condemned the increases as inadequate. In February 1968, FEA president Jane Arnold said the state association would support local teachers if they walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Thousands did. Since strikes were illegal, what actually happened were mass resignations.|$|E

25|$|On June 29, 1894, Debs {{hosted a}} {{peaceful}} meeting to rally {{support for the}} strike from railroad workers at Blue Island, Illinois. Afterward, groups within the crowd became enraged and set fire to nearby buildings and derailed a locomotive. Elsewhere in the western states, sympathy strikers prevented transportation of goods by walking <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> obstructing railroad tracks, or threatening and attacking strikebreakers. This increased national attention {{and the demand for}} federal action.|$|E
25|$|By early October, final {{construction}} on the exhibit hall was ahead of schedule. City officials estimated that the convention center would now be ready {{in time for the}} American Mining Congress trade show in May 1964. A formal opening would occur in August. A slight problem in construction occurred when 30 unionized carpenters walked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> on October 8 in a jurisdictional strike with the Laborers' Union over unloading of material. This delayed construction of a ramp for two days.|$|E

During the construction, plasterers set Macalite hollow tiles, causing bricklayers to walk <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> day after the walkout, the contractor, the Alfred Struck Company of Louisville conceded the point and the bricklayers returned to <b>the</b> <b>job</b> site.|$|R
5000|$|The {{organization}} won a bid on a timber trimming {{contract for}} a {{trail in the}} Salmo-Priest Wilderness.

50|$|The Cantaloupe {{strike of}} 1928 was labor {{movement}} of cantaloupe pickers in Imperial Valley, California. On May 7, 1928 cantaloupe pickers walked <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and <b>the</b> strike lasted to May 10 {{of the same}} year. The strikers had hardly any outside support and many were effectively imprisoned by local police for gathering together in any public space during the strike. The strikers were mostly Mexican immigrants or of Mexican descent because they comprised {{the vast majority of}} produce laborers in California, about “3,500 to 4,000 Mexicans” worked as cantaloupe pickers. While the strike was short-lived and seemingly unorganized, it stands as a victory for the workers.|$|R
