5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from coaching, Nash {{became involved in}} the sporting media. He wrote a column for the Sporting Globe newspaper, spoke at sportsmans' nights and made regular television appearances, including on World of Sport, to comment on Australian rules football and point out that there had not been a player <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> in the VFL since {{his retirement}}.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{the five}} types of living beings, a householder is {{forbidden}} to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life to the best <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting {{his career}} in 1787 as a {{commissioned}} officer in the infantry, before seeing his first action in the Flanders Campaign, Wellesley rose in rank by purchasing his first four commissions, as was common practice in the British Army for wealthy officers. His continued rise in status and fame thereafter was the result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> and success as an army commander.|$|E

5|$|After a {{year away}} from the bike, Marchant {{returned}} to cycling and turned professional in 1958. Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit. The trip was unsuccessful. The group did not take their track bikes with them, with Marchant ordering one from Italy. The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed bikes. Marchant only displayed glimpses <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability,</b> defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania. Marchant then retired in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|Convinced <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability,</b> the Winterhawks persuaded Johansen {{to forego}} {{university}} and join their club for the 2009–10 WHL season. In Portland, {{he joined a}} line with fellow 2010 NHL Entry Draft prospects Nino Niederreiter and Brad Ross. He finished the year with 25 goals and 69 points in 71 games, second among league rookies behind Kevin Connauton and second in team scoring, behind Chris Francis. Helping the Winterhawks make the playoffs one year after finishing last in the WHL, they advanced to the second round. Johansen added 18 points in 13 games, ninth in league scoring and first among rookies, despite playing in only two of four playoff rounds.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E

In the first season, Lana and Clark's {{friendship}} is just beginning, as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time. After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale, Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship. In season seven, Lana leaves Smallville, leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that, even though she loves him, {{the only way for}} him to help the world to the best <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> would be if she left him and Smallville for good.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> as a conductor and was reluctant to {{spend too much time}} performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed in part because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E

5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> when {{preaching to}} a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well {{regarded as a}} lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, his regiment {{was attached to the}} XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS-Hauptsturmführer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability,</b> although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck Misch, who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a convalescent home. For his actions, Misch was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were not serving on the front lines.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to criticize the president or call {{the vice president and}} Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved in {{the leadership of the}} new administration, they were certainly aware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability.</b> There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E

5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{was active}} as a {{researcher}} in the scientific community. After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozoario del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community. He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability,</b> he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases. In 1894, {{he returned to the}} Philippines where he took part in an examination to determine who would become the chief chemist of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape them because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, {{which the government}} wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.|$|E
