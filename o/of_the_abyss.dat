5|$|However, as he dies, Tyball {{reveals that}} {{he had decided to}} contain the Slasher of Veils, whose prison he had been weakening, within Arial as a way to prevent it from {{destroying}} the world. Arial asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of Veils from being unleashed, and magically teleports back to the surface to evacuate its inhabitants. With help from Garamon's ghost, the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano {{at the base of the}} Abyss; the energy they release allows Garamon to open a portal that will send the Slasher of Veils into another dimension. The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension, but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron's ship as the volcano erupts. As the game ends, Garamon's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Abyss</b> to another cave.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on Vesperia {{began in}} 2005. Full {{development}} began in May {{of the following}} year and lasted approximately two years. Returning staff included producer Yoshito Higuchi, composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, and character designer Kōsuke Fujishima. The writers included Takashi Hasegawa and Hideo Baba. Developed by the same team that made Tales of Symphonia and Tales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Abyss,</b> it was designed for the Xbox 360 as the PS3 {{had yet to be}} shown to the company and the former console was achieving international popularity. The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G, with an art style influenced by cel-shaded animation. The game's theme song, Ring a Bell by Bonnie Pink, was used for both the Japanese and English releases. Upon release, the game was an international commercial success, selling over 600,000 copies worldwide. Critical reception has been generally positive, and further media related to the world of Vesperia has been developed.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 {{expedition}} by RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} 28 dives during which over 800 artefacts were recovered, including the ship's engine telegraphs, perfume vials and watertight door gears. In 2001, an American couple – David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller – caused controversy {{when they were}} married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of Titanic, in a deliberate echo of a famous scene from James Cameron's 1997 film. The wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a British company called SubSea Explorer which had offered a free dive to Titanic that Leibowitz had won. He asked whether his fiancée could come too {{and was told that}} she could– but only if she agreed to get married during the trip. The same company also brought along Philip Littlejohn, the grandson of one of Titanics surviving crew members, who became the first relative of a Titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. Cameron himself also returned to Titanic in 2001 to carry out filming for Walt Disney Pictures' Ghosts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Abyss,</b> filmed in 3D.|$|E

5|$|The East End {{has been}} the subject of {{parliamentary}} commissions and other examinations of social conditions since the 19th century, as seen in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor (1851) and Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People in London (third, expanded edition 1902-3, in 17 volumes). Arthur Morrison's novel A Child of the Jago (1896) is set in Bethnal Green, and recounts the story of a boy growing up in a slum surrounding Arnold Circus. Narrative accounts of experiences amongst the East End poor were also written by Jack London in The People <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Abyss</b> (1903), by George Orwell in parts of his novel Down and Out in Paris and London, recounting his own experiences in the 1930s, as well as the Jewish writer Emanuel Litvinoff in his autobiographical novel Journey Through a Small Planet set in the 1930s. A further detailed study of Bethnal Green was carried out in the 1950s by sociologists Michael Young and Peter Willmott, in Family and Kinship in East London.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abyss.</b> Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

25|$|According to one theory, the Greek {{constellation}} {{takes its}} name from the Babylonian constellation known as the Star of Eridu (MUL.NUN.KI).

40|$|Maghrebian {{literature}} {{written in}} French {{has been since}} its inception a literature <b>of</b> and about <b>the</b> <b>abyss.</b> For <b>the</b> Maghrebian <b>the</b> <b>abyss</b> is esentially <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> modernity, that forbidden citadel of art, science and technology from which s/he was excluded and marginalized. Recently, writing of/in French has become <b>the</b> site/scene <b>of</b> a polemos between the archaic (identity) and the post-modern (difference). Our study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archaic focuses on cultural, literary and critical knowledge and centers around two main themes: that of a beginning, that is a search for events {{in the past that}} explain <b>the</b> <b>abyss</b> (or retardation vis-à-vis the West), and that of an excavation, mainly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective unconscious, through <b>the</b> revamping <b>of</b> traditional and oral materials.
