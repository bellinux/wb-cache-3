This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children. In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion <b>of</b> <b>Pluto.</b>|$|E
5|$|Makemake (minor-planet {{designation}} 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf {{planet and}} perhaps the largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population, with a diameter approximately two thirds that <b>of</b> <b>Pluto.</b> Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1. Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about , means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.|$|E
5|$|Makemake was {{expected}} to have an atmosphere similar to that <b>of</b> <b>Pluto</b> but with a lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed {{in front of an}} 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4–12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface.|$|E

5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits <b>of</b> <b>Pluto</b> and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.

5|$|The {{discovery}} {{of several other}} trans-Neptunian objects approaching the size <b>of</b> <b>Pluto,</b> such as Quaoar and Sedna, continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional {{from the rest of}} the trans-Neptunian population. On July 29, 2005, Mike Brown and his team announced the {{discovery of}} a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be more massive than Pluto, named Eris.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere similar to that <b>of</b> <b>Pluto</b> near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that <b>of</b> <b>Pluto,</b> Eris and Triton, {{a large amount of}} nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery <b>of</b> <b>Pluto,</b> but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>Pluto,</b> if not as extreme.|$|E
5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, greater than that <b>of</b> <b>Pluto.</b> This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E
