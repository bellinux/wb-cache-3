50|$|Wound, <b>ostomy</b> and continence {{nursing is}} a nursing tri-specialty {{involved}} with the treatment of patients with acute and chronic wounds, patients with an <b>ostomy</b> (those who have {{had some kind of}} bowel or bladder diversion), and patients with continence conditions (those with bladder and bowel control and associated skin care issues). WOC nurses use evidence-based knowledge and skills to manage these complex patients. Nurses in this specialty are often referred to as wound, <b>ostomy,</b> continence nurses (WOC) nurses. In the United States, certification is available for this specialty from the Wound, <b>Ostomy</b> and Continence Nursing Certification Board. There are additional organizations that offer varying levels of certification in this field (American Board of Wound Management).|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) has risen significantly {{over the past}} decades {{and is expected to}} rise even further in upcoming years. Currently, more than 30 % of the newly diagnosed CRC patients is 75 years or older. The ageing process makes these older heterogeneous group of cancer patients unique. Therefore, age itself is not a useful selection tool for oncologic treatment. Treatment decision making in the elderly is challenging and optimizing this decision making is very important for this heterogeneous group of patients. The aim of this thesis was to obtain more knowledge on the surgical treatment of elderly CRC patients. Furthermore, the impact of <b>ostomies</b> was studied as well as the usefulness of frailty instruments for risk stratification of older patients and the relevance of geriatric consultations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To examine spiritual {{quality of}} life (QOL) of {{veterans}} with intestinal <b>ostomies.</b> Design: Mixed-method cross-sectional. Methods: Male veterans with total scores in the upper (n = 59) and lower (n = 61) quartiles of the City of Hope Quality-of-Life–Ostomy survey provided spiritual QOL data. Analyses included chi-square and analy-sis of variance with significance set at p <. 05. Content {{analysis was used to}} explicate narratives and focus groups. Results: The high spiritual QOL group was more likely to be married, older, and report more years since surgery (each p <. 0001). Upper quartile participants had more favorable scores for several spiritual QOL domains (all p <. 0001). Qualitative comments reflected high or low total QOL scores. Conclusions: Spiritual QOL is influenced by an intestinal stoma. Qualitative comments lend insight into the meaning of spirituality items.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{analyze the}} point of view of nurses in respect to {{educational}} activities aimed at social inclusion of people with <b>ostomies.</b> Method: A qualitative and exploratory, interpretive and critical study based on a dialectical perspective was carried out with six nurses in a municipal rehabilitation center in Rio de Janeiro. The triangulation method was used with individual interviews, participant observation and analysis of documents. Data was analyzed using a historical and dialectical approach. Results: The preparation of people with a stoma in relation to achieving autonomy and independence through teaching self-care was considered important by the nurses; this aspect was highlighted as the most important of all actions performed in the educational process. Conclusions: The nurses had a humanized practice with the educational strategies used by these professionals aiming at making the educational process more dynamic, focused on practical nursing and directed toward real customer needs...|$|R

The patient 2 ̆ 7 s mean age at stoma formation was 46 years (range, 36 to 70 years). Three were female, six were male, {{and all were}} Caucasian. Three patients had colostomies and six had ileostomies. Indications for creation of the <b>ostomies</b> included inflammatory bowel disease in six patients and carcinoma in three patients. The time from creation of the stoma to the first bleed was 11 to 196 months (mean, 82 months). The average time between this bleed and surgical treatment was six months. The operative procedures performed included nine mucocutaneous disconnections (MCD) in seven patients (one for recurrent bleeding) and two stoma relocations (one for recurrence). MCD is simple, quick, and associated with a lower morbidity and intraoperative blood loss than stomal relocation. Post-operative follow-up has ranged from 4 months to 4. 6 years (mean, 2. 5 years). During this period there were two episodes of recurrent varices that required surgery.

40|$|In 1987 and 1990 in Massachusetts, {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to determine the size, pattern of distribution, and trends in the population of children assisted by medical technology. The authors obtained an unduplicated count of all Massachusetts children from 3 months to 18 years of age who used {{one or more of}} the following: tracheostomy, respirator, oxygen, suctioning, gastrostomy, jejunal or nasogastric feedings, <b>ostomies,</b> urethral catheterization, ureteral diversion, intravenous access, or dialysis. By comparing counts obtained from medical and educational sources, the authors were able to perform a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the overall number of children dependent upon these technologies. The number of children identified in our surveys increased from 1, 085 in 1987 to 1, 540 in 1990. However, the capture-recapture analysis yielded estimates of 2, 147 plus or minus 230 for 1987 and 2, 237 plus or minus 131 for 1990. This suggests that the population of children dependent upon medical technology was essentially stable during this period, and that the 42 percent increase in the number of children identified in our survey reflected improved sampling techniques. During the 3 years, shifts in the pattern of technology use were noted, however. Use of oxygen and gastrostomy increased, and urostomy use declined. A change in the age distribution of the children was also documented, with a shift in the preponderence of technology use from 12 to 24 months in 1987 to children in the first year of life in 1990.

40|$|The Jefferson Center for Minimally Invasive Cranial Base Surgery and Endoscopic Neurosurgery {{reflects}} {{three of}} the current evolutions in neurological surgery. The first of these {{is reflected in the}} name of the Center itself. Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive, a Medline Subject Heading since 1998, is defined as: Procedures that avoid use of open invasive surgery in favor of closed or local surgery. These generally involve use of laparoscopic devices and remote-control manipulation of instruments with indirect observation of the surgical field through an endoscope or similar device. With the reduced trauma associated with minimally invasive surgery, long hospital stays may be reduced with increased rates of short stay or day surgery. Traditionally, cranial base tumors have been removed by making craniotomies or cranial base <b>ostomies,</b> and possibly by removing facial bones. To access these areas, surgeons usually need to make potentially disfiguring incisions in the face and scalp. Sometimes the morbidity from the “open” cranial base approach alone could be significant, even with an uneventful removal of the tumor. At the Center, the endoscopic approaches are usually through the nose or nasal passages (Figure 1), however transoral endoscopic approaches to the cranial base and cervical spine are also performed. Because morbidity from the minimally invasive endoscopic approaches is so low, it becomes possible to treat patients with tumors that were previously considered non-resectable or as having too poor a prognosis for more invasive surgery. Even partial resection of such tumors can relieve pain, preserve function, and permit earlier adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim:  Diarrhea and urgency is a {{debilitating}} long term complication of ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) after a proctocolectomy. Somatostatin analogues {{are used to}} control diarrhea and high output <b>ostomies.</b> Hence, we designed a prospective, double blind, cross-over trial to explore the efficacy and tolerability of octreotide to reduce diarrhea in adult patients with IPAA. Methods:  Patients were randomized to octreotide SC 500 μg tid or matching placebo SC for 7 days. Responders (reduction in stool frequency of ≥ 3 and ≥ 30 %, primary endpoint) remained in the same group and non-responders could cross over to the alternative treatment for 7 days. Open label octeotide LAR 30 mg was offered to all responders on day 14. Flexible pouchoscopy with biopsies was performed at baseline in all patients and repeated on day 7, 14 in patients with pouchitis. Results:  Fifteen patients (11 male, median age 52 yrs), all UC, were randomized. Three patients were withdrawn for side effects during the blinded phase. Response was reached by 2 / 12 and 2 / 11 patients treated with octreotide or placebo respectively (including cross-over, p= 0. 9). Median stool frequency remained stable in both groups [Δoctreotide: 0 (IQR - 4 to 0), ΔPlacebo: - 1 (IQR - 1 to 1), p= 0. 45].

40|$|Quality of {{life after}} the {{creation}} of a stoma can be influenced by religious factors. Enterostomal specialist nurses often offer holistic preoperative counseling to discuss religious concerns with Muslim patients, which requires a sound working knowledge of relevant Islamic practices. To assess colorectal surgeon and enterostomal specialist nurse awareness of Islamic practices that influence quality of life in Muslim patients with stomas, a questionnaire comprised of 16 multiplechoice questions was developed and face and content validity established. In addition to the knowledge questionnaire, participant demographic data, including practice setting and geographical location, years in practice, and personal religious affiliation, were included in the data collection instrument. The questionnaires were sent to all members of the World Council of Enterostomal Therapists (WCET) and the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) via association-directed emails. Data were collected over a 5 -month period; 132 responses (90 enterostomal nurses and 42 surgeons) were received. Among the 90 WCET respondents, 29 (32 %) were from the United Kingdom and Europe, 24 (27 %) from the United States, and 10 (11 %) from Australasia, and 10 (11 %) from South East Asia. All 42 ACPGBI respondents were consultant colorectal surgeons from the UK and Ireland. Eight (8) out of 42 surgeons (20 %) and 11 out of 85 nurses (11 %) did not feel confident to discuss religious practices before surgery. Of the 127 respondents who answered the question, only four (< 5 %) correctly identified all Islamic prayer positions. Thirty-two (32, 52 %) of the 62 enterostomal therapists and 27 (73 %) of the 37 surgeons responding did not discuss fasting with Muslim stoma patients. More than one third of all respondents (48 out of 126) did not feel it was necessary to include religious leaders in the counseling process. Awareness of Islamic practices relevant to Muslim persons with <b>ostomies</b> may be suboptimal among colorectal specialists, which may negatively affect patient experiences after stoma surgery.
