40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{orthodontic}} treatment is a functional dental occlusion {{as well as an}} aesthetic smile in harmony with the lower 1 / 3 facial soft tissue. A 3 -dimensional analysis of the patient’s dentofacial relations is crucial for proper treatment planning and it is ultimately the soft tissue that dictates the direction of the orthodontic treatment plan. The purpose of this pilot study is to study the difference of three different medias (3 D photography, 2 D photography, clinical patient evaluation) for facial form analysis. Specifically, to determine which photographic method most closely mimics clinical analysis of facial form for the purpose of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>facial</b> form diagnosis. Two orthodontists analyzed twelve facial measurements on 54 patients (21 male) via 3 D photographs, 2 D photographs and clinical evaluations. In addition, twelve of these patients were randomly chosen for two extra evaluation sessions for intra-rater reliability testing. The twelve categories are the most commonly used measurements by orthodontists to evaluate lower 1 / 3 facial form for diagnosis and treatment planning purposes. Krippendorff’s Alpha reliability testing was used with values > 0. 6 deemed substantially reliable. Results showed poor intra-rater reliability for both evaluators across all three media (only 22 out of 72 total categories substantially reliable) demonstrating the examiners were not reliably consistent with their evaluations. Furthermore, results showed poor reliability testing between the three different medias making comparisons of 3 D vs. 2 D vs. clinical evaluation difficult. Lastly, results showed poor inter-rater reliability for the two evaluators across all three media (zero substantially reliable categories) demonstrating that the two examiners did not agree on any of the facial evaluations. In conclusion, the two orthodontist did not reliably diagnose most of the 12 facial categories using the three given media of clinical, 2 D photography and 3 D photography and they also did not agree with each other’s diagnosis; therefore, {{it is difficult to determine}} if 2 D or 3 D photography provides more diagnosis similarities to clinical evaluation of facial form diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Cleft lip and palate is {{a common}} {{congenital}} malformation with a prevalence of 1 : 600 newborns. Children with orofacial clefts are treated by an interdisciplinary team of specialists while parents and child {{play a key role}} in their own care process. The <b>orthodontic</b> and <b>facial</b> orthopedic treatment of a child with a cleft takes many years. Children often get bored of the long treatment and this can cause problems with compliance and oral hygiene. Therefore it is advisable to distinguish 5 well-defined stages in the orthodontic treatment and to attempt to have some ‘orthodontics free’ time in between. The 3 orthodontic treatment phases between the age of 9 and 20 years consist of orthodontic treatment concerning the closing of the cleft with a bone transplant, the treatment of the permanent dentition and, finally, a possible combined orthodontic surgical treatment at the end of the period of growth. Good interdisciplinary collaboration among the different dental disciplines is essential in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: Not {{all adult}} facial {{asymmetry}} patients are candidates for surgical correction, therefore patient assessment and selection remain major issues in {{diagnosis and treatment}} planning. This study investigated cephalometric variables for distinguishing between adult patients requiring orthognathic surgical versus nonsurgical <b>orthodontic</b> treatment of <b>facial</b> asymmetry. Materials and methods: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) {{analysis was used to}} assess posteroanterior cephalometric measurements. The posteroanterior cephalograms of 60 patients (30 nonsurgical and 30 surgical patients) with facial asymmetry were analyzed, and 51 cephalometric measurements were obtained using computerized cephalometry. Results: Of the 51 measurements, 16 showed statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups. Further ROC analysis was used to determine the ability of the 16 cephalometric parameters to distinguish between the two groups of patients. Optimum discriminant effectiveness was obtained from six statistically validated measurements. For a facial asymmetry patient meeting any four of the six measurement criteria, the sensitivity was 60 % and the specificity was 90 % in determining the need for surgical treatment. The six criteria were mandibular shift angle ≥ 4. 1 °, ∠Ra-Me-ANS ≥ 3. 40 °, ∠Zy-Me-ANS ≥ 5. 30 °, ∠GWSO-Me-ANS ≥ 4. 90 °, ∠J-Me-ANS ≥ 2. 10 °, and Go(ver) -M-ANS ratio ≥ 1. 11. Conclusion: These six cephalometric measurements constituted the minimum number of discriminators needed to obtain optimal discriminant effectiveness of diagnosis between orthognathic surgical and nonsurgical <b>orthodontic</b> treatment of <b>facial</b> asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the craniofacial features of subjects with normal occlusion with different vertical patterns in the mixed dentition using morphometric analysis (Thin-Plate Spline analysis - TPS) applied to posteroanterior (PA) films. The sample comprised 39 individuals (18 females and 21 males), all in mixed dentition, aged from 8. 4 to 10 years with satisfactory occlusion and balanced profile and with no history of <b>orthodontic</b> or <b>facial</b> orthopedic treatment. The sample was divided into three groups (mesofacial, brachyfacial and dolichofacial) according to the facial types proposed by Ricketts (1989). The average craniofacial configurations of each study group were obtained by orthogonal superimposition of Procrustes, thereby eliminating size differences and allowing only shape differences between groups to be analyzed by viewing the TPS deformation grid. Significant differences were found among the three facial types but were more remarkable between mesofacials and dolichofacials than between mesofacials and brachyfacials. TPS morphometric analysis proved efficient for accurate visualization of transverse and vertical differences among facial types even before pubertal growth spurt. These differences cannot be easily detected by traditional posteroanterior cephalometry...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{facial palsy}} {{is the most}} common cause of {{unilateral}} neurologic disorders of the cranial nerves. It can result from congenital, due to delivery traumas, and genetic or malformative diseases, or acquired due to infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, traumatic or iatrogenic causes. In the great majority of cases its causes are unknown. A careful differential diagnosis is recommended in paediatric patients, in order to establish the most appropriate treatment as the therapeutic approach differs in relation to the aetiology. Controversy exists regarding treatment options. The primary concern in the treatment is to restore the aesthetics, function and comfort. Facial palsy may result in a multitude of conditions such as: affected salivation, taste and lachrymation, depending on the topography of the facial nerve affection, and patients may also refer auditory hipersesitivity which may result in noise intolerance. In this paper a case of a child with unilateral facial palsy is described. The patient was treated by orthopaedic appliances and surgical facial reanimation. At the end of therapy good aesthetic and functional results were obtained. Oral functions as well as facial expression were partially recovered and symmetry was almost completely restored. Children with idiopathic facial palsy have a better prognosis if the diagnosis is early and treatment is multidisciplinary.

Facial indices are very important to obtain a <b>facial</b> aesthetic in <b>orthodontic</b> treatment. <b>Facial</b> indices can be influenced by gender and ethnicity. Objectives: To measure facial indices of Chinese ethnic students at the Faculty of Medicine, Maranatha Christian University aged 20 - 22 years old in 2011 using anthropometric measurements. Methods: This was an observational descriptive study. Facial indices of 48 students were measured using dial caliper. Results: Male have larger facial index (89. 5 ± 5. 66), than female (86. 67 ± 4. 45). Mouth-face width index and upper facial index of female was greater when compared with male, which mouth-face index of female was 35. 22 ± 2. 46 while index of male was 34. 69 ± 3. 04. Upper facial index of female was 56. 03 ± 2. 99 and male was 55. 35 ± 3. 72. The lower facial height-facial height index was greater in male (61. 22 ± 1. 77) than female (60. 20 ± 3. 81). Chin-lower facial height index was also greater in male (50. 63 ± 3. 61) than female (49. 64 ± 4. 04).

40|$|Statement of Problem: Evaluation of {{diagnostic}} records {{as a supplement}} to direct examination has an important role in treatment planning of orthodontic patients with aesthetic needs. Photogrammetry as a quantitative tool has recently attracted the attention of researchers again. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to design computer software to analyze <b>orthodontic</b> patients’ <b>facial</b> profile photographic images and to estimate reliability and validity of its measurement. Materials and Method: Profile photographic images of 20 volunteered students were taken in the natural head position with standard technique. Manual linear and angular measurements were used as a gold standard and compared with the results obtained from Aesthetic analyzer Software (designed for that purpose). Dahlberg’s method error and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was used to estimate validity, reliability and inter-examiner errors. Results: Almost all the measurements showed a high correlation between the manual and computerized method (ICC> 0. 75). The maximum method errors computed from Dahlberg’s formula were 1. 345 mm in linear and 3. 294 degrees in angular measurements. At the highest levels, inter-examiner errors were 1. 684 mm and 3. 741 degrees in linear and angular measurements, respectively. Conclusion: Although a low budget has been allocated for the design of Aesthetic Analyzer software, its features are comparable with commercially available products. The software’s capabilities can be increased. The results of the current study indicated that the software is accurate and repeatable in photographic analysis of orthodontic patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Angle Class III {{malocclusion}} {{is characterized}} by an anteroposterior dental discrepancy with or without anteroposterior and vertical skeletal changes.

The present study describes the clinical case of a 12 -year and 6 -month-old girl in her final stage of pubertal growth presenting Class III malocclusion with anteroposterior and vertical discrepancies. Initial treatment consisted of maxillary expansion using a Hass expander followed {{by the use of}} a Petit facemask for a minimum of 16 hours a day. During corrective treatment, Class III elastics were used to complement protraction. At the end of the treatment, skeletal discrepancy had improved, and the ANB angle increased from 0 to 2 o.

[...] He laughed at this, declared it was very well said and that if she could give Madame Carré such a specimen as that----! The actress came in before he had finished his phrase, and he observed the way the girl ruefully rose to the encounter, hanging her head a little and looking out from under her brows. There was no sentiment in her face--only a vacancy of awe and anguish which had not even the merit of being fine of its kind, for it spoke of no spring of reaction. Yet the head was good, he noted at the same moment; it was strong and salient and made to tell at a distance. Madame Carré scarcely heeded her at first, greeting her only in her order among the others and pointing to seats, composing the circle with smiles and gestures, as if they were all before the prompter's box. The old actress presented herself to a casual glance as a red-faced, raddled woman in a wig, with beady eyes, a hooked nose, and pretty hands; but Nick Dormer, who had a sense for the over-scored human surface, soon observed that these comparatively gross marks included a great deal of delicate detail--an eyebrow, a nostril, a flitting of expressions, as if a multitude of little <b>facial</b> <b>wires</b> were pulled from within. This accomplished artist had in particular a mouth which was visibly a rare instrument, a pair of lips whose curves and fine corners spoke of a lifetime of [...] "points" [...] unerringly made and verses exquisitely spoken, helping to explain the purity of the sound that issued from them. Her whole countenance had the look of long service--of a thing infinitely worn and used, drawn and stretched to excess, with its elasticity overdone and its springs relaxed, yet religiously preserved and kept in repair, even as some valuable old timepiece which might have quivered and rumbled but could be trusted to strike the hour. At the first words she spoke Gabriel Nash exclaimed endearingly: [...] "Ah la voix de Célimène!" [...] Célimène, who wore a big red flower on the summit of her dense wig, had a very grand air, a toss of the head, and sundry little majesties of manner; in addition to which she was strange, almost grotesque, and to some people would have been even terrifying, capable of reappearing, with her hard eyes, as a queer vision of the darkness. She excused herself for having made the company wait, and mouthed and mimicked in the drollest way, with intonations as fine as a flute, the performance and the pretensions of the belles dames to whom she had just been endeavouring to communicate a few of the rudiments.

The patients were divided into Classes I, II, and III groups according to their malocclusions. Pre- and posttreatment changes, pretreatment facial esthetics of the paitents and its accordance with their parents, and the calculation of heritability tests were performed. After the statistics, for pre- and posttreatment changes, all the groups except Class I revealed significant changes. There were significant correlations of patients for the heritability values and pretreatment esthetic in accordance with parents, but there were more correlations of fathers when compared to mothers.

Measurements were evaluated by ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey. The Chi-square test was applied for qualitative variables. Upper lip thickness at rest and exposure of upper incisors on smiling decreased with age. Most individuals (60. 9 %) exhibited a medium smile. High smiles were more often seen in G 1 (45 %) and less frequently in G 4 (18. 8 %), whereas the opposite occurred with the low smile, i. e., G 4 (21. 9 %) and G 1 (6. 7 %). Variations among the groups were observed in the transverse exposure of the teeth on smiling. In G 1 and G 3, there was a balance between tooth exposures, so that the teeth were exposed as far as the premolars and/or molars. Most of the women (56. 3 %) in G 2 exposed their teeth as far as the first molars on smiling, whereas most of those (40. 6 %) in G 4 exposed their teeth only as far as the first premolars on smiling.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to formulate cephalometric norms for lateral cephalometric mea-surements of Emirates adults and to study gender differences. Methods—Lateral cephalometric radio-graphs of 176 Emirates adults, 91 males and 85 fe-males, were selected according to the following crite-ria; an age range between 19 to 25 years, esthetically pleasing and harmonious faces with balanced and acceptable profiles and occlusions, normal skeletal and dental relationship, all permanent teeth present, and no history of <b>orthodontic</b> treatment or <b>facial</b> trauma. The mean values and standard deviations of 91 angular and 21 linear cephalometric variables were calculated using the Dolphin version 10. 5 soft-ware package. The resulting norms for Emirates male and female groups were compared using a student t-test. Results—Several statistically significant gender differences were noticeable. Skeletally, Emirates males showed significantly greater (p < 0. 001) total, anterior, and posterior cranial base lengths as well as longer facial heights, greater SGn-FH (°), ANS Xi PM (°),and FH/MP (°) angles than females. In addition, Emirates males had significantly greater (p < 0. 001) Co-A (mm), Co-Gn (mm), and significantly greater (p < 0. 05) Pog-N vert (mm) than females. Dentally, Emirates males had significantly greater (p < 0. 05) UI-SN (°) and U 1 -NA (°), U 1 -NA (mm), and L 1 -NB (mm) (p < 0. 001) than females. For soft tissue measurements there were significant gender differences (p < 0. 001) for all angular and linear measurements except for lower lip to E-plane and nose prominence measurements which have no significant gender difference. Emirates males revealed greater measurements than females except for soft tissue con-vexity, Z-angle, and both upper and lower lips pro-trusion which were significantly greater in Emirates females.
