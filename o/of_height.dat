5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The {{distinction}} between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis <b>of</b> <b>height,</b> especially for competition purposes.

5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons had the advantage <b>of</b> <b>height,</b> they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, {{as a result of}} travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E

5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss <b>of</b> <b>height</b> until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine the cause of the total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the cause of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} façade of {{the main}} wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression <b>of</b> <b>height</b> is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs {{and in this case}} also statues. Both façades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in all on the riverside façade and nine in all on the courtyard façade, to which the riverside façade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the façades are not aligned.|$|E
5|$|The hockey {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter edges {{are called the}} side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post <b>of</b> <b>height</b> 1.201.50m.|$|E

5|$|When the First World War broke out, it was Bassett's {{intention}} {{to join the}} Royal Navy.

Bassett was not particularly tall and was initially rejected due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>height.</b> He persisted with his attempt to enlist, and eventually joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) as a sapper in the Corps of New Zealand Engineers, assigned to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.|$|E
5|$|White's kicking {{accuracy}} was {{of particular}} note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at {{slightly less than}} 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was {{ranked in the top}} five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than as a traditional ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack <b>of</b> <b>height</b> in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to the changed centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack <b>of</b> <b>height</b> and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White's ruck-work during his career.|$|E
5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, versatile and well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his ambidexterity, both inside and outside the area, despite his lack <b>of</b> <b>height</b> or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and dribbling skills, who is also known for his work-rate and intelligent offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping deep to link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E

5|$|After a {{difficult}} start {{to life in}} the First Division, Cardiff secured their first victory in the top division by beating Middlesbrough 3–1. Keenor had been switched to centre-half for the match, a move Fred Stewart had resisted for some time due to his concern of Kennor's lack <b>of</b> <b>height,</b> away from his usual position at right-half and his performance impressed so much that he would go on to play the position for the remainder of his career. The 1921–22 season was also Keenor's tenth year at Ninian Park and he was subsequently awarded a testimonial match against Bristol City. In the following five years, Cardiff became an established side in the First Division, missing out on the league title in the 1923–24 season to Huddersfield Town on goal average after drawing the final game of the season when a win would have guaranteed them the championship.|$|E
5|$|Although {{financial}} {{help from the}} English was not forthcoming, Ferdinand could not break the defenses. On 28 November, ten days after {{the beginning of the}} siege, artillery fire had wasted several thousand pounds of powder in the ineffectual bombardment. Ferdinand moved his cannons to an elevated position in a hillside vineyard {{to the west of the}} Godesburg. The height offered a more advantageous trajectory with which to fire on the walls of the Godesburg's outer ward. Within a few hours, his cannonade had breached them. Ferdinand sent three Italian experts to examine the breach and to advise him on the next step; the Italians, having come under fire during their examination, concluded that storming the castle would incur many casualties. The defenders still had the advantage <b>of</b> <b>height</b> and would be able to shoot at attackers from multiple towers and defensive positions inside the walls. Ferdinand decided not to pursue this tactic. Unable to storm the castle, Ferdinand considered two options: abandon the siege, which he could not do, or blow up the fortress. This option of last resort usually made a fortress unusable. Furthermore while he considered his options, the defenders repaired the breaches caused by the cannonade and reinforced the walls, making them even stronger than they had been. The defenders also removed the roof of the St. Michael's Chapel in the castle's outer ward, filled the chapel with dirt to reinforce its walls, and placed some of their artillery pieces within the walls.|$|E
