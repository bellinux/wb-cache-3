5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Michel Roux is {{the brother}} of Albert Roux. Michel has a son named Alain Roux, while Albert's son is Michel Roux, Jr.. When Alain was ten years old, Michel and his wife divorced, with his wife taking British born Alain and his two sisters to France. Alain would visit during the school {{holidays}} and work with Michel in the kitchens and decided {{at the age of}} fourteen that he wanted to become a chef like his father. Michel met his second wife, Robyn Joyce, after being set up on a blind date with her by former apprentice Leigh Stone-Herbert in Sydney, Australia. The relationship has been credited with <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Australian chefs being trained by the Roux brothers.|$|E

5|$|The king's {{disintegrating}} {{authority over}} his army was also {{manifested in the}} invasion of Frankish Burgundy which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following Mummolus' victory at Embrun. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by Guntram in about 571. Alboin is generally thought {{not to have been}} behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually {{have been involved in the}} offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of Austrasia, Sigebert I. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as Chris Wickham.|$|E
5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E

Jack Gwillim, who had a tiny role as a British army officer, played a Royal Navy officer in Thunderball. Caroline Munro, who can be seen very briefly as one of Dr Noah's gun-toting guards, received the role of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. Milton Reid, who appears in a bit part as the temple guard, <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Mata Bond's hall, played one of Dr. No's guards and Stromberg's underling, Sandor, in The Spy Who Loved Me. John Hollis, who plays the temple priest in Mata Bond's hall, went on to play the unnamed figure clearly intended to be Blofeld in the pre-credits sequence of For Your Eyes Only. John Wells, Q's assistant, appeared in For Your Eyes Only as Denis Thatcher.

500|$|Although Johnson {{is known}} for {{publishing}} Unitarian works, particularly those of Priestley, he also published the works of other Dissenters, Anglicans, and Jews. The common thread uniting his disparate religious publications was religious toleration. For example, he published the Reverend George Gregory's 1787 English translation of Bishop Robert Lowth's seminal book on Hebrew poetry, De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum. Gregory published several other works with Johnson, such as Essays Historical and Moral (1785) and Sermons with Thoughts on the Composition and Delivery of a Sermon (1787). Gregory exemplified the type of author that Johnson preferred to work with: industrious and liberal-minded, but not bent on self-glorification. Yet, as Helen Braithwaite writes in her study of Johnson, his [...] "enlightened pluralistic approach was also seen by its opponents as inherently permissive, <b>opening</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> all forms of unhealthy questioning and scepticism, and {{at odds with the}} stable virtues of established religion and authority".|$|E
