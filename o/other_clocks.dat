500|$|Most of the museum's {{astronomy}} {{collection is}} housed in the octagonal observatory in {{the centre of the}} gardens, built during 1832 and 1833. The design of its rotating roof is credited to John Smeaton designer of the Eddystone Lighthouse. [...] A [...] telescope built in 1850 by the instrument maker Thomas Cooke of York was installed during the observatory's 1981 restoration. It is Yorkshire's oldest working observatory and as of August 2007 was opened to the public by a team of volunteers. The building is currently opened every Thursday and Saturday 11.30 until 2.30. [...] The clock in the observatory was made by Barraud of London in 1811, and during the 19th century it was used to set the time for <b>other</b> <b>clocks</b> in York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the clock chiming has also been used this way in audio media, but as the Westminster Quarters are heard from <b>other</b> <b>clocks</b> and other devices, the sound {{is by no means}} unique. Big Ben is a focus of New Year {{celebrations}} in the United Kingdom, with radio and TV stations tuning to its chimes to welcome the start of the New Year. To welcome in 2012, the clock tower was lit with fireworks that exploded at every toll of Big Ben. Similarly, on Remembrance Day, the chimes of Big Ben are broadcast to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month and the start of the two minutes' silence. Londoners who live an appropriate distance from the tower and Big Ben can, by means of listening to the chimes both live and on analogue radio, hear the bell strike thirteen times. This is possible because the electronically transmitted chimes arrive virtually instantaneously, while the [...] "live" [...] sound is delayed travelling through the air since the speed of sound is relatively slow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} {{that kind of a}} strike before," [...] protested Peter. [...] "It don't sound a bit like <b>other</b> <b>clocks.</b> And the door was shut and the sound kind o' muffled. It's all very fine to say you would have known what it was, but I don't believe you would." ...|$|E
50|$|Cyc01 {{also known}} as cyc0 is a {{recessive}} null mutant allele. This means that a Drosophila with two copies of the cyc01 mutant does not produce a functional CYCLE protein. The resulting Drosophila exhibits arrhythmic activity and cannot entrain to any light-dark cycle. Cyc01 mutants showed a disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep deprivation, although they were more resistant than <b>other</b> <b>clock</b> mutants to various stressors. Unlike <b>other</b> <b>clock</b> mutants, cyc01 flies showed a reduced expression of heat-shock genes after sleep loss. However, activating heat-shock genes before sleep deprivation rescued cyc01 flies from its lethal effects.|$|R
50|$|Overexpression of Cry {{also affects}} {{circadian}} light responses. In Drosophila, Cry overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light. This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of <b>other</b> <b>clock</b> genes and components.|$|R
5000|$|The album's opener, [...] "Outlaw Pete", {{which some}} {{observers}} felt borrowed a central riff from Kiss's 1979 disco hit [...] "I Was Made for Lovin' You", {{is more than}} eight minutes long, while two <b>others</b> <b>clock</b> in at less than three minutes.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{there was}} some ground for supposing that Isaac would devote himself to the {{manufacture}} of clocks; since he had already made one, of a kind which nobody {{had ever heard of}} before. It was set a-going, not by wheels and weights like <b>other</b> <b>clocks,</b> but by the dropping of water. This was an object of great wonderment to all the people round about; and it must be confessed that there are few boys, or men either, who could contrive to tell what o'clock it is by means of a bowl of water.|$|E
60|$|<b>Other</b> <b>clocks</b> struck eight {{from time}} to time--one gloomily from the gaol, another from the gable of an almshouse, with a preparative creak of machinery, more audible than the note of the bell; a row of tall, {{varnished}} case-clocks from {{the interior of a}} clock-maker's shop joined in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them, like a row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the curtain; then chimes were heard stammering out the Sicilian Mariners' Hymn; so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably {{on their way to the}} next hour before the whole business of the old one was satisfactorily wound up.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{far from}} this bedstead, propped in an {{intoxicated}} way against the sloping {{wall of the}} old house, stood the clock which I desired. It {{was one of the}} first [...] "regulator" [...] clocks with a wooden pendulum, used by the maker himself to check the time-keeping of all his <b>other</b> <b>clocks,</b> and enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period. So beautiful was it, indeed, that it had been an instance of [...] "love at first sight" [...] between us, and although there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements, or in other words over the question of price, now I felt that never more could that clock and I be parted.|$|E
5000|$|Internal timing: In this mode, the {{internal}} clock of the EEC {{is used to}} synchronize outputs. It may be a temporary holdover stage after losing the synchronization signal, {{or it may be}} a simple line configuration where no <b>other</b> <b>clock</b> is available.|$|R
25|$|Because of this tilt, one light-second on the ct axis maps {{to greater}} than one light-second on the ct axis. Likewise, one light-second on the ct axis maps to greater than one light-second on the ct axis. Each {{observer}} measures the <b>other's</b> <b>clocks</b> as running slow.|$|R
50|$|Observers in {{different}} locations, {{that are in}} relative motion or at different altitudes, can disagree about the rates of each <b>other's</b> <b>clocks,</b> owing to effects described by the theory of relativity. As a result, TT (even as a theoretical ideal) does not match the proper time of all observers.|$|R
6000|$|The great clock {{has seven}} faces--one {{in each of}} the seven sides of the steeple--so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most perfect of sinecures--for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have {{anything}} the matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was just the same with all the <b>other</b> <b>clocks</b> and watches in the borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought proper to say [...] "Twelve o'clock!" [...] all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} {{circumstances}} of the room, and the fear lest Miss Trelawny should return unexpectedly and find me reading the book, disturbed me somewhat. For we had arranged amongst us, before Doctor Winchester had gone home, that she was not to be brought into the range of the coming investigation. We considered that there might be some shock to a woman's mind in matters of apparent mystery; and further, that she, being Mr. Trelawny's daughter, might be placed in a difficult position with him afterward if she took part in, or even had a personal knowledge of, the disregarding of his expressed wishes. But when I remembered that she did not come on nursing duty till two o'clock, the fear of interruption passed away. I had still nearly three house before me. Nurse Kennedy sat in her chair by the bedside, patient and alert. A clock ticked on the landing; <b>other</b> <b>clocks</b> in the house ticked; the life of the city without manifested itself in the distant hum, now and again swelling into a roar as a breeze floating westward took the concourse of sounds with it. But still the dominant idea was of silence. The light on my book, and the soothing fringe of green silk round the shade intensified, whenever I looked up, the gloom of the sick-room. With every line I read, this seemed to grow deeper and deeper; so that when my eyes came back to the page the light seemed to dazzle me. I stuck to my work, however, and presently began to get sufficiently into the subject to become interested in it.|$|E

50|$|A clock {{network or}} clock {{system is a}} set of {{synchronized}} clocks designed to always show exactly the same time by communicating with each <b>other.</b> <b>Clock</b> networks usually consist of a central master clock kept in sync with an official time source, and one or more slave clocks which receive and display the time from the master.|$|R

50|$|Common sense would dictate that, if {{the passage}} of time has slowed for a moving object, said object would observe the {{external}} world's time to be correspondingly sped up. Counterintuitively, special relativity predicts the opposite.

5000|$|Given {{a certain}} frame of reference, and the [...] "stationary" [...] {{observer}} described earlier, if a second observer accompanied the [...] "moving" [...] clock, {{each of the}} observers would perceive the <b>other's</b> <b>clock</b> as ticking at a slower rate than their own local clock, due to them both perceiving the other {{to be the one}} that's in motion relative to their own stationary frame of reference.|$|R
5000|$|Clock drift {{refers to}} several related {{phenomena}} where a clock does not run {{at exactly the}} same rate as a reference clock.
