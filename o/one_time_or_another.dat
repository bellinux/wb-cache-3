40|$|The {{increase}} of herbal medicine use led many scientists {{to contribute to}} the research in this field. Also a few pharmacologists, after an initial phase of correct criticisms, today recognize the possibility of investigating the scientific value of medicinal products composed essentially of vegetable extracts. However, it is logical to pose the questions: (i) is there a role for the pharmacologist in herbal medicine (or phytotherapy) ? (ii) can we do without pharmacologists’? First, two worlds—drug researchers (pharmacologists) and herbal medicines—yesterday appearing in opposition, are today closer and it is not unusual to read scientific works describing herbal extracts in journals traditionally dedicated to the study of synthetic drugs. Second, clinical application of herbal medicines is evaluable through the methods of modern clinical pharmacology. Efficacy and safety of medicinal plants represent naturally the object of interest for the pharmacologist and it is surely this aspect which gives the most important information on herbal medicine use. Many plants have been studied and results published showing, <b>one</b> <b>time</b> good <b>or</b> <b>another</b> poor, efficacy. Safety aspects {{of some of the most}} frequently used plants are now well known. For example, today we learn to use hypericum and we do not give it to patients taking other drugs because the interactions of hypericum with them. Contraindications of other plants, often represented by interactions with drugs, are finally known (Ginkgo biloba and drugs acting on blood coagulation). In conclusion, antagonistic behavior of pharmacologists versus herbal medicines is not useful. On the contrary, modern phytotherapy needs the contribution of researchers usually trained to evaluate efficacy and safety of medicinals...|$|R

At <b>one</b> <b>time</b> point <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> EBV was detected in saliva {{from each of the}} astronauts. Of 1398 saliva specimens from 32 astronauts, polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that 314 (23 %) were positive for EBV DNA. Examination by flight phase showed that 29 % of the saliva specimens collected from 28 astronauts before flight were positive for EBV DNA, as were 16 % of those collected from 25 astronauts during flight and 16 % of those collected after flight from 23 astronauts. The mean number of EBV copies from samples taken during the flights was 417 per mL, significantly greater (p<. 05) than the number of viral copies from the preflight (40) and postflight (44) phases. In contrast, the control subjects shed EBV DNA with a frequency of 3. 7 % and mean number of EBV copies of 40 per mL of saliva. Ten days before flight and on landing day, titers of antibody to EBV viral capsid antigen were significantly (p<. 05) greater than baseline levels. On landing day, urinary levels of cortisol and catecholamines were greater than their preflight values. In a limited study (n= 5), plasma levels of substance P and other neuropeptides were also greater on landing day. Increases in the number of viral copies and in the amount of EBV-specific antibody were consistent with EBV reactivation before, during, and after space flight...|$|R
40|$|Does direct {{democracy}} tend to endanger or to protect minorities inmulticultural countries? The {{response to this}} question has beencontroversial. Some scholars believe that {{direct democracy}} may resultin “disregard of basic minority rights”; others think that it “serves to protect minorities”. This paper explores the experience of Switzerland, a longstanding multilingual democracy and the country in which half of worldwide referendums and popular initiatives have been held. First, it points out some major methodological problems that research trying to quantify the cases of “minorisation” of linguistic groups needs to face. Second, it illustrates the relation between popular votes and the deepening of the linguistic cleavage in Switzerland in the 1990 s. Finally, four case studies explore the experience of the multilingual cantons. In the vast majority of cases, the use of referendums and popular initiatives in the cantons has not caused particular problems for minorities, although from <b>time</b> to <b>time</b> <b>one</b> group <b>or</b> <b>another</b> is outvoted. Nevertheless, direct democracy {{has been a source of}} intergroup tensions and misunderstandings when the issues at stake were closely related to identity, culture, language, or balance of power between linguistic communities...|$|R

At <b>one</b> point in <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> the perception of President Richard M.

Using Peter Checkland`s Appreciative System and Soft Systems Methodology we can also conceptualize reflection as a systematic approach to the process of inquiry into problematic situations, approaching the issues in a soft, purposeful way (instead of a hard, goal-oriented one), in appreciation of the important concerns of a given situation (like maintenance of existing relationships). We can also use natural science phenomena to explain reflection in a more systematic way. It seems that many issues about reflection have their origins in the natural sciences, and we can use these as metaphors to explain and make use of the term as a psychological and social concept...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} how {{the fundamentals of}} human child rearing emerged among the ancestors of modern humans. These fundamentals produced the universal requirements for human parenting. Good parenting requires that these fundamentals be met, although how this is done has differed from <b>one</b> place <b>or</b> <b>time</b> to <b>another.</b> All people respond to the constraints and possibilities they face in a given environment by developing cultural meanings, values, and practices {{to make sense of}} and act on their world, allowing them to develop sustainable lives, including sustainable practices for rearing healthy children. By looking at the expectations and demands of human parenting and what makes it unique, we can develop an understanding of the social world needed to support the physical growth and emotional development of any child. This also gives us a foundation from which to analyse parenting practices across societies. This in turn allows us to reframe the changing experiences that Aboriginal mothers have confronted over time in Australia. We are advocating a more nuanced understanding of the deep origins of human mothering as it is physically, culturally, and socially constituted. Importantly, we show that it requires more human labour than a mother can provide herself, and that a pattern of cooperative parenting is grounded within these fundamentals of child rearing...|$|R
