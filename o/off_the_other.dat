5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{is asked}} to visit the Dunder Mifflin {{branches}} to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam (Jenna Fischer), who is coming along as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael {{is not ready to}} face his ex-girlfriend Holly, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly.|$|E
5|$|Employees {{arrive at}} a Dunder Mifflin company picnic, where Michael (Steve Carell) plans to win back his ex-girlfriend Holly (Amy Ryan), whom he has not seen since she was {{transferred}} to Nashua. Holly arrives with her boyfriend A. J. (Rob Huebel), who tells Michael the couple are designing a house together. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) allows Michael and Holly to do a presentation {{about the history of}} Dunder Mifflin, and the two spend time in the woods to come up with ideas. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) run into Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{for the first time since}} he left Scranton, and Charles is still short with Jim. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) brings his new best friend, Rolf (James Urbaniak), who makes constant insults to Angela (Angela Kinsey) for breaking Dwight's heart; Dwight tells Rolf to stop, much to Angela's surprise. The Scranton branch competes in the picnic's volleyball tournament, facing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> branches of Dunder Mifflin. They initially struggle until Pam reveals herself to be a very talented volleyball player. With her help, they reach the final round where they face the corporate head office.|$|E
5|$|While being {{examined}} {{to increase his}} ninja rank, Naruto meets the legendary ninja Jiraiya and learns how to summon toads to aid him in battle, and to control part of the Nine Tails's chakra energy. The exams are interrupted by the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal Orochimaru and the ninja of Sunagakure. Naruto defeats the sand village's One Tail Jinchuriki Gaara and convinces him {{there is a better}} way to live. Shortly afterward, Naruto discovers the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine-Tails from his body. Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting, learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke's brother, and the man who killed their family, the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto. While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new village leader, Naruto also learns the Rasengan, a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes. When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi, Naruto becomes part of a rescue team to retrieve him. Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one-on-one battle, though neither can bring himself to finish <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The two go their separate ways, but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki.|$|E

25|$|During Father Le Loutre's War, the {{soldiers}} guarding Halifax {{were in a}} constant state of alert. The Mi'kmaq and Acadians raided the capital region (Halifax and Dartmouth) 12 times. The worst of these raids was the Dartmouth Massacre (1751). Four of these raids were against Halifax. The first raid was in July 1750: in the woods on peninsular Halifax, the Mi'kmaq scalped Cornwallis' gardener, his son, and four others. They buried the son, left the gardener's body exposed, and carried <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> four bodies.|$|E

25|$|After commissioning, LST-32 {{served as}} a {{training}} platform in Chesapeake Bay, until March 1944, when she crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the Mediterranean Sea. On 1 April, while proceeding in a convoy from the Algerian coast to the island of Majorca, she and her consorts endured a low level attack by a formation of three German twin-engine bombers. Antiaircraft fire splashed {{one of them and}} drove <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two. The ship operated into the summer with the task group that resupplied the Anzio beachhead. Early in August, she prepared for the invasion of southern France, and, during the landings on 15 August, was among the LSTs off the Îles d'Hyères as senior radar ship. She sent two separate radar units ashore on Port Cros, one on 15 August, and the second on the following day.|$|E
25|$|Outside, Tormund {{moves to}} kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is {{ultimately}} unable {{to kill the}} innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and {{heading back to the}} Wall. At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family, and they depart shortly after.|$|E
25|$|The {{main story}} {{leading up to}} the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was {{replaced}} by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the best of a bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.|$|E

The song writing process started off with a guitar part, Nolan and Lazzara would work on lyrics and melodies, and then bounce ideas <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members.

500|$|That {{night he}} {{received}} word to expect an attack {{the following day}} by British capital ships escorted by {{a large number of}} destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. Erich Giese reported that she was only capable of , although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers. The battleship [...] and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, not including Giese, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. The ship did not have enough steam raised to participate and remained in the harbor. She attempted to leave the harbor after the British had driven <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> German ships, but her port engine seized up and left her almost dead in the water {{at the mouth of the}} harbor. While attempting to repair her engine, Giese was approached by the destroyers [...] and [...] which fired five torpedoes at her. All of them missed and Gieses torpedoes were equally unsuccessful. She did hit Punjabi with six or seven 12.7cm shells which holed the ship several times just above the waterline, wrecked her fire-control system, severed her main steam line and started several fires. Casualties aboard Punjabi were seven killed and 14 wounded. In the meantime, Giese had managed to repair her engine after ten minutes of work and limped forward at her maximum speed of [...] to engage the remaining British destroyers. Bedouin closed to point-blank range and had her forward gun turret knocked out by Giese, but the latter was hit at least 20 times and reduced to a blazing wreck that finally sank shortly before midnight. Eighty-three of her crew were killed outright during the battle, but the destroyer [...] did rescue 11 men, although two subsequently died of their wounds. Surviving crew members later testified that they had been fired upon while drifting in the water. The ship's remaining crewmen managed to get ashore one way or another.|$|E

2500|$|Design flaws: al-Salam Boccaccio 98 was a roll on-roll off (ro-ro) ferry. This is {{a design}} that allows {{vehicles}} to drive on one end and drive <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> [...] This means that neither the ship nor any of the vehicles need to turn around at any point. It also means that the cargo hold is one long chamber going through the ship. To enable this to work, the vehicle bay doors must be very near the waterline, so unless these are sealed properly, water may leak through. Even {{a small amount of}} water moving about inside can gain momentum and capsize a ship, in a way known as the free surface effect.|$|E

In 1849 he went to work for Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company as a gunsmith under contract, turning revolver barrels on a lathe. During this time he procured two [...] "junk" [...] or scrapped revolver cylinders from Colt and placed them in his barrel lathe, cutting the front off one and the rear <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He assembled these parts into a single bored-through cylinder that would fit in a Colt revolver.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between a master and a clever servant is also a common element in Elizabethan comedy. [...] Shakespeare often includes foils for his characters to have one set <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> In Elizabethan romantic comedy, {{it is common for}} the plays to end with multiple marriages and couplings of pairs. This is something that is not seen in Plautine comedy. In the Comedy of Errors, Aegeon and Aemilia are separated, Antipholus and Adriana are at odds, and Antipholus and Luciana have not yet met. At the end, all the couples are happily together. By writing his comedies in a combination of Elizabethan and Plautine styles, Shakespeare helps to create his own brand of comedy, one that uses both styles.|$|E
