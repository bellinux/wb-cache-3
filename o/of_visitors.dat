40|$|An {{integrative}} suicide {{prevention program}} was implemented to tackle an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> charcoal burning suicides in Cheung Chau, {{an island in}} Hong Kong, in 2002. This study evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} program. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicides reduced from 37 deaths in the 51 months prior to program implementation to 6 deaths in the 42 months post-implementation period. The number <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicide pacts decreased from 7 pacts (15 individuals) to 1 pact (2 individuals). No statistically significant differences in the numbers <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicide attempts and resident suicides were observed in the two time periods. No statistically significant changes in visitor suicides during the study period were observed on the comparison islands. The consistency and timing <b>of</b> reduction in <b>visitor</b> suicides correlated with the development and delivery of the integrative program on the intervention island, suggesting a causal association between program delivery and reduction <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> suicides. The possibility of displacement seems small because there was no increase in visitor suicides on the comparison islands during the study period. This integrative approach in preventing target- specific suicides may serve as an example for other communities to develop suicide prevention programs that make use of the existing local resources.

40|$|Visitor {{expenditure}} is {{an important}} driver of demand in many local economies, supporting a range of services and facilities {{which may not be}} viable based solely on residential demand. In areas where self-catering accommodation is prevalent visitor demand makes up a considerable proportion of sales and revenue within grocery stores, yet this form <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> consumption is commonly overlooked in supply and demand-side estimates <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> spend. As such, store location planning in tourist resorts, decisions about local service provision and the local economic impacts of tourism are based on very limited demand-side estimates <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> spend. Using Cornwall, South West England as a study area, we outline a methodology and data sources to estimate small-area visitor grocery spend. We use self-catering accommodation provision, utilisation and visitor expenditure rates as key factors driving visitor spend. We identify that the use <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> accommodation accounts for the spatial and temporal complexities <b>of</b> <b>visitor</b> demand that may be overlooked when using alternative approaches, such as the up-scaling of residential demand. Using a spatial interaction model, we demonstrate that our expenditure estimates can be used to generate store level revenue estimation within tourist resorts, and we make a number of recommendations for service provision and store location planning in these areas...|$|R
