50|$|If long, {{the cost}} <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> {{is the cost}} of {{interest}} paid on a margin account.

For most investments, the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> generally refers to the risk-free interest rate that could be earned by investing currency in a theoretically safe investment vehicle such as a money market account minus any future cash flows that are expected from holding an equivalent instrument with the same risk (generally expressed in percentage terms and called the convenience yield). Storage costs (generally expressed {{as a percentage of the}} spot price) should be added to the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model to the pricing of the electricity futures contract in New Zealand. Analysis of the data indicates that the spot price is substantially more volatile than the futures price. OLS regression analysis provides little evidence in support of the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model, using either levels data or first difference data. The evidence strongly suggests the futures price moves independently of the theoretical futures price derived from the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model. There is some evidence that the futures prices is driven by past levels of the spot price. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} worst {{currency}} carry loss episodes in recent decades, including causes, attribution by currency, timing, and the duration <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> drawdowns. To explore {{the determinants of}} the length <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> losses, a model <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> drawdown duration is estimated. We find evidence that drawdown duration varies systematically with expected return from the carry trade {{at the onset of}} the drawdown, financial stress indicators and the magnitude of deviations from a fundamental value portfolio of the carry-related portfolio holdings. In an out-of-sample test, we show that these determinants can be used to control carry-related losses and improve investment performance...|$|R
5|$|A {{drawback}} <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> WE.177 {{on external}} pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing. WE.177A {{was limited to}} a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1.15 at low level on TSR-2, otherwise the bomb's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum. This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR-2, as the aircraft was designed for M=1+ cruise at this height.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed to be capable <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO {{would be able to}} switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{how well the}} pricing model of Hsu and Wang (2004) explains the behavior of stock index futures prices for the developed markets (such as the S&P 500 index futures market) and the emerging markets (such as the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) Taiwan stock index futures market). It also compares the pricing performance of three alternative pricing models of stock index futures: the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model, the Hemler and Longstaff (1991) model, and the Hsu–Wang model. Overall, the Hsu–Wang model provides significantly better pricing performance {{than that of the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model in emerging markets with high degrees of imperfection. Moreover, this study also observes that the Hemler and Longstaff (1991) model performs better than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model in estimating prices of the TAIFEX futures, suggesting that the incorporation of stochastic market volatility is beneficial to predict the TAIFEX futures prices.
