25|$|Israel {{disputes}} whether, {{and if so}} to what extent, it is an <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> {{in relation}} to the Palestinian territories and as to whether Israeli settlements in these territories are in breach of Israel's obligations as an <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> and constitute a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and whether the settlements constitute war crimes. In 2015, over 800,000 Israelis resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines, constituting nearly 13% of Israel's Jewish population.|$|E
5000|$|The rules {{set out in}} the Hague Convention {{also apply}} to States who are <b>Occupying</b> <b>Powers</b> of {{territory}} during conflict or otherwise.

25|$|French {{sovereignty}} persisted {{throughout the}} whole territory, including the zone occupée, Alsace and Moselle, but {{the terms of the}} armistice in its third article stipulated that Germany would exercise the rights of an <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> in the zone occupée.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Mughals, under European colonial rule, {{architecture}} became {{an emblem of}} power, designed to endorse the <b>occupying</b> <b>power.</b> Numerous European countries invaded India and created architectural styles reflective of their ancestral and adopted homes. The European colonizers created architecture that symbolized their mission of conquest, dedicated to the state or religion.|$|E
25|$|Laws banning {{circumcision}} {{are also}} ancient. The ancient Greeks prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision. 1 Maccabees, 1:60–61 states that King Antiochus IV of Syria, the <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> of Judea in 170 BCE, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death. {{one of the}} grievances leading to the Maccabean Revolt.|$|E

50|$|The Council {{recognised}} {{the responsibilities}} and obligations of the United Kingdom and United States as <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> and {{of other states}} that were not <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> as working under their command. It welcomed the commitment of Member States towards the stability of Iraq, remained concerned {{about the fate of}} Kuwaiti and third-state nationals unaccounted for since 2 August 1990 (the day Iraq invaded Kuwait) and determined that the situation in Iraq remained a threat to international peace and security.|$|R
25|$|The treaty {{ended the}} {{military}} occupation of West German territory, {{but the three}} <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> retained some special rights, e.g. vis-à-vis West Berlin.|$|R
25|$|This announcement, coming {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the S-Plan attacks, sought to present {{the actions of the}} IRA as those of a legitimate, de jure government. Within this context, with the Army Council acting as government, with the right to use force and levy war against an <b>occupying</b> <b>power,</b> the IRA declared war on Britain in January 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} community regards {{all of the}} Palestinian territories including Gaza as occupied. Human Rights Watch has declared at the UN Human Rights Council that it views Israel as a de facto <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel has no military or other presence, because the Oslo Accord authorizes Israel to control the airspace and the territorial sea.|$|E
25|$|The Iraq War {{began in}} March 2003 as an {{invasion}} of Ba'athist Iraq by a force led by the United States. The Ba'athist government led by Saddam Hussein was toppled within a month. This conflict {{was followed by a}} longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an <b>occupying</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

25|$|The aid {{contributions}} of China and the United States were given focus {{with regards to}} their involvement {{in the politics of}} the Philippines. Apart from having the two largest economies in the world, both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country. China is currently disputing the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea with the Philippines while the United States used to be an <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands.|$|E

While interned, she discovers the location {{of her mother and}} father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over – Australia signs a peace treaty with the <b>occupying</b> <b>power,</b> resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent to the Second Intifada, Israeli prime {{minister}} Ariel Sharon proposed the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2003, which {{was approved by}} the Israeli government in June 2004, and the Knesset in February 2005. The unilateral withdrawal plan was executed in August 2005 and completed in September 2005. Nonetheless, the ICRC, the UN and various human rights organizations consider Israel still to be the de facto <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> due to its control of Gaza's borders, air space and territorial waters.|$|E
2500|$|Article 46 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 {{regarding}} Land Warfare explicitly {{required that}} [...] "amily honour and rights [...] {{the lives of}} persons...must be respected" [...] by the <b>occupying</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Wartime sexual {{violence}} is rape {{or other forms}} of {{sexual violence}} committed by combatants during armed conflict or war or military occupation often as spoils of war; but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. It is distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery by an <b>occupying</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of the designation of these territories as occupied territory is that certain legal obligations fall on the <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> under international law. Under international law there are certain laws of war governing military occupation, including the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention. One of those obligations is {{to maintain the status}} quo until the signing of a peace treaty, the resolution of specific conditions outlined in a peace treaty, or the formation of a new civilian government.|$|E
25|$|Ma'ale Adumim {{is widely}} {{regarded}} {{by the international community}} as illegal under international law according to the Fourth Geneva Convention (article 49), which prohibits an <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> transferring citizens from its own territory to occupied territory. Israel maintains that international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the West Bank because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. This view was rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s a Harvard-trained {{lawyer and}} historian, Alfred de Zayas, {{published}} Nemesis at Potsdam and A Terrible Revenge, {{both of which}} became bestsellers in Germany. De Zayas argues that the expulsions were war crimes and crimes against humanity even {{in the context of}} international law of the time, stating, [...] "the only applicable principles were the Hague Conventions, in particular, the Hague Regulations, ARTICLES 42–56, which limited the rights of <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> – and obviously <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> have no rights to expel the populations – so there was the clear violation of the Hague Regulations." [...] He argued that the expulsions violated the Nuremberg Principles.|$|R
50|$|Some also {{speculate}} that {{news of the}} German military setbacks at the Battle of Stalingrad had reached the Norwegian resistance movement, and that Nazi <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> were anxious to discourage more assertive, bold moves by the resistance.|$|R
25|$|After the invasion, {{cooperation}} between Germany and the Soviet Union was visible, for example, {{in the four}} Gestapo-NKVD Conferences, where the <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> discussed plans {{for dealing with the}} Polish resistance movement and for the further destruction of Poland.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Romania was {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union. A trusted government official and a leading member of an influential political party, Georgescu was appointed general secretary of the Armistice Commission, responsible for negotiating the conditions for peace with the <b>occupying</b> <b>power.</b> The negotiations dragged out for half a year and came to involve long and stressful discussions: During most of the war, Romania had been an Axis power allied with Nazi Germany, so the Soviet representatives treated the Commission as nothing but a vehicle for levying the largest possible amount of war reparations on the Romanian people.|$|E
25|$|A year later, on April 3, 1995, the Hebron municipality, {{through its}} mayor Mustafa al-Natshe, invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to {{function}} as a violence-reducing presence. Opposed to all forms of violence - they have informed local Israeli settlers that they 'stood with whomever was {{on the receiving end of}} a gun barrel,' they now assist the local Palestinian community cope with the numerous restrictions - settler harassment, home demolitions, curfews and land confiscations - they are subjected to by the <b>occupying</b> <b>power</b> in what CPT, whose function is to monitor the tensions and accompany the Palestinian Hebronites on their daily rounds, calls collective punishment.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} the Germans were welcomed by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its oppressions, and hopes were raised {{for the restoration}} of the country's independence, it was soon realised that the Nazis were but another <b>occupying</b> <b>power.</b> The Germans used Estonia's resources for their war effort; {{for the duration of the}} occupation Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland. The Germans and their Estonian and other collaborators also carried out The Holocaust in Estonia in which they established a network of 22 concentration camps and murdered thousands of Estonian Jews and Estonian Gypsies, other Estonians, non-Estonian Jews, and Soviet prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|In June 1942, {{political}} leaders of Estonia who had survived Soviet repressions held a meeting {{hidden from the}} <b>occupying</b> <b>powers</b> in Estonia where {{the formation of an}} underground Estonian government and the options for preserving continuity of the republic were discussed.|$|R
50|$|Although {{other such}} small exchanges took place {{afterwards}} on the inner-German border, only the Wanfried Agreement had {{the status of}} a treaty between the <b>occupying</b> <b>Powers,</b> and is considered to have been on an equal footing with the Potsdam Agreement.|$|R
50|$|Due to the endeavors of the Western Powers, this {{commission}} met in December 1951. East Germany {{refused to let}} them enter, however. In their opinion, the possibility of free elections should be investigated by a commission of the four <b>Occupying</b> <b>Powers.</b>|$|R
