5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of <b>optical</b> <b>communication,</b> especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E

2500|$|An optical {{amplifier}} is {{a device that}} amplifies an optical signal directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An {{optical amplifier}} may {{be thought of as}} a laser without an optical cavity, or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in <b>optical</b> <b>communication</b> and laser physics. [...] An important practical goal is to develop an amplifier adequate for use as an optical repeater in the long distance fiberoptic cables which carry much of the world's telecommunication links. Existing fiberoptic repeaters must convert the light beam to an electronic signal to amplify it, then convert it back to light.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distributed}} feedback laser (DFB) {{is a type}} {{of single}} frequency laser diode. [...] DFBs are the most common transmitter type in DWDM-systems. To stabilize the lasing wavelength, a diffraction grating is etched close to the p-n junction of the diode. This grating acts like an optical filter, causing a single wavelength to be fed back to the gain region and lase. Since the grating provides the feedback that is required for lasing, reflection from the facets is not required. Thus, at least one facet of a DFB is anti-reflection coated. The DFB laser has a stable wavelength that is set during manufacturing by the pitch of the grating, and can only be tuned slightly with temperature. DFB lasers are widely used in <b>optical</b> <b>communication</b> applications where a precise and stable wavelength is critical.|$|E
2500|$|Response time: A photon {{absorbed by}} the {{semiconducting}} material will generate an electron-hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under {{the effect of the}} electric field and thus generate a current. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using Ramo's theorem. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is well e and not 2e as might seem by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the integral of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as RC time constant [...] This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the impulse response of the photodiode. When used in an <b>optical</b> <b>communication</b> system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.|$|E
