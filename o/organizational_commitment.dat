Some business of service industry operate 24 hours a day demand, such as convenience chain stores, KTVs and hypermarkets. Such organizations demand more manpower, whether it's regular or part-time employees. Recruiting part-time employees to most service organization are to simplify their human resources structure, to lower costs, to increase the elasticity of operation and to satisfy customer's demand. Among the service industry, the convenience chain retailing {{is the focus of}} this study. Front-line employees of convenience stores are important factors that influencing company's profit and performance. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} work values, job satisfactions and <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments</b> on front-line full-time and part-time employees. By study those factors, it will help manage its full-time and part-time employees in the areas, such as attrition and better customer service. This research studied front-line employees of a convenience chain stores in central Taiwan, including both full-time and part-time employees. It tries to analyze and understand employees' work values, job satisfactions and their <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments,</b> and to examine the effect of work values on job satisfactions, and <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments.</b> Through surveying and statistical analysis, the study discovered that: (1) The demographic data of the front-line employees in the convenience chain store are mainly single females, usually are 25 years old or young, with high school or vocational high school background, their work experience usually less than 3 years and they work than 50 hours per week on average. (2) In terms of work values, job satisfactions and <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments,</b> there is no significant difference between full-time and part-time employees. (3) Among full-time employees, marital status and average working hours per week would influence their work values; average working hours per week would influence their job satisfactions; their marital status, age, average income, and work experience would also influence their <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments.</b> However, among part-time employees, only age would influence their work values. (4) There is a positive relationship between work values, job satisfactions, and <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments</b> for both full-time and part-time employees. (5) In general, employees' work values have significant and positive effect on job satisfactions and <b>organizational</b> <b>commitments.</b> There is no difference between full-time and part-time employees. 台灣地區已邁入一個以服務為導向的服務經濟時代。服務業的產業特性，是『以人為主的產業』，員工主要工作性質在於『直接對顧客提供服務』，服務業中一些營業時間為二十四小時的行業，例如連鎖便利商店、KTV及量販店等，對人力的需求更甚，乃會僱用『兼職員工』因應多樣性營業方式；對企業而言，可達到精簡人事組織、降低成本、增加營業彈性及符合顧客需求。 連鎖便利商店是服務性質的行業，第一線服務人員又是影響企業利潤及績效表現成敗的重要因素，因此了解第一線服務人員中全職及兼職員工之工作價值觀、工作滿足及組織承諾將有助於業者以正確態度管理全職及兼職員工，增加對於組織的認同感及滿足感，並進而減少員工離職率，從而增加員工在多變的環境對顧客持續提供良好服務的原動力。 本研究將以連鎖便利商店第一線服務人員，包括全職及兼職員工為研究對象，嘗試分析並瞭解目前連鎖便利商店第一線服務人員所持有的工作價值觀、工作滿足和組織承諾之差異，以及工作價值觀對工作滿足及組織承諾二者間之關聯性。經問卷調查及統計分析，本研究的主要發現如下： （ 1 ）	連鎖便利商店第一線服務人員，多為女性、未婚、 25 歲以下、高中職以下教育程度、工作年資不滿三年、以及每週工作時數少於 50 小時。 （ 2 ）	連鎖便利商店中，全職及兼職員工在工作價值觀、工作滿足及組織承諾差異並不明顯。 （ 3 ）	全職員工的婚姻狀況、平均每週工作時數會影響其工作價值觀；平均每週工作時數會影響其工作滿足；而婚姻狀況、年齡、每月平均收入、工作年資則會影響其組織承諾。在兼職員工方面，有趣的是唯有年齡會影響其工作價值觀。 （ 4 ）	全職及兼職員工工作價值觀對於工作滿足及組織承諾具有正相關。 （ 5 ）	整體而言，工作價值觀會對員工的工作滿足與組織承諾產生影響。對全職及兼職員工而言，並沒有差異。第一章	 緒緒 第一節	 研究背景與動機……………………………………………… 1 第二節	 研究目的……………………………………………………… 6 第三節	 研究流程與步驟……………………………………………… 7 第二章	 文獻探討 第一節	 連鎖便利商店………………………………………………… 8 第二節	 正職員工及兼職員工………………………………………… 15 第三節	 工作價值觀…………………………………………………… 18 第四節	 工作滿足……………………………………………………… 28 第五節	 組織承諾……………………………………………………… 39 第六節	 相關實證研究………………………………………………… 48 第三章	 研究方法 第一節	 研究架構……………………………………………………… 53 第二節	 研究假設……………………………………………………… 54 第三節	 操作型定義…………………………………………………… 55 第四節	 資料分析方法………………………………………………… 58 第五節	 研究對象……………………………………………………… 60 第六節	 測量工具……………………………………………………… 60 第七節	 問卷之因素與信度分析……………………………………… 64 第四章	 研究結果與分析 第一節	 回收樣本基本資料分析……………………………………… 69 第二節	 個人屬性與工作價值觀、工作滿足及組織承諾之 變異數分析…………………………………………………… 79 第三節	 工作價值觀、工作滿足與組織承諾間之相關分析……… 93 第四節	 工作價值觀對工作滿足及組織承諾之迴歸分析………… 97 第五章	 結論與建議 第一節	 研究結果…………………………………………………… 109 第二節	 建議………………………………………………………… 115 第三節	 研究限制與後續研究建議………………………………… 119 參考文獻 一、	中文部分……………………………………………………… 122 二、	英文部分……………………………………………………… 127 附錄 施測問...|$|R

[...] The first is <b>organizational</b> <b>commitment.</b> [...] There are {{three kinds of}} organizational commitment: [...] affective commitment, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. [...] Affective commitment, or feeling an emotional tie to one's organization, is important in employees because it demonstrates a deeper meaning for work than simply earning money.
