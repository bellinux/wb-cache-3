5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca. In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca). The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive {{to the length of}} the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight {{stays on the}} Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveyed,</b> and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.|$|E

Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> replied that the government should be responsible for relief.

5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveyed</b> felt Dunderdale {{was the best}} choice for premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was {{the best choice for}} premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election.|$|E

30|$|We {{undertook}} a content analysis {{to understand the}} aspects of teaching practices measured by each instrument included in the sample (RQ 2). Content analysis is a systematic, replicable technique for compressing text (in our case, survey items) into fewer content categories based on explicit coding rules (Berelson 1952; Krippendorff 1980; U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] 1996; Weber 1990). Content analysis enables researchers to sift through data with ease in a systematic fashion (U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] 1996) and is a useful technique for describing the focus of individuals or groups (Weber 1990); in our case, we can examine in detail the goals <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>surveying</b> the instructional practices of postsecondary instructors.

The Fernald approach targets technology end-users and their managers and directly involves them with hands-on demonstrations of new or innovative technologies during technology transfer sessions.
