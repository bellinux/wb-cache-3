5|$|<b>One</b> <b>other</b> <b>point,</b> already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
2500|$|That program {{classified}} {{the various}} types of geometry (Euclidean geometry, affine geometry, topology, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> of the space. So, [...] "rotate 30 degrees" [...] and [...] "magnify by a factor of 2" [...] are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Let me make <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> {{clear for}} the benefit of the {{millions}} in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program – we can prove it – saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat." ...|$|E

2500|$|We can {{establish}} a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} points {{on the surface of}} the sphere minus the north pole and the points in the complex plane as follows. Given a point in the plane, draw a straight line connecting it with the north pole on the sphere. That line will intersect the surface of the sphere in exactly <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point.</b> The point [...] will be projected onto the south pole of the sphere. Since the interior of the unit circle lies inside the sphere, that entire region (...) will be mapped onto the southern hemisphere. The unit circle itself (...) will be mapped onto the equator, and the exterior of the unit circle (...) will be mapped onto the northern hemisphere, minus the north pole. Clearly this procedure is reversible– given any point {{on the surface of the}} sphere that is not the north pole, we can draw a straight line connecting that point to the north pole and intersecting the flat plane in exactly one point.|$|E
2500|$|Wesley's {{attitude}} toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry" [...] {{he observed that}} a speech of Satan's in Paradise Lost is nearly equalled in Dryden's State of Innocence. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's King Arthur with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized {{as well as we}} that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the Epistle to a Friend he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit—in the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. <b>One</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> calls for comment. Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as [...] described in the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry", is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's had appeared in the essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June 1693.|$|E

5000|$|The Consumers Union {{also raises}} <b>one</b> <b>other</b> major <b>point.</b> The Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not foster {{competition}} among ILECs as the bill had hoped.

Before the 1996 Act was passed, the largest four ILECs owned {{less than half}} of all the lines in the country while, five years later, the largest four local telephone companies owned about 85% of all the lines in the country.|$|R
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>other</b> key <b>point</b> was {{the company}} had to develop new tools and hire new people when a new project came up because the {{contract}} was in a brand new research area and required different expertise.

5000|$|Love and Charlton both won the South African Formula One {{championship}} for {{six consecutive}} seasons, Love from 1964 to 1969 and Charlton from 1970 to 1975. In 1975 Ian Scheckter raced the Tyrrell 007 {{that had been}} campaigned by brother, Jody, in the previous year's world championship and won five of the seasons races, including four on the trot. However he only had <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>points</b> finish with fifth place at the False Bay [...] "100" [...] on 5 July giving him a points total for the season of 47. Charlton proved more consistent with three victories, five second positions {{to give him a}} points total for the season of 57. By winning the Natal Spring Trophy at Roy Hesketh Circuit on 1 September Charlton joined Rhodesian John Love as a six times winner of the South African National Drivers Championship. Charlton ended the South African Formula One Championship by winning the final race of the season, the Rand Spring Trophy at Kyalami on 4 October after the faster Scheckter retired with a driveshaft problem.|$|R
6000|$|There remain, however, <b>one</b> or two <b>other</b> <b>points</b> that we {{discussed}} together to which I will allude.

40|$|My talk has {{two main}} points. One is a longstanding desire for {{continentality}} by the extreme northwestern edge of our continent, {{the island of}} Eurasia. It is a tiny edge and Imperial Europe is even a tiny edge of that <b>one.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>point</b> is a desire for a self, a mastership of interpellation. To be the master of “Hey you,” which is what interpellation is. The one hailed thinks s/he is the right person. There is thus a complicity in interpellation, culturalism allows us to forget that...|$|R
60|$|One great advance, {{from the}} point of view of correctness, has been made by {{introducing}} points as they are required, and not starting, as was formerly done, by assuming the whole of space. This method is due partly to Peano, partly to another Italian named Fano. To those unaccustomed to it, it has an air of somewhat wilful pedantry. In this way, we begin with the following axioms: (1) There is a class of entities called points. (2) There is at least one point. (3) If a be a point, there is at least <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> besides a. Then we bring in the straight line joining two points, and begin again with (4), namely, on the straight line joining a and b, there is at least <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> besides a and b. (5) There is at least one point not on the line ab. And so we go on, till we have the means of obtaining as many points as we require. But the word space, as Peano humorously remarks, is one for which Geometry has no use at all.|$|E

60|$|On <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>point</b> the Editor {{thinks it}} needful to give warning: namely, {{that he is}} {{animated}} with a true though perhaps a feeble attachment to the Institutions of our Ancestors; and minded to defend these, according to ability, at all hazards; nay, it was partly {{with a view to}} such defence that he engaged in this undertaking. To stem, or if that be impossible, profitably to divert the current of Innovation, such a Volume as Teufelsdrockh's, if cunningly planted down, were no despicable pile, or floodgate, in the logical wear.|$|E
