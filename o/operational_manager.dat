25|$|On 20 October 1978 the {{generator}} failed, a regular event, {{but this time}} couldn't be restarted. The pumps failed and sea water caused the ship to capsize heavily. The crew including the captain left the ship by lifeboat. A few weeks later radio and self-taught board technician Peter Chicago returned by rubber boat attempting to repair the ship's machinery, getting the ship afloat and getting {{the generator}} and radio equipment working again, in which he achieved. Although most of the crew and the captain returned most of the DJs didn't. Sylvain Tack, the Flemish business man behind Radio Mi Amigo Internationaal, had lost interest in his project and had put the ship (of which he operated Radio Mi Amigo, but of which he lacked any ownership), the radio equipment and the project's assets in Spain on sale. The ship was regarded as an unseaworthy wreck and in fact wasn't on sale at all, alike the radio equipment, hence Ronan O'Rahilly decided to show up again as the station's <b>operational</b> <b>manager</b> and went looking for new investors to a renewed offshore radio project Caroline. An offer by Gerard van Dam to run a renewed Radio Delmare (which had lost her ship MV Aegir in September 1978) from aboard the MV Mi Amigo was turned down as plans were to broadcast 24 hours a day, which would disable any Radio Caroline broadcasts. However, Van Dam offered spare parts from the scrapped MV Aegir, including a badly needed second generator and radio transmitter spare parts.|$|E

2500|$|Southwark on {{the south}} {{bank of the river}} Thames in London was very much a cash {{generator}} in those days. (Back in the [...] sixteenth century, Southwark [...] was in many ways [...] like a prototype [...] Las Vegas.) [...] In addition to the theatres, Southwark, Bankside was also a ‘red light’ district renowned for its brothels and contained an unconsecrated graveyard for the corpses of women who had worked in them. Far from condemning the brothels, the respective bishops of Winchester, Thomas Bilson included, drew up a set of rules for their regulation and opening hours. In addition to prostitution and pick pockets, the area was also renowned for its gambling dens, skittle alleys and bear/bull baiting, most of which were run by Philip Henslowe (1550–1616) who [...] married a wealthy widow by the name of Agnes Woodward in 1579 and it is thought that with her money Henslowe had managed to acquire interests in numerous brothels, inns, lodging houses and was also involved in dyeing, starch making [...] and wood selling as well as pawnbroking, money lending and theatrical enterprises. With regard to his relationship with actors and playwrights Henslowe wrote in his diary:—“Should these fellowes come out of my debt I should have no rule over them.” Although Philip Henslowe was undoubtedly the main <b>operational</b> <b>manager</b> and entrepreneur behind many of Southwark’s and the ‘see of Winchester’s’ cash generating entertainment enterprises — all taxes from these activities had to be paid to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester. Indeed, in the London Public Record Office is an entry relating to William Shakespeare's unpaid tax, and carrying the annotation 'Ep (iscop)o Winton (ensi)' (to the Bishop of Winchester) – (*The Public Record Office, Exchequer, Lord Treasurers Remembrancer, Pipe Rolls, E.372/444, m. Dated 6 October 1600.) – which has led historians such as Ian Wilson in his 1993 book 'Shakespeare the Evidence' to surmise that perhaps William Shakespeare was living within the bishopric 'see' of Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester at this time. However somewhat curiously, William Shakespeare's name does not appear in the church wardens' annual lists of those residents registered as having attended compulsory Easter Communion. The church wardens annual lists of residents and the compulsory attendance of Easter Communion – in effect the commencement of the new year within the Julian Calendar – provided the paranoid bureaucratic authorities – fearful of Jesuit and Catholic uprisings with a detailed census as to the political status of its citizens and as a means to assess their military and tax obligations. William Shakespeare's omission from this list and the reference to Thomas Bilson the Bishop of Winchester implies 'a relationship' between these two men which has hitherto been unexplained. – Indeed, the commonality of both men being to a large extent historical enigmas is curious in itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The lack of {{management}} of the poor performance of nurses by <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> at health care institutions in Gauteng is widely reported. Studies reported that dealing with the poor performance of employees should be done incrementally {{at the first sign}} of a deviation in expected behaviour, in order to avoid the “rotten apple effect. ” The {{management of the}} poor performance of nurses has been left unaddressed by <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> for long periods in the regional hospital in Ekurhuleni, resulting in poor patients outcomes and dissatisfied service users. This happened despite the existence of legal frameworks to guide the management of the poor performance of nurses in the hospital. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe operational managers’ experiences in the management of the poor performance of nurses, in order to develop strategies for empowering the <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> to manage the poor performance of nurses in this hospital. The researcher used a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual design for this study. The population was composed of <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> employed to run the wards in the hospital. Seven participants were purposively selected from the population and consisted of the participants who voluntarily consented to participate in this study. Data was collected by means of individual semi-structured interviews. An audio-tape recorder was used with the permission of the participants to capture their responses. Tesch’s protocol of open coding was used for data analysis. Ethical principles to protect the rights of participants were adhered to and trustworthiness was ensured by using the criteria of Lincoln and Guba. Findings of the study were as follows: a central theme emerged that demonstrated that all the participants lacked knowledge and skills to manage the poor performance of nurses. Themes emerged as follows: Experiences of challenges in managing the poor performance of nurses, Emotional experiences and, Ineffective leadership practices. The themes and sub-themes were integrated with literature and relevant studies. Strategies to empower <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> to manage the poor performance were described. It is recommended that the described strategies be used in nursing practice, nursing education and for further research. Limitations and conclusion of the study are described in chapter four. M.

40|$|The roles {{played by}} {{managers}} in exercising workplace discipline {{have been of}} long-standing academic interest. However, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the way that the distinctive functions of <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> and HR practitioners may interact and shape the nature and outcomes of disciplinary procedures and processes.

It suggests that dimensions of control between <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> and HR practitioners are fundamental to understanding the nature of workplace discipline. Furthermore, it argues that this relationship is crucial in determining the prospects for a shift towards greater flexibility in the management of discipline, as called for by Gibbons and reinforced by the Employment Act 2008.

40|$|Abstract: Technology {{plays an}} {{important}} role in company competitiveness and, like any other sources of competition, needs to be managed based on a strategic point of view. Therefore, how technology is selected and prioritised is integral to support the company strategic objective. The information characteristics of strategic decisions are that they are ad hoc, forward looking, external and wide scoped. In addition, new technology is filled with uncertainties. <b>Operational</b> <b>managers</b> at lower levels make day-to-day decisions that are structured and information is easily available, inward looking and certain. However, from time to time they have to make technology decisions, which are unstructured in nature, or make recommendations to senior management about the technology. This creates a problem as the <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> usually make structured decisions. If a decision-making process guideline is available to be utilised during technology rollout decisions, which are unstructured in nature, it will provide decision makers at operational management level with a structure and help decision makers to make decisions that are effective. To derive a decision-making process guideline, this study made use of two case studies within one organisation to determine how previous technology decisions were taken and what factors were taken into account. In both cases, the recommendations by the <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> were overruled by the senior executives. The case study method was used as it provided the researcher with in-depth knowledge of how decisions were taken. It was found that the company had a high-level process of making decisions which consisted of a white paper generated by <b>operational</b> <b>managers</b> making recommendations on whether the technology should be implemented or not. A PowerPoint presentation was prepared summarising the white paper and presented to the senior executives to ratify the recommendations. It was also found that there was no standard process of generating the white paper and Power- Point presentation and as a result there were inconsistencies in how the information was gathered and presented. Based on the literature review and case study findings, a recommended decision-making process guideline was derived. M. Phil. (Engineering Management...|$|R
