5|$|The main {{goals of}} the terror was to destroy the power {{structure}} of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political violence as a military weapon. The terror achieved some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives,</b> but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> {{that had been}} given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{optimization}} problem which only measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function are available, {{it is difficult}} or impossible to directly obtain <b>the</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function. Although <b>the</b> second order simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (2 SPSA) algorithm solves this problem successfully by efficient gradient approximation that relies on measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function, <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm depends on <b>the</b> matrix conditioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function Hessian. In order to eliminate the influence caused by <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function Hessian, this paper uses nonlinear conjugate gradient method to decide <b>the</b> search direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function. By synthesizing different nonlinear conjugate gradient methods, it ensures each search direction to b...|$|R

5|$|In the Gospić Corps AOR, the 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade {{began an}} eastward {{attack in the}} Mala Kapela area in the morning, meeting heavy {{resistance}} from the ARSK 70th Infantry Brigade. The rest of the 1st Guards joined in around midnight. The 133rd Home Guard Regiment attacked east of Otočac, towards Vrhovine, attempting to encircle the ARSK 50th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 103rd Infantry Brigade in a pincer movement. Even though the regiment advanced, it failed to achieve its objective for the day. On the regiment's right flank, the HV 128th Brigade advanced together with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Home Guard Regiment and cut through the VrhovineKorenica road. The rest of the 9th Guards Brigade, {{the bulk of the}} HV 118th Home Guard Regiment and the 111th Infantry Brigade advanced east from Gospić and Lički Osik, coming up against very strong resistance from the ARSK 18th Infantry Brigade. As a result of these setbacks, the Gospić Corps ended the day short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> it had been given.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles {{had their}} {{origins in the}} Indian {{independence}} movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed {{an important part of}} the Indian independence movement, with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was a {{successful}} large-scale airborne operation. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> that the airborne troops of the 17th had been tasked with had been captured and held, usually within {{only a few hours}} of the operation's beginning. The bridges over the Issel had been successfully captured, although one later had to be destroyed to prevent its capture by counter-attacking German forces. The Diersfordter Forest had been cleared of enemy troops, and the roads along which the Germans might have moved reinforcements against the advance had been cut by airborne troops. By nightfall of the 24th, the British 15th Infantry Division had joined up with elements of the British 6th Airborne Division, and by midnight the first light bridge was across the Rhine. By the 27th, twelve bridges suitable for heavy armour had been installed over the Rhine and the Allies had fourteen divisions on the east bank of the river which had penetrated up to ten miles. The division also gained its fourth Medal of Honor in the days following Operation Varsity, when Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick of the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment received the award posthumously after aiding in the capture of Lembeck Castle, which had been turned into a fortified position by the Germans. In terms of casualties, the 17th Airborne Division suffered a total of 1,346 casualties in the space of five days, between 24 and 29 March, when Operation Plunder came to an end. After it had participated in Operation Varsity, the 17th Airborne Division continued to advance through Germany as a part of XVIII Airborne Corps, engaging German forces around Wesel, Essen and Münster. When Germany unconditionally surrendered on 7 May 1945, the division was conducting occupation duties in northern Germany.|$|E
