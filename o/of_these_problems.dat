5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms.

5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> were {{considered}} to be well understood, and a much larger design emerged, NIF. NIF was designed to provide about twice the required driver energy, allowing some margin of error. NIF's design was finalized in 1994, with construction to be completed by 2002. Construction began in 1997 but took over a decade to complete, with major construction being declared complete in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Andrew Strominger {{published}} a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions {{might have an}} equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical {{issues related to the}} quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Commission on Human Rights {{came under}} fire during its {{existence}} for the high-profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee {{the human rights of}} their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{management}} and emergency response often involves the joint cooperation {{of a network}} of distributed problem solvers, each of which maybe specialised for a specific task or <b>problem</b> domain. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problem</b> solvers could be human, others could be `intelligent' environmental monitoring and control systems. Environmental software systems are needed not only for the provision of basic environmental information but also to support the coordination <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problem</b> solvers. An agent architecture can support the requirement associated with disparate problem solvers. The various stakeholders in the process are represented by software agents which can collaborate with each other toward achieving a particular goal. The communication between agents can be accomplished by using interaction protocols which are represented by coloured Petri nets (CPN). This paper describes an approach for providing this support by employing a software agent framework for the modelling and execution of environmental process tasks in a networked environment...|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} is generally poor due to high temperatures, sedimentation, and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> are created by human activity; forests and riparian zones have been cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, and high road densities cause slope failures. Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape, leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream. Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed, reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread. Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion. Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries, sometimes {{to such an extent that}} the mouth is left nearly dry.|$|E
5|$|There were {{frequent}} {{fires and}} maintenance {{problems on the}} Jamaica Bay viaduct. The most notorious <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> was a fire in May 1950 between The Raunt and Broad Channel Stations. After this fire, the LIRR abandoned the Jamaica Bay viaduct and the Queens portion of the Rockaway Beach/Far Rockaway route. On June 11, 1952, the city acquired all trackage west of Mott Avenue, incorporating {{it as part of}} the IND Rockaway Line. Service provided by the A train over the line began in June 1956, with the full western spur to Rockaway Park operational. While the remainder of the line operated, with Beach 25th Street–Wavecrest serving as the eastern spur terminal, a new Far Rockaway subway station was constructed, opening on January 16, 1958.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{confluence}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health {{during the spring}} of 1871. Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer from The New York Times to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 ($ in 2016), accepted Secretary Columbus Delano's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871. The appointment was simultaneously a go-around to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor. Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication of the Statistical Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census. The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
