5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} <b>of</b> <b>race</b> {{was informed}} {{by her own}} mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme <b>of</b> <b>race</b> within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships.

5|$|In 1981, the MCA {{assessed}} the NEP {{and other government}} policies from a Chinese point of view. Its findings expressed concern {{over a number of}} problems, including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay-dominated civil service, claiming the NEP's goal of eradicating identification <b>of</b> <b>race</b> with economic function had been abrogated. In addition, it was argued that non-Malays were under-represented in Parliament and the Cabinet because of gerrymandering; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies, despite the total population of urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones. However, UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA over the issue.|$|E
40|$|Variability in {{aggressiveness}} was {{studied in}} seven Plasmopara halstedii (sunflower downy mildew) parental isolates <b>of</b> <b>races</b> 100, 300, 304, 314, 704, 710 and 714 using five single zoosporangium isolates per parental isolate.

Analysis of five single zoosporangium isolates of each parental isolate showed variability within parental isolate for the two aggressiveness criteria, but not for all parental isolates. The parental isolates <b>of</b> <b>races</b> 100, 300, 304 and 314 had a shorter latent period and greater sporulation density than the parental isolates <b>of</b> <b>races</b> 710, 704 and 714.
