Two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> necessary because of the Munich Agreement, the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans. Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he {{got home from work}} one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

40|$|It <b>is</b> {{surprisingly}} hard <b>to</b> define presentism. Traditional {{definitions of}} the view, in terms of tensed existence statements, have turned <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> capable of convincingly distinguishing presentism from eternalism. Picking up on a recent proposal by Tallant, I suggest {{that we need to}} locate the break between eternalism and presentism on a much more fundamental level. The problem is that presentists have tried to express their view within a framework that is inherently eternalist. I call that framework the Fregean nexus, as it is defined by Frege’s atemporal understanding of predication. In particular, I show that the tense-logical understanding of tense which is treated as common ground in the debate rests on this very same Fregean nexus, and is thus inadequate for a proper definition of presentism. I contrast the Fregean nexus with what I call the original temporal nexus, which is based on an alternative, inherently temporal form of predication. Finally, I propose to define presentism in terms of the original temporal nexus, yielding original presentism. According to original presentism, temporal propositions are distinguished from atemporal ones not by aspects of their content, as they are on views based on the Fregean nexus, but by their form—in particular, by their form of predication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{principal}} {{aim of this}} paper <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{shed some light on}} the algebraic content of the Tratado da arte de arismetica by Bento Fernandes, which was published in Porto in 1555 and is the earliest treatise of a Portuguese author that has come down to us in which algebra is studied. Since it therefore constitutes an important testimony of the state of development of algebra in Portugal {{in the middle of the}} 16 th century, it deserves special attention. At a time when Pacioli's Summa, the first printed text that includes algebraic methods, was already so diffuse, it is surprising that it turns <b>out</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> the source of the algebraic material of Bento Fernandes. The comparative study I have carried out between the Tratado da arte de arismetica and a number of abacus books from the 14 th and the 15 th centuries shows that Bento Fernandes's algebra had its origin in abacus manuscripts antedating the Summa...|$|R
