[...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E

The evaluative language of eight aphasic speakers and eight normal speakers were compared using the Cinderella story re-tell task. The Appraisal framework was used to assess the use of attitude (Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation) to convey opinions and feelings. Evaluations were also coded for valence (positive or negative) and cognitive representation (abstract or concrete terms). The role of personal style, mood, interest or situation, and gender as well as factors of age and education was considered. The findings of this study, which corroborate Armstrong’s (2005) research, indicate that while aphasic speakers use significantly fewer evaluations than normal speakers, they use the different types of evaluation considered in this study in a similar manner as normal speakers. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of previous research. ...|$|R
