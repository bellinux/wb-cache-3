5000|$|The {{most common}} example of {{roasting}} is the oxidation of metal sulfide ores. The metal sulfide is heated {{in the presence}} of air to a temperature that allows the oxygen in the air to react with the sulfide to form sulfur dioxide gas and solid metal oxide. The solid product from roasting is often called [...] "calcine." [...] In <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting,</b> if the temperature and gas conditions are such that the sulfide feed is completely oxidized, the process is known as [...] "dead roasting." [...] Sometimes, {{as in the case of}} pre-treating reverberatory or electric smelting furnace feed, the roasting process is performed with less than the required amount of oxygen to fully oxidize the feed. In this case, the process is called [...] "partial roasting," [...] because the sulfur is only partially removed. Finally, if the temperature and gas conditions are controlled such that the sulfides in the feed react to form metal sulfates instead of metal oxides, the process is known as [...] "sulfation roasting." [...] Sometimes, temperature and gas conditions can be maintained such that a mixed sulfide feed (for instance a feed containing both copper sulfide and iron sulfide) reacts such that one metal forms a sulfate and the other forms an oxide, the process is known as [...] "selective roasting" [...] or [...] "selective sulfation." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Located on {{the eastern}} shores of South Africa, 180 km north of Durban, Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) {{produces}} approximately 2. 0 million metric tonnes of product annually making RBM a leading producer of titania slag, high purity pig iron, rutile and zircon. Heavy minerals are extracted from the nearby dunes by dredging and concentration on a floating gravity separation plant, followed by separation of the ilmenite, rutile and zircon at the mineral separation plant located at the smelter site. The ilmenite is processed through an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roast</b> followed by magnetic separation and is then partially reduced to an 85 per cent TiO 2 slag in one of four six-in-line a. c. electric arc furnaces. The slag is milled and then classified into two product sizes suitable as a raw material for both the sulphate and chloride pigment processes. The high quality iron produced during the reduction process is further processed to produce various grades of low-manganese iron. Around 95 per cent of the products are exported, yielding a world market share of about 25 per cent of titania slag, rutile, high quality pig iron, and zircon...|$|R

In order to recover titanium and chromium from the raw concentrate which was separated from the Promenade deposit, Gaza province, Mozambique, an innovative technology using modification of magnetic property followed by magnetic separation was proposed. Magnetic property, phase and surface morphology of the sample before and after <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting</b> were firstly characterized by magnetism, chemistry, XRD and MLA analyses to interpret the mechanism of <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting</b> of the ilmenite. Then, these factors such as <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting</b> temperature, residence time and magnetic induction affecting on magnetic separation performance were examined and the optimum process parameters were determined. A commercial concentrate containing 47. 94 % TiO 2 and 0. 23 % Cr 2 O 3 was obtained and the recovery of TiO 2 and Cr 2 O 3 was 78. 52 % and 5. 42 %, respectively. The tailing obtained was preliminarily concentrated by a high-intensity magnetic separator and a rough chromite concentrate was gained. In order to further purify the rough one, reducing roasting was carried out to transform the minerals containing hematite into the minerals containing magnetite, followed by a low-intensity magnetic separation. The effects of these parameters such as temperature, carbon powder dosage, holding time and magnetic induction on magnetic separation performance were investigated and the optimal conditions were determined. A concentrate containing 28. 65 % Cr 2 O 3 was obtained and the total recovery of Cr 2 O 3 was 84. 18 %. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|Flavor lexicons {{are used}} in sensory {{evaluation}} to determine the flavor profile of a food product. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a flavor lexicon for cooked beef, which can then be used in various projects relating to beef quality such as studies investigating animal diet, marinating, ageing, or other enhancements. A descriptive panel of 10 people was used to develop a flavor lexicon of 18 attributes, including astringent, barny, bloody, brothy, browned, gamey, grassy, juicy, fatty, livery, metallic, <b>oxidized,</b> <b>roast</b> beef, and the five basic tastes (bitter, salty, sour, sweet, and umami). In contrast to other studies on beef, this lexicon was developed to include both positive and negative attributes. The lexicon was able to show that rib eye steaks from the Longissimus dorsi muscle in grass-fed animals were significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) higher in barny, bitter, gamey, and grassy flavors, and lower in juicy and umami flavors. The steaks were also rated by consumers, who showed a preference for grain-fed beef over grass-fed beef. The ratings of the descriptive panel were related to the consumer panel scores to equate the lexicon terms with a positive or negative consumer degree of liking score. Those terms that were considered positive in this study due to their positive correlation with consumer liking include brothy, umami, roast beef, juicy, browned, fatty, and salty. The terms that were inversely associated with consumer liking were barny, bitter, gamey and grassy, among others. A separate descriptive panel was conducted on the Spinalis dorsi (or “cap” muscle) of the rib eye steak, with similar results. Additionally, descriptive and consumer evaluations found no difference between two types of grass diets, namely alfalfa and sainfoin. Different mixtures of beef and chicken were also evaluated to determine flavor differences between the two meats. Chicken was found to be more closely correlated to brothy, juicy, sweet, and umami, among others, while beef was found to be more closely correlated to terms such as gamey, bloody, <b>oxidized,</b> metallic, <b>roast</b> beef, and astringent.

50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first <b>oxidized</b> through <b>roasting</b> or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc furnace (electrothermic reactor). Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve pyrometallurgy, but chemical processes like hydrometallurgy and electrometallurgy are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} effect of sodium {{hydroxide}} and sodium carbonate used as additives during <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting</b> of oolitic limonite iron concentrate and more precisely upon the change in its magnetic susceptibility. Further, the efficiency of Alkali Roast Acid Leach (ARAL) technology for dephosphorisation of the concentrate is compared with the case when sodium hydroxide was added in alkali leach after roasting. The treatment without additives in roasting resulted in obtaining iron concentrate with 58 % iron and 0. 21 % phosphorus, while the ARAL approach yielded concentrate with 63 % iron and 0. 09 % phosphorus. The influence of combination of coke as reducing agent and sodium hydroxide in roasting at 900 °C is also investigated and results displayed in 3 D form. The combination of ARAL with reductive roasting, grinding of the clinker to 80 % - 0, 075 mm, flotation of the non-reacted coke and magnetic separation {{before and after the}} acid leach resulted in iron concentrate with 66 % iron and 0. 05 % phosphorus. The study has shown that the application of the ARAL approach with low addition of alkalis followed by 10 to 15 minute acid leaching at ambient temperature could substantially reduce phosphorus, thus offering the possibility for efficient treatment of high phosphorus iron ores.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{leaching}} efficiency of vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) from stone coal and to reduce its connected environmental pollution, this article investigated the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>roasting</b> of stone coal in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor to optimize the roasting method and conditions. The examined parameters included reaction temperature, reaction time and amount and mixing method of additive. The removal of Cl from the generated effluent gas was implemented using CaO as the adsorbent, and comparison was made between the fluidized bed roasting and static roasting in a muffle oven. The {{results show that the}} fluidized roasting is more favorable to leach V 2 O 5 from stone coal, which can shorten roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, while the realized leaching rate is also higher. Comparing the mixing method applied to stone coal and additive, the impregnation method of additive on stone coal not only increased the leaching rate and shortened the roasting time for reaching the maximal leaching rate, but also reduced the amount of additive required. Adding CaO in stone coal roasting sharply decreased the content of Cl-containing gases in flue gas, which can greatly alleviate the possible environmental pollution. The optimal conditions for fluidized bed roasting were found to be impregnating 6 wt. % additive on coal, adding 3 wt. % CaO and performing roasting at 800 degrees C for 0. 75 h.

40|$|Zincor, a zinc {{refinery}} in South Africa, uses {{oxygen enrichment}} {{of up to}} 26 % O 2 in its fluidizing air to increase concentrate-throughput in its fluidized bed roasters. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine whether O 2 enrichment can be reduced by introducing micropelletized concentrate into the feed blend, while maintaining concentrate throughput rates and calcine quality. A laboratory scale fluidized roaster was used to determine the strength and oxidation kinetics of suitable micro-pellets. The strength of the pellets was determined by the extent of attrition during roasting. It was found that micro-pelletization decreases the fines in the feed to the roasters; the – 500 μm fraction decreased from 87 % to 10 %. The micro-pelletized particles do break down during roasting, which increases the - 500 μm fraction to 31 %. The general morphologies of the roasted particles are similar to those found by previous workers. Micro-pelletized concentrate particles require more time than nonpelletized concentrate particles to <b>oxidize</b> in the <b>roasting</b> step, although this is less than the mean residence time of the Zincor roasters.

40|$|Four {{sulphide}} minerals – pyrite (FeS 2), pyrrhotite (Fe 1 –xS), pentlandite ([Ni,Fe] 9 S 8), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) – {{contain the}} base metals {{and most of}} the iron in concentrates of platinum group metals (PGMs). In the pyrometallurgical processing of PGM concentrates these sulphides form a matte during smelting, and iron and sulphur are removed from the matte during the converting process. This paper discusses the roasting of Merensky concentrate in air before smelting, with the purpose of reducing the matte load to the converter. Roasting tests were conducted in a bench-scale rotary kiln at temperatures from 350 °C to 700 °C. The concentrate tested contained 17. 4 % sulphur and consisted of 23 % pyrrhotite, 16 % pentlandite, 11 % chalcopyrite, and 2 % pyrite. The particles were fine (d 50 = 22 μm), and all the sulphide particles were liberated. Roasting in air at 550 °C and 650 °C for 20 minutes removed respectively 60 % and 70 % of the sulphur. The iron in the sulphides was oxidized to Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) at temperatures below 500 ⁰C and to Fe 2 O 3 (haematite) at temperatures above 550 ⁰C. At 700 ⁰C the bed sintered and copper oxides formed. At temperatures below 450 °C oxidation was incomplete: pyrrhotite remained and only 30 % of the sulphur was removed. Smelting tests were conducted to assess matte fall and the deportment of copper and nickel to matte. It was evident that roasting resulted in lower matte falls (a drop of approximately 60 %) compared with matte falls from unroasted concentrate. The iron and sulphur levels in the matte were reduced to below 3. 5 % and 22 % respectively. This paper also briefly describes the mechanisms by which pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite are <b>oxidized</b> during <b>roasting.</b> For chalcopyrite, the mechanism proceeds through an intermediate solid solution phase, which extends from Cu 1. 02 Fe 1. 04 S 2 to Cu 2. 04 Fe 0. 72 S 2 to a copper-rich solid solution of bornite (Cu 4 Fe 1. 4 S 4 –Cu 2 S). The oxidation of pentlandite proceeds through a monosulphide solid solution (Ni 0. 39 Fe 0. 53 S–Ni 0. 74 Fe 0. 15 S) to a solid solution of heazlewoodite ([Ni,Fe] 3 ±xS 2). These mechanisms are explored in relation to chemical thermodynamics and microstructures. This paper was first presented at the, Platinum Conference 2014, 20 – 24 October 2014, Sun City South Africa.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to use a meat flavor lexicon to identify and quantify flavor differences among different types of meats such as beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and turkey, and to identify and quantify specific flavor attributes associated with “beef flavor” notes. A trained descriptive panel with 11 participants used a previously developed meat lexicon composed of 18 terms to evaluate the flavor of beef, chicken, pork, turkey, and lamb samples. Results show that beef and lamb samples can be described by flavor attributes such as barny, bitter, gamey, grassy, livery, metallic, and roast beef. Inversely related to these samples were pork and turkey and those attributes that were closely related to them, namely brothy, fatty, salty, sweet, and umami. Chicken was not strongly related to the other types of meats or the attributes used. The descriptive panel also evaluated samples of ground beef mixed with chicken to identify and quantify flavor attributes associated with a “beef flavor. ” Meat patties for this portion consisted of ground beef mixed with ground chicken in varying amounts: 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % beef, with the remainder made up of chicken. Beef and beef-rich patties (75 % beef) were more closely related to flavor attributes such as astringent, bloody, fatty, gamey, metallic, livery, <b>oxidized,</b> grassy, and <b>roast</b> beef, while chicken was more closely associated with brothy, juicy, sour, sweet, and umami.
