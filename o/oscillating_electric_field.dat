2500|$|An {{electromagnetic}} wave such as light {{consists of a}} coupled <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> and magnetic field which are always perpendicular; by convention, the [...] "polarization" [...] of {{electromagnetic wave}}s refers to {{the direction of the}} electric field. [...] In linear polarization, the fields oscillate in a single direction. [...] In circular or elliptical polarization, the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels. [...] The rotation can have two possible directions; if the fields rotate in a right hand sense with respect to the direction of wave travel, it is called right circular polarization, or, if the fields rotate in a left hand sense, it is called left circular polarization.|$|E
2500|$|In {{capacitive}} coupling (electrostatic induction), the conjugate of inductive coupling, {{energy is transmitted}} by electric fields between electrodes such as metal plates. [...] The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric. [...] An alternating voltage generated by the transmitter {{is applied to the}} transmitting plate, and the <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> induces an alternating potential on the receiver plate by electrostatic induction, which causes an alternating current to flow in the load circuit. [...] The amount of power transferred increases with the frequency the square of the voltage, and the capacitance between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and (for short distances) inversely proportional to the separation.|$|E
2500|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} (pronounced [...] ), {{named after}} the British physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), is the (dominantly) elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of the radiation. Rayleigh scattering does not change the state of material and is, hence, a parametric process. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules. It can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases. Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. The <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency. The particle therefore becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light.|$|E

2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance mass spectrometry {{is a type of}} mass analyzer (or mass spectrometer) for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions are trapped in a Penning trap (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a [...] "packet" [...] of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electrons}} then {{pass through}} a second cavity, called the [...] "catcher", through a similar pair of grids {{on each side of}} the cavity. [...] The function of the catcher grids is to absorb energy from the electron beam. [...] The bunches of electrons passing through excite standing waves in the cavity, which has the same resonant frequency as the buncher cavity. [...] Each bunch of electrons passes between the grids at a point in the cycle when the exit grid is negative with respect to the entrance grid, so the electric field in the cavity between the grids opposes the electrons motion. [...] The electrons thus do work on the electric field, and are decelerated, their kinetic energy is converted to electric potential energy, increasing the amplitude of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the cavity. [...] Thus the oscillating field in the catcher cavity is an amplified copy of the signal applied to the buncher cavity. [...] The amplified signal is extracted from the catcher cavity through a coaxial cable or waveguide.|$|E
2500|$|The spiral {{path of the}} {{cyclotron}} beam {{can only}} [...] "sync up" [...] with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying Newton's laws of motion. If the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent {{of the speed of}} light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the isochronous cyclotrons, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the synchrocyclotrons, either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern, klystron-driven linear accelerators, both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.|$|E

Paul traps are commonly used as a components of a mass spectrometer. The invention of the 3D quadrupole ion trap itself is attributed to Wolfgang Paul who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for this work.

2500|$|Tesla {{invented the}} Tesla coil during {{efforts to develop}} a [...] "wireless" [...] {{lighting}} system, with gas discharge light bulbs that would glow in an <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> from a high voltage, high frequency power source. [...] For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil (induction coil) with his high frequency alternator. [...] He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. [...] To fix this problem Tesla changed the design {{so that there was}} an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil [...] He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. [...] Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies. He found that the highest voltages were generated when the [...] "closed" [...] primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the [...] "open" [...] secondary winding.|$|E

The <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> of a laser (or any time dependent signal) can be represented by a sum of sinusoidal signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier series. The <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> of a coherent, continuous-wave (cw) laser is represented as a single narrow peak in the frequency domain representation. If the laser is amplitude-modulated to produce a stable train of very short pulses (usually through mode-locking), the equivalent frequency domain representation is a series of narrow frequency peaks centered around the laser's original cw frequency. These frequency peaks are separated by the frequency of the time domain pulses. This is called the repetition rate of the frequency comb.|$|E

40|$|Many {{pulsating}} phenomena {{are associated}} with the auroral substorm. It has been considered that some of these phenomena involve kilometer-scale Alfvén waves coupling the magnetosphere and ionosphere. <b>Electric</b> <b>field</b> oscillations at the altitude of the ionosphere are a signature of such wave activity that could distinguish it from other sources of auroral particle precipitation, which may be simply tracers of magnetospheric activity. Therefore, a ground based diagnostic of kilometer-scale <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> would be a valuable tool in the study of pulsations and the auroral substorm. In this study we attempt to develop such a tool in the Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar (PFISR). The central result is a statistically significant detection of a 1. 4 Hz <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> oscillation associated with a similar oscillating optical emission, during the recovery phase of a substorm. The optical emissions also contain a bright, lower frequency (0. 2 Hz) pulsation that does not show up in the radar backscatter. The fact that higher frequency oscillations are detected by the radar, whereas the bright, lower frequency optical pulsation is not detected by the radar, serves to strengthen a theoretical argument that the radar is sensitive to <b>oscillating</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> but not to oscillating particle precipitation. Although it is difficult to make conclusions as to the physical mechanism, we do not find evidence for a plane-wave-like Alfvén wave; the detected structure is evident in only two of five adjacent beams.
