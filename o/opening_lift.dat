The resort was the second resort to open a gondola in Colorado, after Vail Ski Resort opened theirs in 1962.

Despite this limitation, the variator is a relatively simple device to add to an existing engine and so they remain in service today.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Our primary {{objective}} {{in this study}} is to compare the effects of the applications of desflurane and remifentanyl anaesthesia, along with lumbar epidural analgesia combined with desflurane on postoperative recovery in the cases who undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Methods: This study performed 240 patients who undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery. Patients were divided into two random groups as Group DR (desflurane + remifentanyl n= 120) and Group DL (desflurane +Lumbar Epidural Analgesia n= 120). The general anaesthesia in Group DR was performed through the use of desflurane and remifentanyl. Group DL was administered a general anaesthesia through a pre-operative epidural catheter insertion and an application of desflurane. Extubation, eye <b>opening,</b> head <b>lift</b> for 5 seconds, and the surgical durations of the patients as well as the postoperative side-effects were recorded. Modified Aldrete Scoring System was used to assess the recovery of the patients from anaesthesia. Results: According to the inter group comparison results between Group DR and Group DL, the duration of extubation, eye <b>opening,</b> head <b>lift</b> for 5 seconds and the average amount of elapsed time until the modified Aldrete Scoring reached 10 were found statistically and significantly shorter in Group DL than Group DR(respectively p= 0. 002, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001, p< 0. 001). The duration of the first analgesic need was statistically and significantly longer in Group DL compared to Group DR (p< 0. 001). The postoperative patient satisfaction in Group DL was statistically and significantly higher than that in Group DR (p= 0. 010). Conclusion: The Epidural analgesia included in the general anaesthesia in lower abdominal surgery is considered by us to be the beneficial and efficient method of analgesia which leads to an earlier recovery of the patients without affecting the intraoperative hemodynamic stability and which boosts the patient satisfaction by providing a more efficient analgesia during the postoperative period...|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Breckenridge {{expanded}} to Peak 10, with the <b>opening</b> of <b>Lift</b> F, a Poma fixed grip quad. A year later, it was upgraded {{to a high}} speed quad and renamed the Falcon SuperChair. Runs on Peak 10 were named by mountain manager Jim Gill after World War II planes, like Crystal, Cimarron, Doublejack and Mustang. Also in 1986, the Colorado SuperChair was built on Peak 8, replacing Lift 1. The replacement lift ran a different alignment from its predecessor, running up {{the south side of}} Spruce and ending at the Vista Haus. With the addition of both the Colorado SuperChair and the Falcon SuperChair, each open peak had one high speed quad on it. All chairlifts built at Breckenridge since these two lifts have been built by Poma, or its successor, Leitner-Poma.|$|R

40|$|Submitted to Humanoids 2017 International audienceWe {{propose a}} multi-robot {{quadratic}} program (QP) controller for retargeting of a human's multi-contact loco-manipulation motions to a humanoid robot. Using this framework, the robot can track complex motions and automatically adapt to {{objects in the}} environment that have different physical properties from those {{that were used to}} provide the human's reference motion. The whole-body multi-contact manipulation problem is formulated as a multi-robot QP, which optimizes over the combined dynamics of the robot and any manipulated objects. The multi-robot QP maintains a dynamic partition of the robot's tracking links into fixed support contact, manipulation contact, and contact-free tracking links, which are re-partitioned and re-instantiated as constraints in the multi-robot QP every time a contact event occurs in the human motion. We present various experiments (bag retrieval, door <b>opening,</b> box <b>lifting)</b> using human motion data from an Xsens inertial motion capture system.

50|$|Because the {{development}} of delinquency in youth is influenced by numerous factors, prevention efforts need to be comprehensive in scope. Prevention services may include activities such as substance abuse education and treatment, family counseling, youth mentoring, parenting education, educational support, and youth sheltering.

40|$|Abstract—All {{industries}} like oil-refineries, petrochemicals, chemical {{industries and}} heavy industries (metal) etc are causing tremendous pollution {{to the nature}} and its environments i. e. air, water, soil. Presently the residue materials from these industries are either liberated in open air or burnt in open air through <b>openings</b> of high <b>lifted</b> chimney. In both the cases, the residue materials are causing environmental pollution and spreading huge number of diseases in animals and botanic life including human one. In this paper, I propose an inventive environmental pollution control and prevention system for complete destruction the residue materials. The outcoming residue in gaseous form are passed through U or V-shaped zigzag pipes filled either water or oils and thereafter through freezing chamber and are finally burnt in a closed chamber with supply of oxygen. By this, maximum utilization regarding raw materials of these industries is achieved also. Hence, this method facilitates pure ecological balance system as well as highest enrich goals of the industries all over the globe...|$|R
