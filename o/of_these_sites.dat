5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>sites</b> being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} at one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>sites</b> increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen {{that would otherwise be}} delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E

5|$|From around 2000 to 800BC, {{the people}} of the Bronze Age built the 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows that are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds. These are found both in {{isolation}} and grouped together to form cemeteries. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>sites</b> can still be seen as prominent features in the present-day landscape. By the later Bronze Age, an open, cleared, landscape predominated on the Wolds. It was used for grazing and also for arable cultivation. The wetlands {{on either side of the}} Wolds in the River Hull valley, Holderness and the Vale of York were also being used for animal rearing at this time. In the Iron Age there were further cultural changes in the area. There emerged a distinctive local tradition known as the Arras Culture, named after a site at Arras, near Market Weighton. There are similarities between the chariot burials of the Arras Culture and groups of La Tene burials in northern Europe, where the burial of carts was also practised. The area became the kingdom of the tribe known as the Parisi.|$|E

30|$|While the second-order {{interactions}} are still largely conjectural, {{there appear to}} be synergistic effects between, soil fertility and exposure (both site factors), and genotype, <b>these</b> <b>site</b> factors often amplifying the expression of genotypic differences. Returning to the case of long-internode genotypes showing very poor tree form on sites that are very fertile and/or exposed, low stockings will almost certainly have a synergistic effect, making the situation even worse. A similar synergism likely involves poor wood stiffness (and longitudinal shrinkage), also at low stockings on sites that are very fertile and/or exposed. In such cases, expression of genotypic differences may be amplified, in LoE interaction, by <b>these</b> <b>site</b> and silviculture factors. However, if a combination <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>site</b> and silviculture factors means that all genotypes cause almost uniformly disastrous tree form, there would be LoE interaction suppressing effective expression of genotypic differences.|$|R
