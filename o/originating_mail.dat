50|$|The Emoze technology, called Smart Routing was {{designed}} to provide a seamless and secure messaging for the end users. Data are constantly synchronized, in real-time, only when the mobile device is on and connected to the Internet. The user's privacy is protected and secured by enabling messages to be pushed from the <b>originating</b> <b>mail</b> server to the mobile device without storing it on an intermediate server. Private data are not being stored on a third party server, thus avoiding data loss and corruption. Whenever there is a new event (email, contact or calendar) on the mail server or mobile device, the synchronization is processed immediately.|$|E
50|$|Remote Bar Coding System (RBCS), {{also called}} Remote Video Encoding (RVE) {{is a method}} used by the United States Postal Service to encode the address of letter-sized mailpieces that are not decipherable by a Multiline Optical Character Reader (MLOCR). When an MLOCR does not {{recognize}} a valid address on a letter, (usually due to hand-written addressing) it sends {{an image of the}} mailpiece to a central RBCS (RVE) site where more sophisticated optical character recognition software is able to interpret many hand-written addresses using neural net and fuzzy logic algorithms. If this does not succeed, human operators visually examine the image and enter the address. In both cases, the data is sent back to the <b>originating</b> <b>mail</b> facility where mailpieces are then automatically matched back up with data {{through the use of a}} unique fluorescent barcode printed on the back during initial MLOCR attempt, and receive a POSTNET barcode representing the full address.|$|E
50|$|From 1982 to 1985 Electronic Computer <b>Originated</b> <b>Mail,</b> {{known as}} E-COM was {{accepted}} for bulk mailings.

50|$|E-COM, {{short for}} Electronic Computer <b>Originated</b> <b>Mail,</b> was a hybrid mail process used from 1982 to 1985 by the U.S. Postal Service to print {{electronically}} <b>originated</b> <b>mail,</b> and deliver it in envelopes to customers {{within two days}} of transmission. The E-COM service allowed customers to transmit messages of up to two pages from their own computers, via telecommunication lines, {{to one or more}} of 25 serving post offices (SPOs) located in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. After an electronic message was received as a SPO, it was processed and sorted by ZIP Code, then printed on letter-size bond paper, folded, and sealed in an envelope printed with a blue E-COM logo. In order to be eligible for the service, customers were required to send a minimum of 200 messages per transmission.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} extent to which members' {{assessment}} of their cooperatives' degree of success is related to various member attributes, notably the members' perception of their participation in the governance of the cooperatives. Three categories of member attributes are identified: satisfaction with the profitability of farm operations, age of the member, and experience from board work. The cooperatives' degree of success is measured as members' commitment towards cooperatives, and members' trust in the board of directors. The data <b>originate</b> from a <b>mail</b> survey among 2, 250 Swedish farmers. The results indicate differences in members' commitment and their trust towards directors to be due to farm profitability, the members' age and experience as directors. After adding members' perception of their participation in the governance as a covariate, most of the other differences are explained by this variable. Age is still partly associated with trust towards directors; older farmers have less trust. [EconLit Classifications: Q 13, D 23, D 72 ]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R

We are developing mining tool for extracting the information from data <b>originated</b> in profession-specific <b>mailing</b> lists. Offers in the mailing lists come in html, rtf or plain text format. The messages are written in common spoken language. We have developed the system so it will use text mining methods to extract the information and save it structured form. Then {{we will be able}} to work with it. We are examining how user handles the mail and apply the knowledge in the development. We solve the problems with obtaining of the messages, distinguishing language and encoding and estimating the type of message. After recognition of the transported information we are able to mine data.

40|$|Abstract:- With {{the advent}} of e-mail, {{sensitive}} information leakage has become a daunting problem in today's world. Quite often, the mail volume from a company is huge, making manual monitoring impossible. Automatic screening mostly relies {{on the idea of}} content scanning, but sometimes the information is so sensitive that even scanning the mails by a third party may not be permitted. Detection under such restrictions becomes difficult. Also, <b>mails</b> <b>originating</b> from specific organizations are often restricted in their subject and content, suggesting that powerful generic techniques like content scanning may not be needed. We propose that selection of proper input variables relevant to the domain could help in such cases; a simple straightforward learning scheme can then detect information leak efficiently using only mail pattern analysis. We used our technique on real life mails from financial institutions. By choosing the input variables judiciously, we were able to learn the mail patterns quite well and detected violations efficiently. The preliminary results are encouraging with an accuracy close to 92 %. This technique is now being implemented in a real life commercial tool.

40|$|My main {{research}} interests span computer security, networking and systems problems. My approach {{to these problems}} utilizes techniques from machine learning, data mining and algorithm design. I am also interested in planning under uncertainty and mechanism design. My current research focuses on network security. A recurring problem in my research is to automatically distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious or spurious traffic. This problem arises in several guises in network security, e. g., for spam mitigation at the network-level, we need {{to distinguish between the}} connections that <b>originate</b> from legitimate <b>mail</b> servers and spammers; for worm detection, we need to distinguish between packets that contain exploits and those that do not. Many of these problems are, at core, machine learning or data mining problems – we need to either learn a classifier that identifies legitimate traffic patterns, or to find a known traffic pattern of interest efficiently. However, it is often infeasible to directly apply classical techniques from machine learning and data mining to these problems, {{because of the presence of}} intelligent adversaries and the scale of traffic on the Internet. My research tackles these network security problems by drawing on ideas and tools from learning theory, online learning and streaming algorithm design. We need to design practical algorithms that (1) have guarantees on their long-term performance and resiliency to attackers, and (2) take advantage of problemspecifi...|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Hermán J. Cestero MD, {{from the}} Philatelic Society of Puerto Rico put the {{historic}} event in perspective by explaining {{the practice of}} commemorative stamps. “This is the second US Postal cancellation stamp for Bonzzo {{and the first time}} that a Bonzzo postage stamp has been officially made part of the US Postal Service.” He said that the use of the stamp began as a practical form of showing from where the <b>mail</b> <b>originated,</b> later they were used to commemorate important historical events, in benefit to specific causes and made to cover transportation and handling costs. He later continued to explain -in a separate interview- that the Bonzzo Postage Stamp can be used to send a letter and that it wasn’t purely decorative but real postage, with which you can send mail from everywhere in the US and its territories." [...] The main event got on its way with the general manager of the US Postal Service’s Caribbean district Steven Hernández officially announced the approval of the new Bonzzo stamp. The 45 cent postage seal will perpetuate Rivas’ character in Bonzzo in the chronicles of American history. Interestingly, the founder and other members of Puerto Rico’s own “El Gran Combo” where there in support of their fellow artist on the eve of yet another grand tour they are to take across the world, doing shows in central and South America, Europe and then on to Asia and Japan. El Gran Combo is commemorating its 50th anniversary this year. Even the Maestro, Rafael Ithier himself was there -director and founder El Gran Combo, as well as singer Jerry Rivas, pianist Willie Sotelo and Luis Alfredo [...] "Tati" [...] Maldonado, trumped player for the legendary “salsa” group. Also renowned singer Tony Rivas, Jerry’s brother and both cousins to John, took part in the proceedings.|$|R
