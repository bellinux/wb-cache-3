5|$|A third-person shooter {{video game}} {{of the same name}} was {{released}} on the same week of the release of the film. Christian Bale declined to lend his voice, so Gideon Emery voiced the character of John Connor. The game, however, features the voices of Common and Moon Bloodgood as Barnes and Blair Williams, respectively. Despite not appearing in the film, Rose McGowan voiced the character of Angie Salter, an ex-high school teacher. The game is set in 2016, after the events of Terminator 3: Rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machines</b> and before the events of Terminator Salvation. Another video game also titled Terminator Salvation was released in 2010 in the arcades. It's a light gun shooter developed by Play Mechanix and published by Raw Thrills.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. also {{increased}} the installation {{and use of}} full-body scanners in many of its major airports {{as a result of}} the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors. Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The inclusion of non-Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized.|$|E
5|$|The concept art {{as well as}} the game's codename, Horizon, were leaked in September 2014. Horizon Zero Dawn {{was officially}} {{announced}} during Sony Interactive Entertainment's E3 2015 press conference. The game was featured as the cover story in the September 2015 issue of Edge and the October 2016 issue of Game Informer. At E3 2016, Sony had a life-sized cosplay version of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> greet the trade show attendees. Originally set to be released in 2016, the game was later delayed to February 2017 so as to give additional time for the development team to polish the game. It was released to manufacturing in late January 2017. The game launched to North American markets on 28 February 2017, in Europe on 1 March and Asia on 2 March for the PlayStation 4. Horizon Zero Dawn is forward compatible with the PS4 Pro, allowing it to run up to 4K resolution. In April 2017, a 47-minute documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn was released by Dutch public television. By March 2017, a story expansion had already been set in motion. New Game Plus, an Ultra Hard difficulty mode, additional trophies and aesthetic features were introduced with a patch released in July 2017. The expansion, The Frozen Wilds, launched on 7 November 2017. Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition, which contains the base game, The Frozen Wilds, and all additional downloadable content, releases on 5 December 2017.|$|E

All but two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used in GCHQ until the 1960s.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a conventional machining system by means of mathematical modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> process. <b>The</b> paper considers <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> process as a dynamic interaction between the cutting tool and workpiece {{in space and time}} that additionally involves <b>the</b> dynamic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> tool mechanical subsystem, the cutting motions. An ideal machining system provides an accurately controlled tool path. However, machining experience has shown that <b>the</b> geometric qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> part are not only defined by <b>the</b> uniformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> too path, but are also influenced by <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> tool and cutting process and by the external and internal disturbances. Developed herein, is a systematic approach tying together the four main factors associated with the dynamic processes that play an important role during <b>machining</b> and influence <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> workpiece. These factors are (a) the kinematic/dynamic disturbances within the cutting/feed motion subsystem, (b) <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> tool mechanical subsystem, (c) the tool-workpiece interaction as a dynamic process, and (d) <b>the</b> forming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece surface as a dynamic surface as a dynamic process.
