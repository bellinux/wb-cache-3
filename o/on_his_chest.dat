5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing his hand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, {{the pace of the}} pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters {{a little boy with}} a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing his hand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, {{the pace of the}} pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
5|$|Salander, who {{is under}} state legal {{guardianship}} due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing {{she has a}} hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a taser, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> {{kept him from}} seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying {{that he did not want}} to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{lined up}} in a 4-3-3 {{formation}} while Liverpool, who kicked off the match, {{lined up in}} a 4-4-2. Within nine minutes Liverpool had taken the lead. Defender John Arne Riise ran with the ball from his own half and hit a shot from , which beat Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. Chelsea midfielder Ballack received the first booking of the match in the 7th minute after he kicked Liverpool midfielder Momo Sissoko, and his partner Frank Lampard was given a yellow card eight minutes later for kicking Boudewijn Zenden. Liverpool almost extended their lead in the 22nd minute, when Paulo Ferreira's pass to Cudicini caught him unaware, however the ball went wide of the Chelsea goal and out for a corner. Chelsea made the first substitution of the match in the 26th minute when debutant Salomon Kalou replaced the injured Ballack. Cudicini kept the score at 1–0 in the 42nd minute, when he made saves to deny González and then a subsequent Peter Crouch shot. Chelsea scored two minutes later when Lampard passed the ball cross-field to striker Shevchenko who controlled the ball <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to level the score at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is the {{antagonist}} in Carnivàle; reviewers {{also saw}} {{in him a}} possible alternate protagonist. Brother Justin is introduced as a Methodist minister who resides with his sister Iris {{in the small town}} of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a sanatarium and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and Okies outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the Usher and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the Omega arrives and places her hands <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2013, Hooper scored {{his first}} Premier League goal from the penalty spot against West Ham United at Carrow Road {{to level the}} scores at 1–1. Norwich City won the match 3–1, with Hooper being voted as Man of the Match. Due to this goal, {{he became the first}} player to score in the top 4 {{divisions}} of the English league, the top division of the Scottish League and two cup competitions in each country, as well as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Hooper scored his second Premier League goal and fourth goal in all competitions in just his seventh start for Norwich City, on 30 November 2013 against Crystal Palace, which Norwich City won 1–0 for a vital 3 points. On 7 December, Hooper scored his fifth Norwich City goal and third Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, a first time angled shot across goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into the corner after a through ball from Leroy Fer, the match ended in a 0–2 Norwich City victory. On 15 December, Hooper scored in consecutive Premier League matches, the one-time Scunthorpe United frontman took one touch <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> after a Johan Elmander lay off, before hitting a superb volley 30 yards out over Michel Vorm and into the roof of the net, levelling the score at 1–1. Hooper would score again on the Boxing Day fixture against Fulham as his shot deflected off of Aaron Hughes and past goalkeeper David Stockdale, thus making Hooper the first ever Norwich City player to score in four successive Premier League matches at Carrow Road.|$|E
