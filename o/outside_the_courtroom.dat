5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> but the motion was denied. Fearing {{for the safety of}} Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} trial was under way, events <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{influenced}} public perception of communism: the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon, and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of {{up to five years}} in federal prison, further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng quietly {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into rumors that had been circulating about Little having inappropriate contact with juvenile defendants <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> A subsequent inquiry by the state's Commission on Judicial Conduct found that Little had non-criminal, but inappropriate, encounters with boys who appeared in his court and admonished him for it, however, {{the report of the}} inquiry was sealed.|$|E

25|$|A barrister, {{who can be}} {{considered}} as a jurist, is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> while the trial continues inside.|$|E
25|$|The jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder after a two-hour deliberation, and she was sentenced {{to a maximum of}} life {{imprisonment}} with no eligibility for parole until March 2025. Fans <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> cheered the verdict. Many were seen expressing their delight at the outcome to Saldívar's parents and some wore T-shirts degrading to their daughter. There were more than two hundred accredited media representatives at the courthouse. The trial generated interest in Spain, Europe, South America, Australia and Japan. Tinker announced an appeal but it was denied by Westergren both in 1998 and 1999. Valdez published a book about the trial entitled: Justice for Selena: The State vs. Yolanda Saldívar in 2004. As of December 2014, Saldívar was representing herself in an attempt to be released from prison, claiming that some witnesses were not called during the trial, and that evidence went missing following the trial.|$|E
500|$|During the trial, the {{defendants}} were escorted to a [...] "holding pen" [...] <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi. While in the holding pen, {{they listened to}} the proceedings over loudspeakers. Both defendants were repeatedly cited for contempt of court and eventually barred from the courtroom, where the trial continued in their absence. A contemporary New York Times editorial criticized Williams for failing to maintain courtroom [...] "decorum," [...] comparing her actions to William Kunstler's recent contempt conviction for his actions during the [...] "Chicago Seven" [...] trial.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} courthouse, {{a simple}} two-story building, {{was built in}} 1865 by William R. Craig and F. W. Wood, costing $22,500 at the time. This was a vast improvement upon its predecessors, consisting of small offices in local stores and a cabin at one point. The first addition was completed in 1882. This added a large wing to the square building where the courts and department offices are today. In 1936, an identical wing was added with similar purposes. A mural <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> shows <b>the</b> history of Nebraska City and of the courthouse.|$|R

500|$|During the trial, Scrushy defended himself {{both inside}} and <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Scrushy was interviewed by Mike Wallace for a 60 Minutes segment called [...] "Cooking The Books", began hosting a Christian {{television}} show with his wife called Viewpoint, backed a citywide 40-day prayer movement referred to as [...] "City, thou art loosed", and joined the predominantly African American Guiding Light Church. These actions were seen {{as an attempt to}} sway potential jurors, since 70 percent of Birmingham's population and 11 of the 18 jurors were African American. Following more than a month of deliberations, Scrushy was acquitted of all charges on June 28, 2005.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the trial}} begins, the {{skeleton}} is seen <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Everyone rushes {{to it to}} see a foreboding message that [...] "The End" [...] will come at sundown. Sundown approaches and the citizens gather around the skeleton, but nothing occurs. As Lisa starts to reprimand them, the skeleton silences her and is hoisted over {{to the entrance of}} the new Heavenly Hills Mall. Lisa realizes the whole saga was a publicity stunt for the mall and criticizes management. The bargain-loving public goes shopping and Dr. Gould confesses that he actually never tested Lisa's sample. Marge says that while it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.|$|E
500|$|The {{child sexual}} abuse {{allegations}} of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later. Sneddon was the lead investigator again, {{as well as the}} trial prosecutor. The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts. The two investigations being controlled by Sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music". He then preceded to call Jackson [...] "Wacko Jacko" [...] and shouting [...] "we got him, we finally got him" [...] to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence. [...] "D.S." [...] was sung <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> by a group of Jackson's fans every day the trial took place.|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 September 2013, {{the four}} adult {{defendants}} {{were found guilty}} of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence. All four men faced the death penalty, and demonstrators outside the courthouse called for the hanging of the defendants. The victim's father also called for the defendants to be hanged, stating, [...] "We will get complete closure only if all the accused are wiped off {{from the face of}} the earth." [...] Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict. The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging. Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has [...] "shocked the collective conscience of India" [...] and that [...] "courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes." [...] The victim's family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, [...] "We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved. I thank the people of my country and the media." [...] After the verdict was delivered, the people waiting <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> applauded.|$|E

2500|$|On September 3, 1958, King {{accompanied}} {{her husband and}} Ralph Abernathy to a courtroom.

King rushed to see her husband, and stayed with him for the remainder of his time in the hospital recovering. On February 3, 1959, King, her husband and Lawrence Reddick started a five-week tour of India. The three were invited to hundreds of engagements. During their trip, Coretta used her singing ability to enthuse crowds during their month-long stay. The two returned to the United States on March 10, 1959.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trial of}} Leo Frank begins, {{presided over by}} Judge Roan. A hysterical crowd gathers <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> as Tom Watson spews invective ("Hammer of Justice") and Hugh Dorsey begins {{the case for the}} {{prosecution}} ("Twenty Miles from Marietta"). The prosecution produces a series of witnesses, most of whom give trumped evidence which was clearly fed to them by Dorsey. Frankie Epps testifies, falsely, that Mary mentioned that Frank [...] "looks at her funny" [...] when they last spoke, a sentiment echoed verbatim by three of Mary’s teenage co-workers, Iola, Essie, and Monteen ("The Factory Girls"). In a fantasy sequence, Frank becomes the lecherous seducer of their testimony ("Come Up to My Office"). Testimony is heard from Mary's mother ("My Child Will Forgive Me") and Minnie McKnight before the prosecution's star witness, Jim Conley, takes the stand, claiming that he witnessed the murder and helped Frank cover up the crime ("That's What He Said").|$|E
2500|$|Liddle's Immigration Is A Time Bomb was {{broadcast}} by Channel 4 in 2005. The complaints that followed it included {{that he should}} not have allowed British National Party leader Nick Griffin to speak unchallenged.

Liddle subsequently argued, after Griffin was acquitted in February 2006 of two charges of inciting racial hatred, that the charges were [...] "too ephemeral, too dependent upon the mindset and political disposition of the juror, and upon what is happening <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> on <b>the</b> streets." ...|$|R

Although nominally the Ceaușescus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> improvised <b>courtroom,</b> being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles.|$|R
5000|$|Newspaper {{accounts}} of the time had intimated Edmund's guilt, even before his trial. During {{the final day of}} his trial, a large crowd had gathered in <b>the</b> street <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> court, <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> being packed with spectators. As his acquittal by jury was read was announced to the crowd waiting in the street, the mood was one of anger and disappointment. It has been suggested that Edmund had escaped justice because of his social class, and family connections. His father had previously worked for The Times as a tradesman printer. It is doubtful that Ebenezer Pook would have had any influence on the processes of the law, and considering that his son, and his wider family were harassed by the print media, both during and after the trial, Ebenezer Pook appears to have had little influence over the newspapers.|$|R
