40|$|This paper {{examines}} the order flow diversion hypothesis using cross-listed Singapore Exchange (SGX) futures contracts to test if {{the existence of}} an <b>off-shore</b> <b>market</b> causes the order migration of futures volume from the domestic to foreign markets. Using structural equation systems estimation based on daily turnover, we observe that a 10 % increase in the turnover of the SGX traded Nikkei 225 leads to an increase of 6. 6 % for the Nikkei 225 traded on the OSE. Further examination of the cross-listed Nifty and the MSCI-Taiwan Index futures provide similar evidence of a positive and significant relationship. We also observe that off-shore index futures have a positive and significant impact on domestic component stocks' turnover. Evidence in this study supports the rejection of the order-flow hypothesis, and suggests that a mutually beneficial relationship exists between cross-border exchanges. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Alaska's {{reindeer}} (Rangifer tarandus) {{industry has}} been faced with the competitive need to increase productivity but cautioned to avoid range degradation {{as a result of}} high stocking rates. Consumer demand for lean, healthy, high quality meat has increased throughout the world and has surpassed production. For herders to tap these new domestic and <b>off-shore</b> <b>markets,</b> there will be the need for higher herd numbers and animal productivity, consistent slaughter protocol, and a focused marketing plan. In this paper, we illustrate how record-keeping can benefit reindeer herders in husbandry and management decisions that are necessary to increase animal productivity and, eventually, product quality and profits. These biological parameters were tested in a Lotus ® spreadsheet model designed to predict herd growth and economics. Records of three reinde-er herds on the Seward Peninsula have shown that calf production for adults has ranged from 35 to 98 %. Sensitivity analysis predicted that in some herds, the model was sensitive to small changes in calf survival which could result in insufficient recruitment to maintain long-term harvest. Productivity may be ultimately related to management decisions that cull animals before productivity begins to decline. ...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand export meat {{industry}} has been through {{a considerable number of}} changes in the 1980 s. The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced <b>off-shore</b> <b>marketing</b> operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef and sheepmeat enterprises. Then the principal factors influencing domestic processing margins for these products are empirically examined. Alternative model specifications and alternative estimation techniques are compared and contrasted. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of the historical patterns of assistance and structural change, and in terms of current rationalisation pressures on the meat processing sector.

40|$|Access to <b>off-shore</b> <b>markets,</b> technology, {{and ideas}} are {{important}} to greater productivity and higher living standards in New Zealand. Global connectedness requires deep and rich links with other countries. However, as a small country, we only {{have the resources to}} focus on a handful of countries. Are there a key set of countries with which New Zealand should be seeking to form deeper bilateral economic relationships? This paper reviews the benefits from deeper external bilateral economic engagements using the insights from the new literature on economic growth, which place great importance on trade; international integration, human capital, and local and cross-border knowledge spillovers from research and development (R&D) and foreign direct investment (FDI). This paper will then use insights from the new literature on economic growth to develop criteria for selecting countries as partners for deeper bilateral economic linkages across six global connectedness dimensions: FDI, R&D links, trade in goods, inbound tourism, education exports, and people linkages. To account for the growing role of a number of economies in global trade, the partner selection criteria will identify two groupings of target countries. The first grouping is focus countries: those countries that are of immediate interest for deeper bilateral linkages. The second country grouping is horizon countries: countries that are likely to grow in their importance to New Zealand over the next 10 to 20 years. The key message of this paper is a greater bilateral economic focus by New Zealand on the major economies along the Asia-Pacific Rim (and the UK). When external initiatives come before decision-makers, they should be seen through a lens that places greater confidence in proposals for deeper relationships with the Asia-Pacific Rim countries (or the UK), and greater scrutiny of proposals that emphasise other regions and countries. economic growth; trade; economic integration; migration; technology diffusion; New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|The paper reviews {{a number}} of issues related to the use of {{currencies}} in international trade, more than one decade after the introduction of the euro and shortly after steps taken by the Chinese authorities to liberalize the use of the RMB in <b>off-shore</b> <b>markets.</b> Trade {{is an important factor in}} establishing a currency as an international currency, notably by fulfilling the transaction/medium of exchange and unit of account motives of currency demand. A well prepared liberalization of currency use for international trade and foreign direct investment transactions can even be helpful in achieving the international investment and reserve currency status. While in the distant past the later was also linked to preponderance of a country in trade markets, it is now linked to the prevalence of the currency in international financial transactions, which supposes that the country in question engages at least partly in some liberalization of capital account transactions. This paper shows theoretical and practical reasons explaining the current dominance of the US dollar and the euro in the invoicing of international trade. There is little doubt, though, that in the medium-to-long term the RMB will become a major currency of settlement in international trade. This is not only the current direction of government policy but also that of markets, as evidenced by the rapid expansion of off-shore trade payments in that currency. In the meantime, though, the US dollar and the euro are enjoying a near-duopoly as settlement and invoicing currencies in international trade. The stability of this duopoly is enhanced by {{a number of}} factors recently highlighted by economic analysis: coalescing, thick externalities and scarcity of international currencies are useful to explain that, until such time that RMB payments match at least the share of China in global trade, the US dollar and of the euro will remain the main currencies in the invoicing and payment of international trade. Section 1 looks at the factors that determine the use of currencies in the invoicing and settlement of international trade. Section 2 looks at the actual reality of currency use for international trade flows, and short-term prospects for the development of a possible alternative to the use of the US dollar and the euro (in particular in Asia), the RMB...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} capital controls in insulating economies from currency crises and capital flow contractions, focusing in particular on how these relationships may have changed over time in response to global financial changes {{and the development of}} domestic and <b>off-shore</b> financial <b>markets.</b> We predict the likelihood of currency crises and capital account contractions using standard macroeconomic variables and a probit equation estimation methodology with random effects. We employ a comprehensive panel data set comprised of 69 emerging market and developing economies over 1975 – 2004. Both standard and duration-adjusted measures of capital control intensity (allowing controls to “depreciate ” over time) suggest that capital controls have not effectively insulated economies from currency crises at any time during our sample period. Countries with less restrictive capital controls and more liberalized regimes appear to be less prone to currency crises and this characteristic has become more pronounced in recent years (1995 - 2004). We find only weak evidence that capital controls have helped to prevent capital account contractions but this effect appears to have strengthened in recent years, i. e. controls appear to facilitate a smoother flow of international capital movements but do not prevent large financial disruptions. In all cases, maintaining real GDP growth and preventing real overvaluation of the currency are critical factors preventing currency crises and capital flow contractions. The presence of capital controls greatly increases the sensitivity of currency crises to changes in real GDP growth and real exchange rate overvaluation. This is not the case for capital flow contractions...|$|R

40|$|One {{in every}} ten Sri Lankan lives abroad. Modern ICT and {{transportation}} facilities have increased labour mobility {{and the creation}} of transnational communities. Diaspora members could be resourceful in two ways to their home country, through discussions and transactions. Discussions include email, instant messaging, websites, forums and social media through which Diaspora maintains close relationships with those living in their home country and others living abroad. Transactions include remittances, investments and commitments in terms of time and knowledge. The key feature of Diaspora is their retained affinity to their home country and high motivation to contribute to its development. This research study is focused on Diaspora contribution to the Sri Lankan IT industry. Leaving aside the diverse composition of the Diaspora, it's influence on events in the country and the many ways they contribute to the economy, the author delves into the background of 23 individuals who went overseas for higher studies and returned back to initiate businesses, often as 'first movers' in the field. An industry that started off with a few multinational companies providing IT infrastructure and services two decades back, saw the emergence of local firms around the 90 s entering the application products, software services, <b>off-shore</b> development <b>markets</b> and later the IT BPO market. Behind these developments are Diaspora members who have done pioneering work, giving their knowledge and expertise and often acting as the catalysts in the industry. They use their global networks to launch new businesses for foreign markets and to find the finances to support new ventures. In an era of globalization where skilled migration is inevitable this study looks into ways the country can benefit from its Diaspora. What attracts the Diaspora back home - especially the student population studying overseas? What can the government and the various supportive institutions do to encourage IT entrepreneurship?

40|$|The {{globalisation}} hypothesis {{has altered}} {{many of the}} common-sense ‘truths’ around which the social world is organised. * In particular, globalisation is thought to restrict {{the parameters of the}} politically and economically possible. Indeed, the notion of constrained choice is so pronounced that we are increasingly confronted with the image of globalisation’s ‘logic of no alternative’; an image which is predicated on the assumption of perfect capital mobility. Capital is considered to be sufficiently rational to take advantage of enhanced exit options from the national economy in circumstances in which its interests are served by moving <b>off-shore.</b> Moreover, global <b>markets</b> are also assumed to have exploited contemporary technological developments {{to such an extent that}} they now clear instantaneously; consequently, allowing capital to further its interests wherever in the world new profit opportunities arise. Thus, we are presented with the fundamental ‘reality’ of globalisation as currently narrated throughout much of the west: unless the market can be allowed to restore a competitive global equilibrium, capital will exit high-wage, high-cost western economies and re-locate in lower-wage, lower-cost, newly industrialising economies. Under the auspices of ever more hostile wage competition from the newly industrialising economies, globalisation is commonly presumed to act as a trigger for an ‘inevitable’ job displacement effect as capital deserts the advanced industrialised economies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Since the 1990 's {{the fashion}} {{industry}} has reflected the issues generally arising in the manufacturing sector, namely rapid and deep structural changes, {{the development of new}} supply chain relationships, ICT impacts and increasing globalisation with the attendant issues of ethical sourcing, <b>off-shoring,</b> new emerging <b>markets</b> and recessionary ripples. This paper focuses on one particular aspect of {{the fashion industry}}, namely the apparel sector and in particular 'fast fashion' to explore the issues arising for the SMEs in the supply chain. Approach: The research adopts a qualitative methodology and is longitudinal in nature, spanning 5 years from August 2006. The first stage of the research is reported here, where a series of focussed interview scenarios were conducted over an eighteenth month period. The sample of 12 SMEs was a convenience one, drawn from the 30 participants who took part in a business to business event in Leicester, a geographical location which acts as a microcosm of the apparel industry. Interviews were used to elicit narrative data about was what was actually happening in these apparel supply chains. Findings: The apparel supply chain has changed significantly due to recessionary ripples and structural changes. The SMEs have had more success in managing the upstream rather than the downstream relationships and relationships between buyer and suppliers continue to be fractious. Innovation has occurred but is hampered by the relationships that persist. Culture {{has proved to be a}} key dimension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} U. S. multinational firms’ offshoring activity {{and the structure of}} U. S trade preferences. We combine firm level panel data on U. S. foreign affiliate activity from the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) with detailed measures of U. S. trade preferences from the U. S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to create a three-way panel that spans 80 industries, 184 countries, and ten years (1997 - 2006). Consistent with existing theory, we find that <b>off-shoring</b> and preferential <b>market</b> access are positively and consistently correlated, both in the pooled sample and within countries, industries, and years. Using instrumental variables to address the endogeneity of export-oriented foreign investment, we find that a 10 % increase in U. S. foreign affiliate exports to the U. S. from a particular industry and country is associated with a 4 percentage point increase in the rate of preferen-tial duty-free access. Restricting attention to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) among potentially eligible developing countries, we find that the influence of multinational affiliate sales on preferential market access more than triples relative to the baseline, full sample results. Date: July 17, 2014. The statistical analysis of firm-level data on U. S. multinational companies was conducted at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U. S.
