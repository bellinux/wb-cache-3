About 80% of the population of Os lived in urban settlements. About 1.9% of the population were registered as unemployed; the county and national average is 2.6%. 26% of the workforce were employed in public administration. 2% were employed in the primary sector of economic activity, 28.2 in the secondary sector, and 69.3% in the tertiary sector. In the period from 29 October to 4 November 2001, 45.7% of the workforce of Os commuted out of the municipality, mainly to Bergen. In the same period, Os received a daily average of 753 commuters from other municipalities, 15.8% of those employed in Os. In 2006, Os had a daily <b>out-commuting</b> of 3,001 people.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Office of Management and Budget {{defines a}} set of core based {{statistical}} areas (CBSAs) throughout the country. CBSAs are delineated {{on the basis of}} a central urban area or urban clusterin other words: a contiguous area of relatively high population density. CBSAs are composed of counties and county equivalents. The counties containing the core urban area are known as the central counties of the CBSA. Additional surrounding counties, known as outlying counties, can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if the employment interchange measure (total of in- and <b>out-commuting)</b> is 25% or more, although these numbers are estimates and exceptions are made. Some areas within these outlying counties may be rural in nature. As well as MSAs, CBSAs are subdivided into micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs) based on the population of the core urban area. Under certain conditions, one or more CBSAs may be grouped together to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA). Previous terms that are no longer used include standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) and primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA). In New England, towns have precedence over counties, so statistically similar areas are defined in terms of town-based units known as New England city and town areas (NECTAs).|$|E
40|$|Commuting {{ties between}} rural places of {{residence}} and urban places of employment {{are among the}} most visible forms of rural-urban integration. For some rural areas, access to urban employment is a key source of population retention and growth. However, this access varies considerably across rural areas, with distance representing a primary deterrent. In addition to distance, the size of the urban community will also influence rural-to-urban commuting opportunities. In this paper, using Canadian data, we empirically estimated the influence of local rural population and job growth on rural <b>out-commuting</b> within the urban hierarchy. We find consistent support for the deconcentration hypothesis where population moves to rural areas for lifestyle and quality of life reasons, while retaining urban employment. Further, we find some evidence that in addition to distance from the nearest urban center being a deterrent, increased remoteness {{from the top of the}} urban hierarchy exerts a "positive" influence on <b>out-commuting.</b> Recognition of these types of rural-urban linkages through commuting is essential in designing Canadian rural policy and targeted programs that may effectively support local rural populations. In particular, they point to the need to have reasonable transportation infrastructure for urban accessibility, which should be complemented by other "built" infrastructure to improve the livability of rural communities.

Whilst the centre {{and south of}} the Manchester conurbation have benefited from notable economic growth, this has not been so in the north due to its continued reliance on a depleting manufacturing base. Bury in particular has become suburbanised with few significant private sector employers, and with low income domestic employment contrasting with relatively high income, <b>out-commuting,</b> city-centre based jobs. The town has a good transport infrastructure, but low inward investment except for housing. Bury's main assets are high achievement levels in its schools and colleges, the famous Bury Market, which attracts 12 million visitors per year, and a pleasant environment. The Times described it as 'a friendly town, with plenty of character, and very convenient for Manchester'. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{two forms}} of local {{regression}} are employed {{in the analysis of}} relations between <b>out-commuting</b> distance and other socioeconomic variables in Northern Ireland. The two regression approaches used are moving window regression (MWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). For the first approach different window sizes are applied and changes in results assessed. For the second approach, a Gaussian kernel is used and its bandwidth varied. Seven independent variables are utilised, although a single variable (deprivation) provides the main analytical focus. Differences in results obtained with use of the two approaches are discussed. The relationship between window size or bandwidth size and observed spatial patterning is discussed and elucidated. The results support previous work that indicated severe limitations in using global regressions to examine relationships between socioeconomic variables. Also, the utility of comparing results obtained from MWR and GWR is assessed and the benefits of both approaches are outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|As substate {{policy makers}} design {{economic}} development strategies {{and respond to}} struc-tural changes in their economic base, {{it is important to}} understand effects on the local sales tax. Local sales taxes are modeled here as arising from three sources: resident de-mand, taxable business-to-business transactions, and visitor/commuter spending. Care-ful attention is paid to how sales tax payments are actually made and distributed to local governments. The results indicate clearly positive effects from tourism and in-commuting, whereas <b>out-commuting</b> yields a revenue drain. Construction provides a sig-nificant boost to local sales tax revenue, but the effects of manufacturing and services are surprising. Manufacturers, through a combination of exempt inputs and exported final products, provide no clear sales tax impact. The service sector, however, produces nota-ble revenue gains. The findings provide general guidance on the way in which shifts in economic structure can influence local sales tax revenue and call into question revenue effects from traditional smokestack-chasing economic development policies of local governments...|$|E
40|$|Labor market areas (LMAs) {{have long}} been a staple of {{regional}} and urban analysis. As commuting patterns have expanded over time, these areas have become larger and more complex, and the dichotomous designation of a county either belonging to an LMA or not {{may no longer be}} adequate. We apply recent advances in network science to conduct a more refined analysis of U. S. commuting patterns, and examine their effects on local economic growth. Results show that network degree and entropy measures explain variations in county per capita income growth patterns. Higher in- and <b>out-commuting</b> entropies are associated with lower per capita income growth, but their interaction enhances economic growth in places simultaneously open to both in- and out-commuters. Using these results, common ground may be found for creating new forms of regional governance that better reflect local realities of cross-county border flows of workers and economic activity.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJeffrey M. PetersonState {{and local}} {{economic}} development policies are often created {{with the goal}} of stimulating local economic activity through employment growth. The success of these policies is commonly measured by the number of jobs they create. Because labor markets are not bound by county lines, commuting and migration are important factors to consider when measuring employment growth in a region. This study used county-level data from the 2000 Census to predict labor force participation, unemployment, in-commuting, and <b>out-commuting.</b> The model was estimated using Ordinary Least Squares regression and was simulated to predict changes in labor force, unemployment and commuting {{as a result of a}} change in employment for all 105 Kansas counties. An increase in employment was found to increase the labor force participation, in-commuting, and unemployment, while decreasing the number of out-commuters. The increase in in-commuting causes many of the economic benefits expected to accrue to the county where the job growth occurred to be essentially exported to the county where the in-commuters live. Failure to account for the proportion of new jobs filled by in-commuters would lead to significant over estimations of local impacts of employment growth. These results suggest that regional coordination of economic development policies, through the use of tools such as tax-base sharing, would provide substantial gains to otherwise competing local governments...|$|E
40|$|All {{transportation}} systems {{have the ability}} to transform human settlement patterns, which can affect a range of social, economic and environmental issues. Considering investments in rail infrastructure have increased in recent decades (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2007; Israel 2 ̆ 6 Cohen-Blankshtain, 2010), it is important for planners and researchers to understand how these rail systems influence land use, metropolitan development patterns, and population migration. The following paragraphs summarize the studies and their findings. The Effects of Commuter Rail Establishment on the Relationships between the Built Environment, Travel Behavior, and Residential Self- Selection (RSS) : To help regional and transportation planners better understand the role that commuter rail plays in directing intra-regional development, this chapter provides a longitudinal investigation of the influence of commuter rail on surrounding neighborhoods’ RSS, travel behavior and the built environment. We first analyze the role of commuter rail establishment in influencing change in neighborhood-level demographics, housing and economics (signs of RSS), and travel behavior. Second, we compare surveyed commuter rail riders to residents of the commuter rail stations’ host and neighboring areas. The results indicate that the development of commuter rail does not alter the host tracts in any of the characteristics observed, but rather suppresses population growth in neighboring tracts. Paired with direct evidence from a commuter rail user survey, we conclude that the use of commuter rail is more likely influenced by the built environment than by RSS. The Effects of Commuter Rail Establishment on Population Deconcentration: Research to date has not established the efficacy of commuter rail systems in attracting migrants most likely to use such an amenity. Through the application of a modified population deconcentration model, this chapter finds that the provision of a commuter rail station significantly increases neighborhood-level <b>out-commuting</b> and gross migration, which signals success in attracting migrants requiring commuting infrastructure. These findings also signal that commuter rail encourages regional population deconcentration, but the evidence is insufficient to form a conclusion and the evidence from Chapters 2 and 4 signal otherwise. Developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) For Estimation of Land Use Changes around Commuter Rail Stations over Time: This chapter improves the understanding of commuter rails’ effect on future land use changes through spatial interaction modeling. In particular, we develop an innovative agent-based model (ABM) that allows us to estimate and visualize the probability of land use changes per parcel based on proximity to commuter rail stations, freeway exits, and the region’s central business district. Briefly, this chapter concludes that the development of a commuter rail station is statistically significantly associated with decreases in single-family residential land use near the station, which is met by increases in multifamily and mixed-use development. The spatial effects of stations on individual land uses vary by land use type, and no generalizable area of influence could be established. This report points to potential future research, as well as implications for planning practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, to {{identify}} spatial and temporal disparities in economic growth and human capital in the Australian context; and second, to discuss the relative contribution of two theoretical approaches to address these regional disparities in relation to the university as a vehicle for community engaged knowledge creation and distribution. The two approaches are Sen’s capability approach, and ‘enterprising human capital’ and ‘sp-ethics’ originated by the author and others in earlier work. The questions reviewed in this context have implications for local strategies for economic sustainability based on endogenous knowledge accessibility and social inclusiveness, the underemployment and flight of human capital from many nonmetropolitan regions, and the community engaging role universities play in these regional human capital questions. The questions are addressed from three perspectives: the normative individual seeking to enhance their human capital or realise their capability; the region as a creative and innovative milieu or place for connectivity; and the learning institution (the university in particular) and its role for these individuals and spatial societies. It is argued that these actors and agencies need to be strategically connected, or engaged, with a focus that goes beyond a concern only for production and commodities and moves towards capability-building initiatives and matters of social inclusion. The latter takes into account individual cognition and the influence of attachment to place as an exogenous environmental determinant. Design / Methodology / Approach: The research uses econometric analysis to identify the extent of spatial disparity in economic growth and to identify its significant drivers across 94 regions in the Australian context over an 18 year period. The disparity is manifest in such labour market/ demographic characteristics as an ageing population, skills ‘brain drain’, ‘just-in-time’ vocational training, rural-urban population drift, daily <b>out-commuting,</b> and ‘lifestyle’ underemployment which are now familiar labour market characteristics that affect many regions outside the major metropolitan conurbations. The paper examines two approaches as mechanisms for addressing the spatial disparity, viz: Sen’s capability approach, and ‘enterprising human capital’ and ‘sp-ethics’ both originated by the author and others. A regional example from Sweden is presented which demonstrates the role of the university in building human capability within an innovation system in a region undergoing revitalisation. The paper concludes both approaches have their role and both need to be enhanced through either having stronger connection to the regional milieu and attachment to place in the case of the capability approach and to detailed aspects of cognition in the case of the ‘enterprising human capital’ approach. Originality / Value: The research offers two original elements. First, it undertakes a substantial spatial and temporal analysis of spatial growth and its drivers and consequently identifies stocks and flows of human capital as the most significant determinant causing entrenched and increasing regional growth disparity. Second, it suggests the regional milieu and attachment to place are exogenous influencers of human capability and are a means of addressing spatial disparity. The research provides evidence for government education and spatial policy and for regional and business practice concerned with building individual capability and regional outcomes. The approach identifies a new avenue of application in the use of the capability approach and offers a new avenue for theoretical, policy and practical work in relation to regional development. Practical Implications: For the individual it suggests the possibility of enhanced capability through investment in learning during ‘critical life stages’ and through engagement in the regional community as ‘critical and sensitive places’ of significance. The paper suggests a new approach to policy and practice at an institutional and local community level in addressing growth in non-metropolitan regions. The regional milieu and attachment to place are offered as a supportive atmosphere for collaboration and dialogue where knowledge spillovers and transmission effects are nurtured and promoted and can therefore generate community outcomes beyond individual achievement. For the university it offers a practical approach to its ‘third mission’. Universities play an important regional role because of their focus on human capital and the creation and dissemination of knowledge, their spatial distribution, and their relative institutional freedom of thought and expression. It is argued that universities, with others, have a common good responsibility to ‘reach out to’ and ‘pull through’ the human capital pyramid people with capability who are on the margins of the community and to enhance social inclusion as well as economic sustainability...|$|E
