40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Clinical care often {{requires}} referrals, but many referrals never result in completed evaluations. We determined {{the extent to}} which referral-based consultations were completed in a US medical institution. Factors associated with completion were identified. METHOD: In a cross-sectional analysis, we analysed billing records and electronic and paper-based medical records for patients aged 65 years or older receiving health care between July 2000 and June 2002 in an integrated, urban, tax-supported medical institution on an academic campus. All referrals in ambulatory care, scheduling of consultation within 180 days, and completion were assessed. We conducted a multivariate survival analysis to identify factors associated with completion. RESULTS: We identified 6785 patients with encounters. Mean age was 72 years, and, of the participants, 66 % were women, 55 % were African-American and 32 % were Medicaid eligible. Of the 81 % with at least one primary-care visit in ambulatory care, 63 % had at least one referral. About 8 % <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> required multiple <b>orders</b> before an appointment was scheduled. Among 7819 orders for specialty consultation in ambulatory care, 71 % led to appointments, and 70 % of appointments were kept (completed = 0. 71 * 0. 70 or 50 %). Scheduling of consultations varied (12 % to 90 %) by specialty. Medicare, singular <b>orders,</b> location <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> and lack <b>of</b> hospitalization were independently significantly associated with scheduling of appointments. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults studied, half <b>of</b> medical specialty <b>referrals</b> were not completed. Multiple process errors, including missing information, misguided referrals and faulty communications, likely contribute to these results. Information systems offer important opportunities to improve the referrals process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Introduction <b>Referral</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the core}} {{competencies}} of general practitioners (GP). In 1992, the European study <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> from Primary to Secondary care indicated a <b>referral</b> rate (RR) <b>of</b> 5, 56 % to Portugal. In 2003, the RR {{related to a}} health centre {{in the north of}} Portugal was 10, 11 % and the higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> was to Otolaryngology, Gynecology and Surgery. Objectives To study the trend <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> to Secondary care, in a Centre of Portugal Health Care Unit, with standardized population indicators, between 2007 and 2010. Material and Methods Observational, retrospective, descriptive study using a statistical program to study the informatics generated data <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> in a health centre with 11 doctors and 5 trainees. Calculation of the RR, (n referral/n total consultations) * 100, and the number <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> by day adjusted to population at the middle of each year (CRA), (n referral* 1000 / population at the middle of the year* 365). We characterized the six specialties with more referrals, for each year. Results In 2007, 2067 referrals were registered (14, 7 % of patients with consultation (PC)); in 2008, 2639 (17 % of PC); in 2009, 3125 (18, 6 % of PC); in 2010, 3100 (18 % of PC). The RR and the CRA were 3, 93 % and 0, 34 ‰ in 2007; 4, 77 % and 0, 42 ‰ in 2008; 5, 51 % and 0, 48 ‰ in 2009; 5, 64 % and 0, 46 ‰ in 2010. In decrescent <b>order</b> <b>of</b> volume, the specialties with most referrals were Orthopedics, Dermatology, Stomatology, Gynecology, Otolaryngology, Surgery and in 2009 Ophthalmology, in detriment to Gynecology. Discussion During the time considered there is growth of RR, to values similar to those of 1992, and of CRA, an indicator of comparability with other contexts. The three specialties with the higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> suggest the need for technical response (orthopedics and stomatology) and clarification / clinical orientation (dermatology). The reduction in referral to Gynecology and the increase to Ophthalmology might reflect technical and scientific options in General Practice performing skills. The volume <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> and its characterization may improve our knowledge in these areas and about the need for continuing professional development...|$|R

A total of 705 new patient referrals to 13 specialties were included in the study. Twelve of the 38 specialists were randomly selected and their 234 new patient referral letters were independently assessed by a general practitioner for the appropriateness <b>of</b> the <b>referral</b> decision. The study revealed errors and omissions in between 5 % and 28 % <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> letters according to the category of information. Thirteen per cent of the new patient referrals were assessed by specialists to be inappropriate and 4 % of patients had been referred to an inappropriate specialty. Significantly more <b>of</b> the <b>referrals</b> to medical specialties were inappropriate (20 %) than to surgical specialties (9 %) (P < 0. 01). There were more than three times the number of errors and omissions in the <b>referral</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> assessed as inappropriate than in the <b>referral</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> assessed as appropriate (P < 0. 01).

RESULTS [...] General practitioners judged that access to specialist care, the individual skill of general practitioners, patient demand, and fear of litigation were major determinants <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> behaviour. Because there was widespread scepticism about the accuracy of the data on which the feedback was based and because there is no clear relation between rates <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> and quality <b>of</b> care, it was extremely difficult to encourage doctors to use the feedback as a basis for auditing their own hospital referrals.

SETTING [...] Practices within Cambridge Health Authority and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Data on practice referral rates from hospital computers, inappropriate referrals as judged by hospital consultants, and inappropriate referrals as judged against referral guidelines which had been developed locally between general practitioners and specialists. Effect <b>of</b> <b>referral</b> guidelines on referral patterns as judged by general practitioners using the guidelines in clinical practice. RESULTS [...] There was 2. 5 -fold variation in referral rates among general practices. According to the specialists, 9. 6 % (95 % confidence interval 6. 4 % to 12. 9 %) <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> by general practitioners and 8. 9 % (2. 6 % to 15. 2 %) <b>of</b> <b>referrals</b> from other specialists were judged possibly or definitely inappropriate.
