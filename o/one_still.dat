5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, <b>one</b> <b>still</b> exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E
