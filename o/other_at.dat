5|$|A feud began between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect after WrestleMania IX as {{a result}} of Michaels attacking Perfect. They faced each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> SummerSlam 1993, and Michaels won by countout after his new bodyguard, Diesel {{attacked}} Perfect. Perfect then feuded with Diesel until leaving the WWF.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each <b>other,</b> <b>at</b> a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each <b>other.</b> <b>At</b> 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō {{and told him that}} no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|E
5|$|At Drury Lane {{later in}} 1800, he starred {{as an officer}} in The Wheel of Fortune by Richard Cumberland, a Jewish pedlar in The Indian, as Clown in Robinson Crusoe, and as the Second Gravedigger in Hamlet, {{alongside}} John Philip Kemble. Grimaldi's wife Maria and his unborn child died during childbirth on 18 October 1800. To cope with his grief, Grimaldi would often perform two shows a night; one at Sadler's Wells and the <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Drury Lane.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) hold each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> gunpoint. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), the person lingering outside his apartment, bursts in and forces Skinner to put his gun down. He also demands that Skinner surrender the digital tape. Skinner insists on keeping the tape, saying it is their only leverage in exposing the conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Crush faced WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels {{several times}} in early 1993 {{but was unable to}} win the title belt. The pair also faced each other in a {{qualifying}} match for the King of the Ring tournament on the May 23 episode of WWF Superstars. The match ended in a double countout, however, and both wrestlers were eliminated from the tournament. It was later announced that they would wrestle each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> King of the Ring 1993, with Michaels's championship on the line.|$|E

5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> either end of a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot {{in order to protect}} himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and '80s (the main era for {{organised}} football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for {{the levels}} of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the '70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.|$|E

Though they did not like each <b>other</b> <b>at</b> first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, he and {{his wife}} Annie became {{partners}} with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two Pacific Bio-diesel plants, one in Salem, Oregon, and the <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Carl's Corner, Texas (the Texas plant was founded by Carl Cornelius, a longtime Nelson friend and the namesake for Carl's Corner). In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel ("Bio-Willie"), a company that is marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops. The fuel is made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in diesel engines.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men.

5|$|Many elite {{research}} {{medical centers}} {{are located in}} Texas. The state has nine medical schools, three dental schools, and two optometry schools.

The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E
