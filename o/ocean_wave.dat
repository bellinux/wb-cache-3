40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>waves</b> can be {{explained}} in terms of many factors, including wave spectrum, which has the characteristics of wave height and periodicity, directional spreading function, which has a directional property, and random phase, which randomly represents a certain property. Under the assumption of a linear system, <b>ocean</b> <b>waves</b> show irregular behaviours, which can be observed in the forms of wave spectrum, directional spreading function, and complex phase calculations using the method of linear superposition. <b>Ocean</b> <b>waves,</b> which include a variety of periodic elements, exhibit direct proportionality between their period and propagation velocity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the phase components of the period and to make exact calculations on the deterministic phase in order to make predictions on <b>ocean</b> <b>waves.</b> However, measurements of actual <b>ocean</b> <b>waves</b> exist only in the form of information on wave elevation, so we faced an inverse problem of having to analyse this information and calculate the deterministic phase. Regularization was used as part of the solution, and various methods were used to obtain stable values...|$|R

25|$|Wavelength can be {{a useful}} concept even if the wave is not {{periodic}} in space. For example, in an <b>ocean</b> <b>wave</b> approaching shore, the incoming wave undulates with a varying local wavelength that depends {{in part on the}} depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height. The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.|$|E

25|$|Shock waves {{can form}} due to steepening of {{ordinary}} waves. The best-known {{example of this}} phenomenon is ocean waves that form breakers on the shore. In shallow water, the speed of surface waves {{is dependent on the}} depth of the water. An incoming <b>ocean</b> <b>wave</b> has a slightly higher wave speed near the crest of each wave than near the troughs between waves, because the wave height is not infinitesimal compared to the depth of the water. The crests overtake the troughs until {{the leading edge of the}} wave forms a vertical face and spills over to form a turbulent shock (a breaker) that dissipates the wave's energy as sound and heat.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of atmospheric particulates that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from <b>ocean</b> <b>wave</b> spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as ice nuclei in colder parts of the atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|The first <b>ocean</b> <b>wave</b> {{models were}} {{developed}} in the 1960s and 1970s. [...] These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions. [...] A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited {{the performance of the}} models. [...] After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions. [...] A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind-driven waves (also known as wind waves) caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones. [...] This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward.|$|E
