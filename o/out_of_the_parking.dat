After the tour, Homer refuses to let the {{extremely}} drunk Barney drive home and forces him to hand over his keys. On their way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot, their car is pulled over by police Chief Wiggum, along with Eddie and Lou. They administer a breathalyser test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, his license is revoked, and he must attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam Hot Line. Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam. Glen Oaks was later revealed to be the home of Berkowitz's sister and was close {{to the site of the}} Donna DiMaise and Joanne LoMino shootings.|$|E

500|$|In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly {{got into}} a fight over the coaches trying to {{restrain}} the players when they were defending themselves. Artest asked Jackson whether he thought the players would get in trouble. Jackson responded, [...] "We'll be lucky if we have a freaking job." [...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't in his right mind, to ask that question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lots.|$|E
500|$|Having {{submitted}} his two weeks' {{notice to}} Dunder Mifflin, Michael (Steve Carell) begins goofing off and drinking around the office, while new company vice president Charles Miner (Idris Elba) plans {{to hire the}} new regional manager from the outside, for [...] "obvious reasons." [...] The employees suggest that Michael start looking for another job. Michael is unworried at first, until he learns how poorly the economy is performing. He first tries Prince Paper, but they had been run out of business by Dunder Mifflin. After finding no available work, Michael decides {{to start his own}} paper company and unsuccessfully tries to convince others around the office to join him. When Charles catches Michael labeling Dunder Mifflin customer lists with his new company's name, he orders security guard Hank (Hugh Dane) to escort Michael from the building. Michael drives <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot, but is later spotted sneaking back into the building.|$|E
500|$|Steve Helling of People {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} Lovato shows her mature {{side in the}} video, saying that [...] "it's hard not to notice that the 16-year-old Camp Rock star is growing up." [...] The video begins in a tour bus with Lovato's band. She is seen sitting next to a window {{in the back of}} the bus, where she precedes to sing the first lines. As the song progresses, she walks out of the bus in the rain, holding an umbrella. She walks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot and into an amusement park, where she stands in front of a carousel in the rain as she continues to sing. After the second chorus, Lovato and her band perform in the rain with the water altering colors in the background. As the last verse approaches, she is back on the tour bus. A single tear rolls down her cheek and the video ends.|$|E

500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one last look at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of May 11, 1982, Bulger was told the {{whereabouts}} of a former associate turned Federal informant, Edward Brian Halloran, known on the streets as [...] "Balloonhead". After arriving at the scene, Weeks staked out Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant, where Halloran and construction worker Michael Donahue were dining together. As Donahue and Halloran drove <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot Weeks signaled Bulger by stating, [...] "The balloon is in the air", over a hand held radio. Bulger drove up with a masked man armed with a silenced Mac 10; Bulger himself carried a [...]30 caliber carbine.
