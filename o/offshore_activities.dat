5|$|Throughout Linfa's {{passage of}} Japan, the storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across a wide}} swath of the country, resulting in extensive and damaging flooding. Damage was primarily concentrated on Kyushu Island. Precipitation peaked at 727mm (28.62in) at a station in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture. However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497mm (19.56in) of rain in 24hours, greater than any other location for that period of time. Despite making landfall on Ehime Prefecture, Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300homes lost power during the storm there. Linfa's worst impacts occurred in Kōchi Prefecture, where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled ¥1.28billion (US$10.7million). Similar effects took place in Tokushima Prefecture, in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima Prefecture reached ¥1.22billion (US$10.3million). Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama Prefecture, resulting in cancellations of <b>offshore</b> <b>activities</b> and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama Prefecture was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to ¥197.45million (US$1.65million). Severe flooding in Mie Prefecture resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497mm (19.57in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65buildings were flooded, and approximately 87ha (215ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations. Power outages were also widespread in Hyōgo Prefecture, including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe; similar impacts occurred in Osaka Prefecture. Rising floodwater in Kanagawa Prefecture engulfed the first floors of several office buildings and residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara.|$|E

While it {{has a long history}} of ferry services to England, the town is by no means a tourist destination. Lonely Planet remarked that [...] "nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday, in fact, as with many industrial ports, most visitors rush through as quickly as possible". Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark's oil and <b>offshore</b> <b>activities,</b> with companies like Maersk, Ramboll, Stimwell Services, ABB, Schlumberger, COWI and Atkins all having offshore-related activities in the town. Halliburton has an office in Esbjerg. The port has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas were first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s. More recently, it has become a centre for shipping offshore wind turbines. In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines, which supply [...] of offshore wind power, components have been shipped to various British wind farms. In order to cope with enormous future increases in Danish offshore wind power, 12 companies, including DONG Energy and Bluewater Energy Services are already planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{studies have been}} searching for evidence on and driving forces for offshoring. Typically, this search has been conducted by analysing gross trade flows related to <b>offshored</b> <b>activities</b> using gravity equations augmented by ad hoc measures of supply-side country differences. This paper suggests that gravity formulations of this sort are potentially mis-specified, due to theoretically unmotivated attempts of allowing for both complete and incomplete specialisation influences on gross trade flows within the same gravity framework. The paper suggests an alternative specification rooted in incomplete specialisation with complete specialisation as a natural limiting case. Re-sults support evidence for <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> across Europe, driven by supply-side country differences compatible with models of incomplete specialisation and trade.

40|$|Offshoring can {{be defined}} as the {{relocation}} of organizational tasks and services to foreign locations. Increasingly, firms experience that unforeseen costs and difficulties of managing offshoring undercut anticipated benefits; that unexpected challenges of offshoring jeopardize and eventually undermine initial objectives. Guided by the research question—what are the organizational consequences of offshoring?—the purpose of this thesis is to investigate why some firms fail when offshoring and other do not. The thesis consists of four research papers using various datasets and methodologies that investigate offshoring in an organizational context. The first paper investigates how the complexity of offshoring leads to ‘hidden costs’ of implementing <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities.</b> The second paper looks at how these hidden reconfiguration costs influence the process performance of the <b>offshored</b> <b>activity</b> and how this relationship is moderated by the modularity of that activity. The third paper investigates the effect of the organizational reconfiguration of offshoring on firms’ strategies. The final paper studies different strategies of adaptation in offshoring. Taken together, this thesis argues that whether firms relocate activities with the purpose of accessing resources or as a response to political pressures, the process of offshoring presents firms with the challenge of coordinating and integrating <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> in a global organization. The complexities and uncertainties of an organization consisting of a number of <b>offshored</b> <b>activities</b> (in contrast to an organization with only co-located activities) require firms to invest additional resources in coordination mechanisms so that an efficient reintegration can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} production offshoring – {{the relocation}} of production activities to locations abroad – of European firms. The analysis employs data from the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS). <b>Offshoring</b> <b>activity</b> is declining across most countries, sectors, and firm sizes between the periods 2004 / 06 and 2007 / 09. Regression analysis reveals that this decline is also significant after controlling for firm characteristics. Long-term data for Germany indicate that this decrease {{is part of a}} longer trend which already started in 2003. Despite the general decrease in offshoring, far-shoring to Asia in general and to China in particular has increased. In contrast, near-shoring to EU member states in Middle and Eastern Europe (EU- 12) became less attractive. The EU- 12, however, is still the most important target region for <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> of European firms. The dominant motive for offshoring is the wish to reduce labour costs. Expected labour cost reductions explain offshoring to the EU- 12, Asia and China in particular. Vicinity to customers and market expansion follow as a motive with a wide margin. However, in contrast to the EU- 12, where the offshoring decision is solely dominated by potential labour cost savings, <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> to Asia and China are also significantly related to market expansion motives. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{quarter to}} half of the {{manufacturing}} companies in different Western European countries performed <b>offshoring</b> of production <b>activities</b> in 2002 or 2003. In Eastern Europe production offshoring is rather uncommon. Surpris-ingly, {{it is not an}} over-proportionally frequent phenomenon in countries with the highest labour costs in Western Europe. Attempts to reduce the costs of production factors are still the dominating motive, but factors such as market opening, vicinity to key customers or securing the ability to supply locally are important, too. However, production offshoring is not necessarily an irreversi-ble one-way process. Varying from country to country, every second to sixth offshoring company is countered by a backsourcing company.
