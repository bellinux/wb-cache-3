40|$|The {{possibility}} of making precise predictions for the Casimir force {{is essential for}} the theoretical interpretation of current precision experiments on the thermal Casimir effect with metallic plates, especially for submicron separations.

This task is complicated in the case of <b>ohmic</b> <b>conductors</b> because optical data do not usually extend to sufficiently low frequencies to permit an accurate evaluation of the standard Kramers-Kronig integral used to compute (iξ). By making important improvements to the results of a previous paper by the author, it is shown that this difficulty can be resolved by considering suitable weighted dispersion relations, which strongly suppress the contribution of low frequencies. The weighted dispersion formulas presented in this paper permit us to estimate accurately the dielectric function of <b>ohmic</b> <b>conductors</b> for imaginary frequencies, on the basis of optical data extending from the IR to the UV, with no need for uncontrolled data extrapolations toward zero frequency that are necessary with standard Kramers-Kronig relations.

Our model is characterized by single electron tunneling between electrodes represented by free electron reservoirs through a system characterized by it electron levels, nuclear vibrations and their structures. We consider cooling mechasims resulting from (a) cooling of one electrode surface by tunneling induced depletion of high energy electrons; (b) cooling by coherent sub resonance electronic transport analogous to atomic laser nduced cooling and (c) the incoherent analog of process (b) - cooling by driven activated transport.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{electromagnetic interaction}} {{of a point}} charge and a magnet is discussed by first calculating the interaction of point charge with a simple model magnetic moment and then suggesting a multiparticle limit. The Darwin Lagrangian is {{used to analyze the}} electromagnetic behavior of the model magnetic moment (composed of two oppositely charged particles of different mass in an initially circular orbit) interacting with a passing point charge. The changing mangetic moment is found to put a force back on a passing charge; this force is of order 1 /c^ 2 and depends upon the magnitude of the magnetic moment. It is suggested that in the limit of a multiparticle magnetic toroid, the electric fields of the passing charge are screened out of the body of the magnet while the magnetic fields penetrate into the magnet. This is consistent with our understanding of the penetration of electromagnetic velocity fields into <b>ohmic</b> <b>conductors.</b> Conservation laws are discussed. The work corresponds to a classical electromagnetic analysis of the interaction which is basic to understanding the controversy over the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts and represents a refutation of the suggestions of Aharonov, Pearle, and Vaidman.

40|$|The {{observation}} of non-saturating classical linear magnetoresistivity {{has been an}} enigmatic phenomenon in solid state physics. We present a study of a two-dimensional <b>ohmic</b> <b>conductor,</b> including local Hall effect and a self-consistent consideration of the environment. An equivalent-circuit scheme delivers a simple and convincing argument why the magnetoresistivity is linear in strong magnetic field, provided that current and biasing electric field are misaligned by a nonlocal mechanism. A finite-element model of a two-dimensional conductor is suited to display the situations that create such deviating currents. Besides edge effects next to electrodes, charge carrier density fluctuations are efficiently generating this effect. However, mobility fluctuations that have frequently been related to linear magnetoresistivity are barely relevant. Despite its rare observation, linear magnetoresitivity is rather the rule than the exception in a regime of low charge carrier densities, misaligned current pathways and strong magnetic field.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} aluminum during cathodic polarization was investigated with the quartz crystal microbalance, to identify {{changes in the}} electrical conduction properties of the surface film, which result in strongly enhanced electrochemical reaction rates.

The critical potential for forming this ohmically conducting film agrees with the potential below which aluminum hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more stable than aluminum oxide, near the metal/film interface. The conductivity of the cathodic film is within an order of magnitude of the proton conductivity of bulk hydrated aluminum hydroxide,. When the potential is stepped above the open‐circuit potential subsequent to cathodic charging, there is a characteristic current decay during several seconds, after which the conductivity is three orders of magnitude smaller than at the cathodic potential.

40|$|The d. c, {{electrical}} properties of 80 × 80 × 3 mm 3 polypropylene plaques filled with 6. 5 µm diameter stainless steel fibres {{have been studied}} for volume fractions {{in the vicinity of}} a critical threshold at which the volume resistivity changes very rapidly with filler concentration. By the use of very low power inputs to eliminate any possibility of local temperature changes, the samples have been established to be <b>ohmic</b> <b>conductors</b> with resistivities ranging from 12 to 0. 61 O cm for fibre volume fractions of 1 to 3 %. It is suggested that percolation conditions i. e. continuous chains of metal fibres are produced at low volume fraction of filler because of a special fibre geometry i. e. a substantial proportion of the fibres are three dimensionally folded into shapes of roughly helical form, thus enhancing the probabilities of contact between adjacent fibres. For simplicity a model structure of perfect helices with identical diameters and pitch has been examined. The model leads to a critical volume fraction at the percolation threshold, which is in good agreement with experiment and proportional to the square of the ratio of fibre diameter to helix diameter. The threshold resistivity range predicted by the model is also a function of fibre and helix diameter and this resistivity also decreases with mean fibre length. It is argued further that there exists an optimum value of fibre aspect ratio for which the critical volume fraction is a minimum. The predicted threshold resistivity is in good agree ment with experiment providing that a small amount of the size coating is assumed to have been removed during manufacture of the plaques, thus allowing {{a small fraction of the}} fibre fibre contacts to be conducting...|$|R
50|$|While many cables {{have a solid}} {{dielectric}}, {{many others}} have a foam dielectric that contains as much air or other gas as possible to reduce the losses by allowing {{the use of a}} larger diameter center conductor. Foam coax will have about 15% less attenuation but some types of foam dielectric can absorb moisture - especially at its many surfaces — in humid environments, significantly increasing the loss. Supports shaped like stars or spokes are even better but more expensive and very susceptible to moisture infiltration. Still more expensive were the air-spaced coaxials used for some inter-city communications in the mid-20th century. The center conductor was suspended by polyethylene discs every few centimeters. In some low-loss coaxial cables such as the RG-62 type, the inner conductor is supported by a spiral strand of polyethylene, so that an air space exists between most of the conductor and the inside of the jacket. The lower dielectric constant of air allows for a greater inner diameter at the same impedance and a greater outer diameter at the same cutoff frequency, lowering <b>ohmic</b> losses. Inner <b>conductors</b> are sometimes silver-plated to smooth the surface and reduce losses due to skin effect. A rough surface prolongs the path for the current and concentrates the current at peaks and, thus, increases ohmic losses.|$|R

The spectra for the cathodic products compare most favorably to that of the porous, amorphous oxide films formed by anodizing in acid solution. Aluminum ions in the film are highly coordinated to hydroxyl groups. The OH groups or H[subscript] 2 O molecules of the film are readily accessible to exchange by D[subscript] 2 O indicating that the film has an 2 ̆ 2 open 2 ̆ 2 structure;Cathodic charging of aluminum in acid solution induced an anodic current transient in the passive potential region, accompanied by electrode mass increase, which was primarily due to water absorption into the film.

40|$|The Taylor-Melcher (TM) {{model is}} the {{standard}} model for describing the dynamics of poorly conducting leaky dielectric fluids under an electric field. The TM model treats the fluid as an <b>Ohmic</b> <b>conductor,</b> without modeling ion dynamics. On the other hand, electrodiffusion models, which {{have been successful in}} describing electrokinetic phenomena, incorporates ionic concentration dynamics. Mathematical reconciliation of the electrodiffusion picture and the TM model has been a major issue for electrohydrodynamic theory. Here, we derive the TM model from an electrodiffusion model in which we explicitly model the electrochemistry of ion dissociation. We introduce salt dissociation reaction terms in the bulk electrodiffusion equation and take the limit in which the salt dissociation is weak; the assumption of weak dissociation corresponds {{to the fact that the}} TM model describes poor conductors. Together with the assumption that the Debye length is small, we derive the TM model with or without the surface charge convection term depending upon the scaling of relevant dimensionless parameters. An important quantity that emerges is the Galvani potential (GP), the jump in voltage across the liquid-liquid interface; the GP arises as a natural consequence of the interfacial boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations, and may be absent under certain parametric conditions. When the GP is absent, we recover the TM model. In the presence of a non-zero GP our model predicts that the liquid droplet will drift under an electric field, the velocity of which is computed explicitly to leading order...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Here {{we present}} {{the design of}} a low loss top metal silicon (Si) hybrid dielectric-loaded {{plasmonic}} waveguide (TM-SiHDLW) and a compact, high performance optical resonator by numerical simulation based on finite element method. The waveguide adopted a thick (200 nm) top metal stripe structure to yield optimal performance due to reduced <b>Ohmic</b> loss in <b>conductor</b> around the stripe edge/corner. Moreover, a relatively thick (150 nm) dielectric spacer between the Si ridge and the metal stripe was employed to achieve both long propagation length and good field confinement. The effect of a thin (10 nm) silicon nitride (SiNx) layer covering the waveguide which was added for minimizing uncertainties on optical properties of SiHDLW resulting from high density of dangling bonds on Si surface was also investigated. Simulation results show that there is no significant degradation on the performance of the TM-SiHDLW. For the proposed plasmonic waveguide, a propagation length of 0. 35 mm and a mode area around 0. 029 µm 2 were demonstrated. The TM-SiHDLW waveguide was then used as the basis for an optical resonator, which was designed to operate at the fundamental TE 011 mode for yielding high quality factor at a relatively small footprint size. A metal enclosure was also adopted to reduce the radiation loss, and a high quality factor of ∼ 1900 was obtained, more than double the results in other disk or ring resonators of comparable size. Compared to the resonators based on a rounded top metal Si hybrid dielectric-loaded plasmonic waveguide (RTM-SiHDLW) which has a much longer propagation length than the TM-SiHDLW, as reported in our previous work, the performance is essentially the same. This is simply because, for the resonators, the radiation loss is the dominate loss mechanism and the dissipation in the waveguide structure itself, thus, contribute little to the final quality factor of the plasmonic resonators. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a 3 G/GSM dual-system Radio-On-a-Chip for mobile handsets in CMOS technology depends on the GSM transmitter’s compliance with the receive-band noise mandated by the standard. An integrated direct conversion solution eliminates filtering at the intermediate frequency stage, requiring a low-noise transmitter chain. The transmitter synthesizer is the main noise contributor due to the high phase noise of the voltage controlled oscillators integrated in CMOS technology. While the integrated LC-oscillators have a better phase noise performance than the ring-oscillators, the high loss of the integrated inductor has prevented the fully integrated solution in GSM transmitters so far. The compromise solution consists of an integrated active circuit coupled with an off-chip, discrete resonator. The thesis motivation was to implement novel design techniques and achieve completely integrated oscillator in CMOS technology, capable of meeting the strict receive-band noise requirements of GSM mobile handset. An integrated oscillator operating at frequencies sufficiently higher than the transmit carrier frequency has two main benefits: the immunity from power-amplifier output injection locking, and higher Q-values of integrated inductors. The oscillator phase noise at large offsets depends on the resonator Q-value, {{which in turn is}} dominated by the integrated inductor Q-value. In addition, the phase noise is inversely proportional to the power in the resonator, achieved by a large voltage swing across the differential nodes. However, a large voltage swing across the resonator varactor modulates its capacitance due to the nonlinear voltage-to-capacitance function. This effect increases the phase noise at close offsets through the AM-to-FM noise conversion mechanism. An optimum solution is an oscillator achieving the phase noise requirements at all offsets. The problem of varactor capacitance modulation due to the large voltage swing is fairly new phenomena, expected to be encountered more frequently in the future as the supply voltages become lower and oscillator tuning ranges become larger. The expressions of the effective capacitance and modulation are derived for a variety of C(V) -curve-linearization techniques, aimed at reducing the modulation while keeping the varactor tuning range intact. Novel technique of anti-parallel varactor branches, which are non-symmetric about the tuning line, is presented and confirmed in a prototype design. The varactor elements of each branch have different reactance, and therefore experience different voltage amplitude. When optimized, the varactor element having a more nonlinear C(V) function will experience lower voltage amplitude while a more linear element will experience a larger amplitude. This will lead to an overall lower capacitance modulation. The branches are placed in anti-parallel manner across the oscillator differential nodes, maintaining the large differential swing and symmetry, while lowering the AM-to-FM noise conversion, i. e. the close-in phase noise. In order to keep the far-out phase noise low integrated inductor is optimized by trading its physical size for higher performance. The performed research indicates that an integrated inductor of large physical size and low inductance value operated at higher frequency can achieve Q-values 2 - 3 times larger than those at GSM transmit carrier frequency. It is desirable that the designs are portable across different foundries, i. e. maintain the performance independent of the semiconductor process chosen. The inductor losses can be grouped into <b>ohmic,</b> i. e. <b>conductor</b> losses, and losses due to the electromagnetic radiation and coupling, dominated by the substrate loss. Methodology for fast identification of loss mechanisms in integrated inductors is developed, based on the element values of standard single-π network inductor model. The presented theory is practically confirmed through a test chip. The close-in phase noise of a reference oscillator design incorporating a traditional varactor is compared to the oscillator design with the new varactor topology. The close-in phase noise profiles measured on a test chip compare closely with the derived theory. The novel oscillator experiences less varactor capacitance modulation, and has a flatter phase noise across the tuning range. The reference oscillator suffers from strong capacitance modulation, and its close-in phase noise profile corresponds to that predicted by the theory and previous works, having a non-monotonic shape across the tuning range. The resonator of the reference oscillator has a higher Q-value and therefore has a better far-out noise performance at same biasing conditions. Therefore, the inductor characteristics dominate the far-out phase noise, and the varactor characteristics dominate the close-in phase noise in the large voltage swing oscillator. The last part of this thesis presents the results of a case study of the enhanced LC-tank resonators. The topology is modified such that oscillator overharmonics are either filtered or boosted within the resonator. The result is a lower phase noise and a possibility of an overharmonic oscillator. This novel technique relies on a harmonic analysis of enhanced LC-tank, and is an attractive topic for further research. Dr. philos...|$|R
