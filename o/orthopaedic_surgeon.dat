The study seeks to understand the resistance shown towards podiatric surgery by <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> and {{to determine if there}} is a willingness among <b>orthopaedic</b> and podiatric <b>surgeons,</b> respectively, to develop a more satisfactory working relationship. Two methods of data collection were employed to gather information on the views of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> on podiatric surgery. Firstly, questionnaires were sent to all Fellows of the British Orthopaedic Association with the intention to collect a breadth of data. In this way a total population was contacted by means of the survey. Secondly, personal interviews were undertaken with fifty <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> who indicated a willingness to take part in their questionnaire responses. These interviews were designed to add richness and depth to the data gathered from the questionnaires. All podiatric surgeons in the UK were also sent questionnaires in order to investigate their professional experiences with, and their attitudes towards, <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Once again, a total population was surveyed. A range of attitudes towards podiatric surgery was found among <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> but significant opposition was identified. Reasons for this opposition are multi-factorial and complex. Overall, there appears to be an imperative to maintain control and, therefore, medical dominance over a competing occupation. For some <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> this control is perceived as necessary if the prestige and status of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> are to be protected. For others, collaboration with podiatric surgeons is a possibility although many <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> have reservations about a formal union which often result from a lack of understanding about many aspects of podiatric surgery. Podiatric surgeons are generally in favour of developing closer links with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> though they have concerns about a possible loss of autonomy arising from any collaboration.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{ongoing process}} of {{population}} aging {{is associated with}} an increase in prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions with a concomitant increase in the demand of orthopaedic services. Shortages of orthopaedic services have been documented in Canada and elsewhere. This population-based study describes the number of patients seen by <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> in office and hospital settings to set the scene for the development of strategies that could maximize the availability of orthopaedic resources. Methods Administrative data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital separation databases for the 2005 / 06 fiscal year were used to identify individuals accessing orthopaedic services in Ontario, Canada. The number of patients with encounters with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> the number of encounters and the number of surgeries carried out by <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> were estimated according to condition groups, service location, patient's age and sex. Results In 2005 / 06, over 520, 000 Ontarians (41 per 1, 000 population) had over 1. 3 million encounters with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Of those 86 % were ambulatory encounters and 14 % were in hospital encounters. The majority of ambulatory encounters were for an injury or related condition (44 %) followed by arthritis and related conditions (37 %). Osteoarthritis accounted for 16 % of all ambulatory encounters. <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> carried out over 140, 000 surgeries in 2005 / 06 : joint replacement accounted for 25 % of all orthopaedic surgeries, whereas closed repair accounted for 16 % and reductions accounted for 21 %. Half of the orthopaedic surgeries were for arthritis and related conditions. Conclusion The large volume of ambulatory care points to the significant contribution of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> to the medical management of chronic musculoskeletal conditions including arthritis and injuries. The findings highlight that surgery is only one component of the work of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> in the management of these conditions. Policy makers and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> need to be creative in developing strategies to accommodate the growing workload of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> without sacrificing quality of care of patients with musculoskeletal conditions. </p...|$|R

The character gradually softened, and Akingbola portrays him as being fundamentally good-hearted. Malick is gay; he develops a rivalry with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeon</b> Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill), who later kisses him during a fight.

25|$|A {{domestic}} abuse case tests Malick's temper. Suspecting an injured husband of beating his wife, Malick switches his pain-relieving morphine for saline {{to increase his}} suffering. When Penny is killed in a train crash, her brother Oliver (James Anderson) confides in Malick {{that he is not}} a qualified doctor, as he switched his own exam paper with Penny's while they were at university. Malick dissuades Oliver from confessing to Hanssen, and agrees to keep his secret. Hanssen transfers Malick from the AAU to Keller, the hospital's general surgery ward. There, he attempts to ingratiate himself with consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), but discord arises between the two when Ric insinuates that Malick performed a hysterectomy on a drug-addicted mother out of spite rather than medical necessity. Malick also comes into conflict with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeon</b> Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill) over treatment of a patient, which intensifies when he discovers that Dan has been illegally providing an old friend with steroids. A physical altercation ensues, which results in Dan kissing Malick, before running off to be with his girlfriend, ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: End-stage knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{results in}} total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. The decision to perform TKA {{is not well}} defined, resulting in variation of indications among <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Non-operative treatment measures are often not extensively used. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate factors influencing the decision to perform TKA by Dutch <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Methods: Three case vignettes, each case divided into two versions, being identical except for information on age (younger and older age), pain (mild and severe pain) or radiological OA (low and high grade) were developed. A questionnaire including these three case vignettes was sent to 599 Dutch <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> who were randomised to either one of the two versions. The <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> were asked whether TKA would be the next step in treatment. Furthermore, from a list of patient factors they were asked how strong these factors would influence the decision to perform TKA. Results: 54  % of the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> completed the questionnaire (n =  326). <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> indicated to perform TKA significantly more often at higher age (73. 3 vs. 45. 5  %, p <  0. 001). In the presence of mild pain, <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> were slightly more reluctant to perform a TKA compared to severe pain (57. 0 vs. 64. 0  %, n. s.). Mild radiological OA made surgeons more reluctant to perform TKA compared to severe OA (9. 7 vs. 96. 9  %, p <  0. 001). Conclusion: Old age and severe radiological OA are variables which are considered to be important in the decision to perform a TKA. Pain symptoms of moderate or severe pain are unequivocal when considering a TKA. Level of evidence: Economic/decision analysis, Level III...|$|R

500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeon,</b> and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s {{research}} was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised {{a method of}} constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the soft tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeon,</b> Per-Ingvar Brånemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed [...] "rabbit ear chamber" [...] {{for use in the}} rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Brånemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Brånemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, {{was one of the first}} to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Brånemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as [...] "osseointegration".|$|E

500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeon,</b> and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists. Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.|$|E

40|$|Background Physicians in China face heavy {{demands from}} {{patients}} {{and the government}} for services but deal {{with the threat of}} unpredictable legal and physical conflicts with patients, some ending with the death of doctors. More than 40 doctors and nurses have been killed by patients since 2001. Questions/purposes We sought to evaluate (1) the demographics of orthopaedic practice, (2) duty periods, (3) practice support, and (4) job satisfaction among <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> in China. Methods Questionnaires were posted online at www. OrthoChina. org for download by <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> in 2006 to 2007, and sent to those attending meetings in 2013. In 2013, a total of 1350 surgeons were invited and 456 participated in the survey at meetings. In 2007, during the period of the survey, 9759 individuals were qualified <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> and 334 participated in the survey at www. OrthoChina. org. Results Ninety-one percent of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> work in public and 9 % in private hospitals. Ninety-four percent work more than 8 hours per day 6 to 7 days a week. Twenty-five percent work more than 12 hours per day 6 to 7 days a week without extra compensation. The majority of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> must work on national statutory holidays. Almost none received contractually mandated income for weekends and national holidays. Approxi-mately 80 % of participants reported an attack of some kind, including physical or psychologic harm. With respect to job satisfaction, 73 % stated they would not choose to be a physician again and 86 % reported that they do not want their children to become a physician. Conclusions China’s rapid economic growth and result-ing demands for modern health care have resulted in heavy pressure on <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons,</b> financially and person-ally. Chinese <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeons</b> are overworked, suffer lack of respect, and face the possibility of serious personal harm. As a consequence, they are demoralized and unsat-isfied.
