50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} goblin sharks is the long, trowel-shaped, beak-like snout, much longer than those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> The snout contains sensory organs to detect the electrical signals given off by the shark's prey. They also possess long, protrusible jaws. When the jaws are retracted, the shark resembles a grey nurse shark, Carcharias taurus, with an unusually long nose. Its nose resembles the nose of a goblin, which is how it received its name. These sharks have only been seen about 50 times since their discovery in 1897. They are {{also known as the}} vampire sharks or ghost sharks because of their pale color and their dislike for sunlight which makes them deep-sea dwellers. This results in very few sightings of them.|$|E

50|$|Squalus is a genus of {{dogfish sharks}} {{in the family}} Squalidae. Commonly known as spurdogs, these sharks are {{characterized}} by smooth dorsal fin spines, teeth in upper and lower jaws similar in size, caudal peduncle with lateral keels; upper precaudal pit usually present, and caudal fin without subterminal notch. In spurdogs, the hyomandibula (the bone connecting the braincase to the jaws) is oriented at a right angle to the neurocranium, while in other sharks, the hyomandibula runs more parallel to the body. This led some {{to think that the}} upper jaw of Squalus would not be as protractile as the jaws <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> However, a study that compared different jaw suspension types in sharks showed {{that this is not the}} case and that Squalus is quite capable of protruding its upper jaw during feeding.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{rolling on}} their sides to rip off chunks of prey, lemon sharks {{approach}} their victim with speed only to brake suddenly using their pectoral fins upon contact. The animal then jabs forward multiple times until it has a good grasp of its prey in its jaw and proceeds to shake its {{head from side to}} side until it tears off a chunk of flesh. A feeding frenzy, or large swarm <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> then forms as the individuals sense the blood and bodily fluids released from the prey. Sounds of struggling prey also attract groups of sharks, suggesting they use sound detection for predation. Group feeding behavior such as pack hunting or communal scavenging was observed in a study in which pieces of the same stingray were found in the stomachs of several lemon shark individuals that were caught and examined.|$|E
50|$|While {{the forward}} {{part of the}} angel shark's body is broad and flattened, the rear part retains a muscular {{appearance}} more typical <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> The eyes and spiracles are on top and the five gill slits are on its back. Both the pectorals and the pelvic fins are large and held horizontally. There are two dorsal fins, no anal fin and unusually for sharks, the lower lobe of the caudal fin is longer than the upper lobe. Most types grow to a length of 1.5 m (5 ft), with the Japanese angel shark, known to reach 2 m.Angel sharks possess extensible jaws that can rapidly snap upwards to capture prey and have long, needle-like teeth. They bury themselves in sand or mud lying in wait for prey, which includes fish, crustaceans and various types of mollusks. They are ovoviviparous, producing litters of up to 13 pups.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the southwestern}} Australian {{biodiversity}} hotspot, the Shark Bay region displays {{high levels of}} plant and animal endemism, particularly in the herpetofauna. The region has been subjected to dramatic climatic fluctuations and has been geologically active from the Late Miocene to the present. The myobatrachid frog Arenophryne rotunda, a Shark Bay endemic, provides an ideal opportunity to examine the relative effects of fluctuating climates and geological activity on the biota of Shark Bay. A comprehensive phylogeographic analysis of A. rotunda, based on data comprising 1154 bp of the mitochondrial gene ND 2, is presented. My results demonstrate a major genetic break that divides this species at the northern edge of the Victorian Plateau into northern and southern species lineages, dating to the Late Miocene, with a further division of the southern species lineage across the Murchison Gorge dating to the Plio-Pleistocene border. Both of these periods are related to prominent geological activity and climatic shifts in the Shark Bay region. Interpretation of phylogeographic results point to the prominent role of fluctuating Pleistocene climates and associated coastal landscape evolution in the generation of phylogeographic structure within the distinct A. rotunda species lineages.

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} species-specific landings data is {{an essential}} step toward achieving sustainable shark fisheries. Globally distributed sharpnose sharks (genus Rhizoprionodon) exhibit life-history characteristics (rapid growth, early maturity, annual reproduction) that suggests {{that they could be}} fished in a sustainable manner assuming an investment in monitoring, assessment and careful management. However, obtaining species-specific landings data for sharpnose sharks is problematic because they are morphologically very similar to one another. Moreover, sharpnose sharks may also be confused with other small sharks (either small species or juveniles of large species) once they are processed (i. e., the head and fins are removed). Here we present a highly streamlined molecular genetics approach based on seven species-specific PCR primers in a multiplex format that can simultaneously discriminate body parts from the seven described sharpnose shark species commonly occurring in coastal fisheries worldwide. The species-specific primers are based on nucleotide sequence differences among species in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus (ITS 2). This approach also distinguishes sharpnose sharks from a wide range <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> (52 species) and can therefore assist in the regulation o...|$|E
30|$|Details of the netting {{operation}} {{to protect the}} popular beaches of KZN used extensively for water-based activities are given in Cliff and Dudley (1992). All sharks found dead in the nets {{were taken to the}} laboratories of the KZNSB, where they were identified by expert staff, and the carcasses either dissected immediately, or frozen for future dissection. During dissection approximately 20 Â g samples were collected from the liver (upper portion of the left lobe), heart (base of the ventricle) and abdominal muscle (adjacent to the left pectoral fin), placed into labeled glass vials and frozen at â 20 Â°C. Previously, samples had been taken from three distinct and separate sites in livers <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> and no differences in total lipid or fatty acid profile demonstrated irrespective of sample site (Davidson et al. 2011 b). Samples were collected, either by the first author or by KZNSB staff, from individual sharks between 2002 and 2007. Since all samples were taken post mortem and no sharks were purposely killed for this study there were no ethical considerations and ethical clearance was not deemed necessary by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.|$|E

The shark, which measures about 140 mm at birth, attains 260, 380, 470, 530 and 590 mm {{at the end of}} 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years respectively after birth.

40|$|Background. The {{directed}} {{harvest and}} global {{trade in the}} gill plates of mantas, and devil rays, has led to increased fishing pressure and steep population declines in some locations. The slow life history, particularly of the manta rays, is cited as a key reason why such species have little capacity to withstand directed fisheries. Here, we place their life history and demography within the context <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays. Methods. Despite the limited availability of data, we use life history theory and comparative analysis to estimate the intrinsic risk of extinction (as indexed by the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase rmax) for a typical generic manta ray using {{a variant of the}} classic EulerâLotka demographic model. This model requires only three traits to calculate the maximum intrinsic population growth rate rmax: von Bertalanffy growth rate, annual pup production and age at maturity. To account for the uncertainty in life history parameters, we created plausible parameter ranges and propagate these uncertainties through the model to calculate a distribution of the plausible range of rmax values. Results. The maximum population growth rate rmax of manta ray is most sensitive to the length of the reproductive cycle, and the median rmax of 0. 116 yearâ 1 95 th percentile [0. 089 â 0. 139] is one of the lowest known of the 106 sharks and rays for which we have comparable demographic information. Discussion. In common with other unprotected, unmanaged, high-value large-bodied sharks and rays the combination of very low population growth rates of manta rays, combined with the high value of their gill rakers and the international nature of trade, is highly likely to lead to rapid depletion and potential local extinction unless a rapid conservation management response occurs worldwide. Furthermore, we show {{that it is possible to}} derive important insights into the demography extinction risk of data-poor species using well-established life history theory...|$|E
40|$|Retinofugal {{pathways}} in fetal {{and adult}} spiny dogfish {{were determined by}} intra-ocular injection of [3 H]proline for autoradiography. Distribution and termination of the primary retinal efferents were identical in pups and adults. The retinal fibers decussate completely, except for a sparse ipsilateral projection to the caudal preoptic area. The decussating optic fibers terminate ventrally in the preoptic area and in two rostral thalamic areas, a lateral neuropil area of the dorsal thalamus and more ventrally in the lateral half of the ventral thalamus. At this same rostral thalamic level, a second optic pathway, the medial optic tract, splits from the lateral marginal optic tract and courses dorsomedially to terminate in the rostral tectum and the central and peri-ventricular pretectal nuclei. The marginal optic tract continues caudally to terminate in a superficial pretectal nucleus and also innervates the superficial zone of the optic tectum. A basal optic tract arises from the ventral edge of the marginal optic tract and courses medially into the central pretectal nucleus, as well as continuing more caudally to terminate in a dorsal neuropil adjacent o nucleus interstitialis and in a more ventrally and medially located basal optic nucleus. Comparison of the retinofugal projections of Squalus with those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> reveals two grades of neural organization with respect o primary visual projections. Squalomorph sharks possess a rostral dorsal thalamic nucleus whose visual input is primarily, if not solely, axodendritic, and an optic tectum in which {{the majority of the}} cell bodies are located deep to the visual terminal zone. In contrast, galeomorph sharks are characterized by an enlarged and migrated rostrodorsal thalamic visual nucleus, and an optic rectum in which the majority of the cell bodies are located within the visual terminal zone.

40|$|The {{shortfin mako}} (Isurus oxyrinchus) {{is a highly}} migratory pelagic shark that {{preferentially}} inhabits oceanic regions in practically all oceans. The wide distribution range of this species renders it susceptible to coastal and oceanic fishing operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) consider this species to be highly vulnerable, especially due to its biological parameters, which {{are different from those}} <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> that occupy the same niche (e. g., Prionace glauca). Consequently, considerable declines in abundance have been detected over various parts of its range, most of which are linked to oceanic longline fishing. The species has conflicting life history parameters in studies conducted in the last 30 years, especially with regard to age and growth. The main discrepancies regard the interpretation of the periodicity of the deposition of band pairs (BPs) on vertebrae and the possibility of ontogenetic variations in growth. Shortfin mako sharks (n = 1325) were sampled by onboard observers of the Brazilian chartered pelagic longline fleet based in northeast Brazil from 2005 to 2011. Lengths were 79 to 250 and 73 to 296 cm (fork length, FL) for males and females, respectively, with a statistically significant difference in size between sexes and differences in the proportion of individuals in each size class. The onboard observers collected a subsample of vertebrae (n = 467), only 234 of which were suitable for analyses. Reliability between readings was satisfactory. However, {{it was not possible to}} validate periodicity in the formation of age bands in the sample. Thus, the von Bertalanffy growth function was used to calculate growth rates for the species through the interpretation of BPs in different scenarios: one BP per year (s 1), two BPs per year (s 2) and two BPs per year until five years of life (s 3). Growth parameters varied for both females (Linf = 309. 7 [s 3] to 441. 6 [s 1]; k = 0. 04 [s 1] to 0. 13 [s 3]; t 0 = - 7. 08 [s 1] and - 3. 27 [s 3]) and males (Linf = 291. 5 [s 3] to 340. 2 [s 1]; k = 0. 04 [s 1] to 0. 13 [s 3]; t 0 = - 7. 08 [s 1] and - 3. 27 [s 3]). To advance the understanding of the use of habitat, the first analysis of the spatial distribution of the life stages of the shortfin mako sharks caught by commercial longline fishing operations in the South Atlantic was performed. The findings indicate that the portion of the population exploited by the fleets is predominantly juvenile and future actions should take the following issues into account: improvements in the efficiency of data collection procedures, the reestablishment of the onboard observer program, emergency investments in studies that can contribute to a better understanding of habitat use and life history theory...|$|E
