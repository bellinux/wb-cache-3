50|$|Before flight, the {{transceiver}} {{was set up}} with {{a selected}} day code of ten bits which was dialed into the unit. To start the identification procedure, the ground <b>operator</b> <b>switched</b> the pulse frequency of his radar from 3,750 Hz to 5,000 Hz. The airborne receiver decoded that and started to transmit the day code. The radar operator would then see the blip lengthen and shorten in the given code, ensuring it was not being spoofed. The IFF transmitter worked on 168 MHz with a power of 400 watts (PEP).|$|E

50|$|The {{primitive}} {{spark gap}} radio transmitters {{used during the}} first three decades of radio (1886-1916) could not transmit audio (sound) and instead transmitted information by wireless telegraphy; the <b>operator</b> <b>switched</b> the transmitter on and off with a telegraph key, creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in Morse code. So the radio receiving equipment of the time did not have to convert the radio waves into sound like modern receivers, but merely detect {{the presence or absence of}} the radio signal. The device that did this was called a detector. The first widely used detector was the coherer, invented in 1890.|$|E

40|$|Efficacy {{and safety}} of tornus {{catheter}} in percutaneous coronary intervention of hard or balloon-uncrossable chronic total occlusionDOI: ND URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SI Inclòs a la memòria: SIBACKGROUND: Balloon advancement and dilation through chronic total occlusion segment could be challenging in some cases after successful wire crossing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate efficacy {{and safety of}} Tornus catheter (Asahi Intecc; Aichi, Japan) in percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusion in hard or balloon-uncrossable chronic total occlusion. METHODS: The present study is a retrospective and descriptive analysis of 14 hard or balloon-uncrossable chronic total occlusions treated percutaneously in our catheterization laboratory (cathlab). Tornus catheter was used to penetrate and eventually cross the chronic total occlusion segment. Procedure success was defined when Tornus penetrated at least partly into chronic total occlusion segment making possible the subsequent balloon dilatation and stent implantation achieving a final TIMI III angiographic result with residual stenosis less than 30 %. Switch to other microcatheter was considered as an unsuccessful procedure. Complications associated with the Tornus use were analyzed in order to evaluate device safety. RESULTS: The average age of patients was 65. 2 ± 9. 6 and 11 out of 14 (78. 6 %) were male. In 7 (50 %) cases, Tornus was used after an unsuccessful balloon passage through occluded segment. In 11 (78. 6 %) out of 14 cases the procedure was successful and in 3 (21. 4 %) cases, the <b>operator</b> <b>switched</b> to another microcatheter to continue with the procedure. No complication occurred during all procedures. CONCLUSION: Tornus catheter can be effectively and safely used in a subgroup of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusion with hard or balloon-uncrossable lesions and could facilitate the treatment of this type of lesions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that transradial (TRI) {{as compared to}} transfemoral (TFI) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with improved clinical outcome driven by less hemorrhagic complications, in particular in STEMI patients receiving aggressive antithrombotic treatment. Feasibility rate of TRI in STEMI patients {{has not yet been}} evaluated. METHODS/RESULTS: Four-hundred seventy-five consecutive STEMI patients (< 12 h) without cardiogenic shock were prospectively screened for this all-comer single-centre registry between January 2008 and August 2010. Nine patients were excluded for a priori ineligibility for TRI (forearm shunt for dialysis, prior TRI failure). In the 466 patients enrolled, the operator's opinion about ease of radial puncture was assessed in 4 categories, based on radial pulse quality. Operators were advised not to attempt TRI if ease of puncture was judged "probably difficult/impossible". In case of puncture failure the <b>operator</b> <b>switched</b> immediately to TFI. The mean age of patients was 61 ± 14 (range 27 - 94) years. Seventy-three percent were men, 17 % had diabetes. Nine percent had previous PCI. Glycoprotein inhibitors were used in 70 %, and thrombectomy was performed in 70 % of patients. PCI was performed using 6 F and 5 F guiding catheters. Procedural success rate was 98. 2 % (TIMI flow≥ 2). In 4. 1 % (n= 19) of patients the operator judged ease of radial puncture "probably difficult/impossible" and no TRI attempt was performed (primary TFI). In the 447 patients with TRI attempt, TRI failure requiring switch to TFI (secondary TFI) was necessary in 22 patients (4. 7 % of total) following radial puncture failure (n= 15), dissection of the radial artery (n= 1), prohibitive tortuosities or stenosis of the upper limb axis (n= 2), or non-selective position or lack of stability of the guiding catheter (n= 2). After the start of the angioplasty procedure, switch from TR to TF was not necessary in any patient. In total, the overall feasibility rate of TRI was 91. 2 %. Independent predictors of final TFI were age≥ 80 years (adjusted OR: 2. 37; 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 5. 34, p= 0. 037), body weight< 60 kg (adjusted OR: 2. 84; 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 6. 59, p= 0. 015); and previous PCI (adjusted OR: 3. 42; 95 % CI: 1. 40 - 8. 37, p= 0. 007); female gender was borderline significant (adjusted OR: 2. 10; 95 % CI: 0. 97 - 4. 54, p= 0. 059). CONCLUSION: In STEMI patients without cardiogenic shock and without a priori indication for TFI, PCI can be performed via the radial artery in more than 90 % of cases with high procedural success rate. Operator's judgement of eligibility for TRI based on radial pulse quality is predictive of successful TRI in 95 % of cases. TR failure is significantly more common in the elderly and in patients with low body weight...|$|E

5000|$|In {{continuous}} wave (CW) radio transmission, also called radiotelegraphy or on-off keying and {{designated by the}} International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A, information is transmitted by pulses of unmodulated radio carrier wave which spell out text messages in Morse code.
