5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic <b>oxime</b> derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E

30|$|Synthesis of <b>oximes</b> is an {{important}} reaction in organic chemistry, because these versatile <b>oximes</b> are used for protection, purification, and characterization of carbonyl compounds.

50|$|<b>Oximes</b> can be {{synthesized}} by condensation of an aldehyde or a ketone with hydroxylamine. The condensation of aldehydes with hydroxylamine gives aldoxime, and ketoxime {{is produced}} from ketones and hydroxylamine. In general, <b>oximes</b> exist as colorless crystals and are poorly soluble in water. Therefore, <b>oximes</b> {{can be used}} for the identification of ketone or aldehyde.|$|R
25|$|The Beckmann {{rearrangement}}, {{named after}} the German chemist Ernst Otto Beckmann (1853–1923), is an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of an <b>oxime</b> to an amide. Cyclic oximes yield lactams.|$|E
25|$|This example {{reaction}} {{starting with}} cyclohexanone, forming the reaction intermediate cyclohexanone <b>oxime</b> and resulting in caprolactam {{is one of}} the most important applications of the Beckmann rearrangement, as caprolactam is the feedstock in the production of Nylon 6.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is useful in}} the purification of ketones and aldehydes: if hydroxylamine is added to an aldehyde or ketone in solution, an <b>oxime</b> forms, which generally precipitates from solution; heating the precipitate with an inorganic acid then restores the original aldehyde or ketone.|$|E
50|$|The use of CaO for {{preparation}} of <b>oximes</b> {{has also been}} examined.

25|$|The {{most widely}} practiced {{conversion}} of limonene is to carvone.

25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an <b>oxime</b> or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The <b>oxime</b> is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{ability of}} two newly {{developed}} <b>oximes</b> (K 727, K 733) to reduce tabun-induced acute neurotoxic {{signs and symptoms}} was evaluated and compared with currently available trimedoxime in rats. Methods: The neuroprotective effects of the <b>oximes</b> studied combined with atropine on Wistar rats poisoned with tabun at a lethal dose (380 μg/kg i. m.; 90 % of LD 50 value) were evaluated. Tabun-induced neurotoxicity was monitored by the functional observational battery consisting of 38 measurements of sensory, motor and autonomic nervous functions at 2 hours following tabun challenge. Results: All tested <b>oximes</b> combined with atropine enable tabun-poisoned rats to survive {{till the end of}} experiment. Both newly developed <b>oximes</b> (K 727, K 733) combined with atropine were able to decrease tabun-induced neurotoxicity in the case of lethal poisoning although they did not eliminate all tabun-induced acute neurotoxic signs and symptoms. Conclusion: The ability of both novel bispyridinium <b>oximes</b> to decrease tabun-induced acute neurotoxicity was slightly lower than that of trimedoxime. Therefore, the newly developed <b>oximes</b> are not suitable for the replacement of commonly used <b>oximes</b> such as trimedoxime in the treatment of acute tabun poisonings...|$|R

25|$|Usually the gamma-emitting tracer used in {{functional}} brain imaging is 99mTc-HMPAO (hexamethylpropylene amine <b>oxime,</b> exametazime). The similar 99mTc-EC tracer {{may also}} be used.

In another, functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out while the person with ORS listened to both neutral words and emotive words. Compared to an age and sex matched healthy control subject under the same conditions, the individual with ORS showed more activation areas in the brain when listening to emotionally loaded words. This difference was described as abnormal, but less pronounced as would be observed in the brain of a person with a psychotic disorder.|$|E

30|$|<b>Oximes</b> and semicarbazones {{are used}} {{not only for}} the isolation, {{purification}} and characterization, but also for the protection of carbonyl compounds [17, 18]. Since <b>oximes</b> can be prepared from non-carbonyl compounds [19, 20, 21], the regeneration of carbonyl compounds from <b>oximes</b> provides an alternative method for the preparation of aldehydes and ketones. In addition, <b>oximes</b> can be used as intermediates for the preparation of nitriles [22, 23, 24], nitrones [25], amines [26], amides [27], isoxazoles [28] and chiral α-sulfinyl <b>oximes</b> [29]. Because of their remarkable stability to neutral and basic conditions [30, 31], acylals (1, 1 -diacetates) have been introduced as the other suitable protection group for aldehydes. In addition, they can be converted into other useful functional groups by reaction with appropriate nucleophiles [32] and used as carbonyl surrogates for asymmetric synthesis [33]. 1, 1 -Diacetates, on the other hand, are ambient substrates containing two types of reactive carbon centers, the carbon atom of the protected aldehyde function and the carbonyl group in the ester moieties [34]. To {{the best of our knowledge}} and in spite of the above-mentioned important applicabilities of <b>oximes,</b> semicarbazones and acylals, there is no report about the preparation of biscoumarins using these types of substrates.|$|R
25|$|In alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, {{a primary}} or {{secondary}} amine {{adds to the}} carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a carbinolamine. In {{the case of a}} primary amine, a water molecule can be eliminated from the carbinolamine intermediate to yield an imine or its trimer, a hexahydrotriazine This reaction is catalyzed by acid. Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this will result in an <b>oxime.</b> An ammonia derivative of the form H2NNR2 such as hydrazine (H2NNH2) or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a hydrazone, which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and ketones.|$|E
25|$|In one study, the {{mechanism}} is established in silico {{taking into account}} the presence of solvent molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone <b>oxime</b> in the Beckmann solution involves three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an oxonium ion). In the transition state leading to the iminium ion (σ-complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a concerted reaction and the hydroxyl group is expulsed. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by the three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and the proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the N-methyl acetimidic acid, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the amide.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride {{is widely}} used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It is {{more powerful than the}} related reagent sodium borohydride owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, <b>oxime,</b> and azide compounds into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces quaternary ammonium cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by alkoxy groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.|$|E
