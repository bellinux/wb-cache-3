40|$|The {{performance}} {{and integrity of}} optical fiber based devices and systems are often critically dependent on the optical coupling between interconnected fibers. In this paper, we discuss the optical characteristics of the interconnected joint when two dissimilar fibers are fusion-spliced together, and compare different approaches to estimate the optical coupling loss. We treat the total <b>optical</b> <b>splice</b> loss as {{a combination of the}} mode-field (MF) mismatch loss and the transition taper loss. We describe the spectral characteristics of mode-field mismatch loss and the taper loss between an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) and SMF 28 fiber both experimentally and analytically. In addition, we outline some advanced techniques for fusion-splicing of large mode area (LMA) fibers and microstructured fibers. Finally, we compare two types of splicers using arc-discharge fusion and filament fusion technologies, and describe an automated splicing system with some examples...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the research on}} optimization of the splicing process in the electric arc of telecommunication optical fibers and erbium doped EDF fibers. The results of the calculations of diffusion coefficients GeO 2 in telecommunication optical fibers and diffusion coefficients Er and Al 2 O 3 (together) in the fiber EDF are presented. Diffusion coefficients were determined for the fusion temperature in the electric arc ≈ 2000 ◦C, {{on the basis of}} changes, along the splice, of spliced thermoluminescence intensity profiles of the fibers. On the basis of knowledge of diffusion coefficients simulation calculation of loss joints of MC SMF fiber (Matched Cladding Single Mode Fiber – SiO 2 : GeO 2) and NZDS SMF (Non Zero Dispersion Shifted – Single Mode Fiber – SiO 2 : GeO 2) with EDF (Erbium Doped Fiber – SiO 2 : Al 2 O 3, Er) was performed and presented as a function of diffusion time. Experimental studies of optimization of thermal connected MC SMF and NZDS SMF with EDF were presented and compared with theoretical results. This paper {{presents the}} results of microscopic observations of defects and diffusion, and X-ray microanalysis in the spliced areas of single-mode telecommunication optical fibers: MC SMF, NZDS-SMF and erbium doped active single mode optical fibers.

25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes <b>optical</b> loss. A <b>splice</b> loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Bragg {{gratings}} {{written in}} polymer optical fibres {{are much more}} sensitive to temperature and strain measurements than silica fibre with a lower Young's modules and higher temperature coefficient. The good biocompatibility of polymer fibres makes them ideal medical sensors for in vivo strain and temperature measurements as well as excellent chemical sensors that can easily be doped with organic compounds. Most of the Bragg gratings in polymer optical fibres are inscribed around 1550 nm where the attenuation is as large as 1 dB/em. Grating fabrication was investigated at 980 nm where the attenuation was discovered to be optimal (less than 0. 1 dB/em). The polymer <b>optical</b> fibre was <b>spliced</b> to silica <b>optical</b> fibre through butt-coupling and affixed with optical adhesive to produce transmission loss of between 7 and 25 dB (at 980 nm). Preliminary results show {{that it may be}} possible to create fibre Bragg gratings in polymer optical fibre at 980 nm. Gratings inscribed in fibre with an energy density of between 80 and 150 mJ/cm 2 supplied by Paradigm Optics (MORFOP 3) had a repeatability of 25 %. With the fibres supplied by Prof. Peng (PBzMA- PEMA- PMMA co-polymer) a success rate of more than 90 % was achieved when using energy densities around 70 mJ/cm 2 • However, these gratings were weak and disappeared within 48 hours. The strength of these gratings varied from grating to grating. The reason of this instability is unknown and should be further investigated.

40|$|Nesse trabalho são descritas duas técnicas de pós-processamento em fibras de cristal fotônico (PCFs, do inglês Photonic Crystal Fibers) desenvolvidas para alterar suas propriedades de guiamento. A primeira {{consiste}} em fechar seletivamente buracos da microestrutura das PCF possibilitando assim, entre outras coisas, o preenchimento de alguns buracos com materiais como líquidos, polímeros e nanopartículas. A outra técnica consiste em se colapsar seletivamente buracos da seção transversal da microestrutura de uma PCF utilizando pressão diferencial e uma máquina de emendas para fibras ópticas, sendo baseada em técnicas previamente demonstradas para o afilamento (tapering) de PCFs. Com a utilização da primeira dessas técnicas é apresentada uma maneira simples e eficiente de se vedar fibras com núcleo líquido, evitando-se assim a evaporação. O estudo de PCFs com núcleos complexos, formados pelo núcleo original de uma fibra de núcleo sólido e um buraco adjacente ao núcleo preenchido por óleo foi também realizado com essa técnica, proporcionando uma grande interação da luz com o canal preenchido e uma alta sensibilidade a temperatura (deslocamento de 5, 35 nm/C nas estruturas espectrais observadas). Utilizado-se a segunda técnica, o colapso de um buraco adjacente ao núcleo sólido de uma PCF permitiu o desenvolvimento de um interferômetro modal de Mach-Zehnder totalmente a fibra, apresentando uma profundidade de modulação espectral de 9, 5 dB, semelhante à de outros interferômetros modais em PCFs reportados na literatura, e uma sensibilidade a temperatura de - 54 pm/C, cerca de 4 vezes maior do que a de redes de Bragg em fibras ópticas convencionais. A mesma técnica foi utilizada para se obter o acoplamento óptico entre 2 núcleos de uma fibra de cristal fotônico com 3 núcleos inicialmente desacoplados. In {{this work}} two techniques are described for post-processing photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), which {{were developed to}} change their guidance properties.

The study of PCFs with complex cores formed by the original core of a solid-core fiber and an oil-filled hole adjacent to the core was also undertaken with this technique and provided a strong interaction between light and the filled channel, as well as a high sensitivity to temperature (displacement of 5. 35 nm/C in the observed spectral structures). With the use of the second technique, the collapse of a hole adjacent to the solid core of a PCF allowed the development of a modal Mach-Zehnder allfiber interferometer, with a spectral modulation depth of 9. 5 dB, which {{is similar to that of}} other PCF modal interferometers reported in the literature, and a sensitivity to temperature of - 54 pm/C, which is about 4 times higher than that of Bragg gratings in conventional optical fibers.
