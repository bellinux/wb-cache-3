5|$|According to the {{earliest}} account, the first Elves are awakened by Eru Ilúvatar near {{the bay of}} Cuiviénen during the Years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees</b> in the First Age. They awake under the starlit sky, as the Sun and Moon {{have yet to be}} created. The first Elves to awake are three pairs: Imin ("First") and his wife Iminyë, Tata ("Second") and Tatië, and Enel ("Third") and Enelyë.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> especially in winter.|$|E
5000|$|Situations where <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> being {{measured}} {{is above}} eye level and <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> being measured is below eye level {{is the most}} common situation encountered in the field. The other two cases are those where both <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> are above eye level, and where both <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> are located below eye level. In the first situation, if D1 is the distance to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> as measured with a laser rangefinder, and (a) is the angle to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> measured with a clinometer, then this forms <b>the</b> hypotenuse <b>of</b> a right triangle with <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle at eye level. <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above eye level is = sin(a) x D1. The same process is used to measure the height or extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level where D1 is the distance to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and (b) is the angle to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> vertical distance to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level is = sin(b) x D2. Common sense should prevail when adding h1 and h2. If <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is below eye level the distance it extends below eye level is added to <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above eye level to calculate <b>the</b> total height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> If <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is above level then this height is subtracted from the height to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Mathematically since <b>the</b> sine <b>of</b> a negative angle is negative, we always get the following formula: ...|$|R
50|$|DBH is {{measured}} by holding the stick a fixed distance, usually 25 in, from the eye, and at breast height, which in the United States is 4.5 ft up <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stick is flush with <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> number where <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> lines up with the stick is <b>the</b> approximate DBH <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tree</b> {{height is}} <b>the</b> {{vertical}} distance between <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> highest sprig at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is measured for both height and girth {{as being the}} elevation at which <b>the</b> pith <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> intersects <b>the</b> ground surface beneath, or [...] "where the acorn sprouted." [...] On a slope this is considered as halfway between the ground level at {{the upper and lower}} sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Tree height can be measured {{in a number of ways}} with varying degrees of accuracy. There are direct measurements. Shorter trees can be measured using a long pole extended vertically to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Larger trees can be climbed and a tape measurement made from <b>the</b> highest point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climb to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> distance to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can be measured from that point, if needed, using a pole. Historically the most direct method of finding a tree's height was to cut it down and measure it prostrate on the ground.|$|R
5|$|Half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> in the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are northern hardwood trees. The remainder includes oak trees, {{which make}} up 29 percent of the watershed's trees, red maple (4 percent), aspen and gray birch (3 percent), Virginia pine, white pine, and hemlock (1 percent each).|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
50|$|The {{same process}} {{is used to}} measure <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level. If <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is below eye level, then <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> below eye level {{is added to the}} height above eye level. If <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is above eye level, then <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above eye level is {{subtracted}} from <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treetop above eye level. It may be difficult to directly measure the horizontal distance at eye level if that distance is high off the ground or if <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is above eye level. In these cases the distance to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can be measured using the tape along the slope from eye level to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and noting <b>the</b> slope angle Θ. In this case <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> above or below eye level is equal to the (sin Θ x slope distance) and the horizontal distance to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is (cos Θ x slope distance).|$|R

5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees,</b> but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E
5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to a still life pattern.|$|E
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tree</b> {{height is}} <b>the</b> {{vertical}} distance between <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest branch on <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> and {{is difficult to}} measure accurately.

If a <b>tree</b> is leaning, <b>the</b> trunk length may be greater than <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is where <b>the</b> projection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pith (center) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> intersects <b>the</b> existing supporting surface upon which <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is growing or where the acorn sprouted. If <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is growing on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> a cliff, <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is at <b>the</b> point where the pith would intersect the cliff side.

5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
5|$|The Shrine {{is set in}} a large {{expanse of}} parkland officially called Kings Domain. Over the years many other war {{memorials}} have been built in this area, including the Australian-Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and Crete in 1941, and statues of Monash and Blamey. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual Army units, naval vessels or Air Force squadrons, placed there by veterans' groups. An older memorial to Victorians killed in the Second Boer War of 1899–1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient Urartu, <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> Life [...] was a {{religious}} symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on <b>the</b> armor <b>of</b> warriors. <b>The</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> were equally {{divided on the}} right and left sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Servants stood on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> with one <b>of</b> their hands up as if they are taking care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cross-triangulation {{methods can}} be used. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is sighted from one {{position}} and the line along the ground from the viewer toward <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is marked. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is then located from a second viewing position, ideally about 90 degrees around <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> from <b>the</b> first location, and the line along the ground toward <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is again marked. <b>The</b> intersection <b>of</b> these two lines should be position on the ground directly underneath <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> Once this position is known <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treetop above this point can be measured using the tangent method {{without the need for}} a laser rangefinder.

5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double storied structure built with bricks, rising to the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> in the well tended garden called Anand Mahal. The garden is laid out with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E

5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
