25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in <b>our</b> <b>language,</b> must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, {{that there is no}} consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of language {{as an expression}} of culture, of who we are as a people, must be upheld by each individual, each family, each community, and each nation. As Fishman (1996) states, language is the mind, spirit, and soul of a people. Every effort must be made to protect, preserve, promote, and practice <b>our</b> Indigenous/Aboriginal <b>languages.</b> We must gather into the circle all the knowledge, wisdom, and energy we possess to ensure their survival. Over the last thirty years, various programs and projects have been initiated in an attempt to keep <b>our</b> <b>languages</b> alive. We must especially recognize and thank <b>our</b> Elders and <b>language</b> teachers for their perseverance in efforts to save <b>our</b> <b>languages</b> despite the lack of support given to them. As a world community of Indigenous people, we are faced with many common challenges in our attempts to maintain the vitality of <b>our</b> respective <b>languages</b> and to honour “the natural order of the Creator. ” But in the end, the preservation and use of <b>our</b> <b>languages</b> depends on <b>our</b> communities: “When the smallest of our communities hangs on to their language [...] [it] allows your communit...|$|R
40|$|Let M be a 2 -dimensional colored map {{which has}} been {{digitized}} into a large 2 -dimensional array (M). We define a class of languages (called rectilinear) to describe our digitized maps and classify them based on their level of succinct representation. We also study the map compression problem, i. e., the problem of finding for any given map a shortest description within a given language. For one dimensional maps we show that a shortest description can be generated quickly for some languages, but for other languages the problem is NP-hard. We also show {{that a large number}} of linear time algorithms for <b>our</b> <b>languages</b> generate map descriptions whose length is at most twice the length of the minimum length description. For all <b>our</b> <b>languages</b> we show that the two dimensional map compression problem is NP-hard.

25|$|Logic and the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study of how <b>our</b> <b>language</b> engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E
25|$|The Poles {{had already}} {{suffered}} from discrimination and numerous oppressive measures in Germany long before unification. These measures were intensified after the German Empire was formed and Bismarck {{was known to}} be particularly hostile towards the Poles. Christopher Clark argues that Prussian policy changed radically in the 1870s in the face of highly visible Polish support for France in the Franco-Prussian war. Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army — though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend our national interests and <b>our</b> <b>language</b> against such hostile actions. Therefore, in the Province of Posen the Kulturkampf took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The Celtic Congress and Celtic League are {{groups that}} {{advocate}} cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations {{in order to}} protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working {{in the interests of the}} Cornish language. Cornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place names, as well as in Cornish surnames, and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats. There are periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly An Gannas, An Gowsva, and An Garrick. BBC Radio Cornwall has a news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the Western Morning News have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as The Packet, The West Briton and The Cornishman have also been known to have Cornish features. The language has financial sponsorship from sources, including the Millennium Commission. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: Agan Tavas (<b>Our</b> <b>Language),</b> the Cornish sub-group of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, Gorsedh Kernow, Kesva an Taves Kernewek (the Cornish Language Board) and Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek (the Cornish Language Fellowship)].|$|E

500|$|Some critics find it {{difficult}} to accept Fodor's insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls [...] "lexical concepts" [...] (those for which <b>our</b> <b>language</b> has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.|$|E

Other dictionaries, such as Nathan Bailey's Dictionarium Britannicum, included more words, and in the 150 years preceding Johnson's dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual [...] "English" [...] dictionaries had been produced. However, there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period. In 1741, David Hume claimed: [...] "The Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us.

[...] Johnson's Dictionary offers insights into the 18th century and [...] "a faithful record of the language people used". It is more than a reference book; it is a work of literature.|$|E

500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, the Spanish Crown sent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican provisional battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders, depleting the Puerto Rican troops in the island. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, composed of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled the American forces in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican battalion suffered a total of 70 casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners. The Spanish appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Manuel Macías y Casado, declared martial law, resolving to resist the American forces. He declared: 'Providence will not permit that in these countries which were discovered by the Spanish nation the echo of <b>our</b> <b>language</b> should ever cease to be heard, nor that our flag should disappear before the eyes…. Long live Puerto Rico, always Spanish. Long live Spain." [...] Macías y Casado hoped that a grant of autonomy would ensure that Puerto Ricans would remain loyal to the Spanish crown.|$|E
500|$|Other {{curriculum}} topics chosen {{during the}} seminar included Arabic culture and heritage, school readiness, health and wellness, and female education. The seminar participants {{decided to use}} MSA, like the producers had done for the original show, citing an even greater need to expose children to the Arabic language. The National, for example, stated, [...] " [...] At a time when Arab children are increasingly deviating from their language and culture because of programming from nations like the United States and India, initiatives like this will help to reverse the trend". Abdulla Al Sharhan, the new show's creative director, agreed: [...] "We are losing <b>our</b> <b>language,</b> and so through Iftah Ya Simsim, we can revive the language {{in such a way}} that a child learns proper Arabic in a fun way". As with the original, outreach was an important part of the new show. Even before the show aired, four characters from the original toured the region, educating young children and their families about road and car safety. The cast and crew took a break from filming for a few months for [...] "constant live events" [...] to interact with their young viewers. Books, DVDs, CDs, online material and outreach programs for children, parents, and teachers were produced.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, Edmund Gosse {{analyzed}} {{the reception of}} Gray's poem: [...] "It is curious to reflect upon the modest and careless mode in which that poem was first circulated which was destined to enjoy and to retain a higher reputation in literature than any other English poem perhaps than any other poem of the world written between Milton and Wordsworth." [...] He continued by stressing the poem's wide acceptance: [...] "The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe, from Denmark to Italy, from France to Russia. With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare, no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and {{after more than a}} century of existence we find it as fresh as ever, when its copies, even the most popular of all those of Lamartine, are faded and tarnished." [...] He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: [...] "It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity, of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear, of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation, and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master. The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse, our poem of poems; not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in <b>our</b> <b>language,</b> but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities that go to the production of a fine poetical effect." ...|$|E

500|$|The fictional {{character}} Stingaree {{proved to}} be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series [...] "In the Chains of Crime" [...] was published in June that year, titled [...] "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders [...] "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" [...] (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: [...] "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that [...] "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in <b>our</b> <b>language</b> than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that [...] "stern moralists" [...] would consider the book's premise [...] "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer [...] "expressing [...] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue." ...|$|E
