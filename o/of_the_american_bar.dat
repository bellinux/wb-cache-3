5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Bar</b> Association (ABA), {{called attention}} to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Stevenson {{defeated}} incumbent Thomas C. McCreery for {{his seat}} in the U.S. Senate after criticizing McCreery for allegedly supporting the appointment of Stephen G. Burbridge, who was hated by most Kentuckians, to a federal position. In the Senate, he opposed internal improvements and defended a constructionist view of the constitution, resisting efforts to expand the powers expressly granted in that document. Beginning in late 1873, Stephenson functioned as the first chairman (later called floor leader) of the Senate Democratic caucus. He did not seek reelection in 1877, returning to his law practice and accepting future Kentucky Governor William Goebel as a law partner. He chaired the 1880 Democratic National Convention and was elected president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Bar</b> Association in 1884. He died in Covington on August 10, 1886, and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery at Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E

25|$|For the {{two years}} {{following}} his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father's office. In 1863 he {{was admitted to the}} bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of his state and his four years as governor, coming {{as they did in the}} latter part of his life, may have had a tendency to obscure for his later contemporaries the fact that he was at least as much as anything else an eminently successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer's work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book The Young Man and the Law revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Bar</b> Association and served as President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Bar</b> Association from 1890-1891. For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Bar</b> Association's Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its Annual Bulletins editor for general jurisprudence).|$|E

25|$|The NAACP took on {{the task}} of {{organizing}} the defendants' appeals.

Murphy, a 79-year-old Confederate veteran and former Attorney General for the State of Arkansas.
