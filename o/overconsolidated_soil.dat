40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical criterion for brittle failure {{of rocks and}} heavily <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils.</b> Griffith’s model of a randomly oriented defect under a biaxial stress state is used to keep the criterion simple. The Griffith’s criterion is improved because the maximum tensile strength is not evaluated at the boundary of the defect but at a certain distance from the boundary, known as the critical distance. This fracture criterion {{is known as the}} Point Method, and is part of the Theory of Critical Distances, which is utilized in fracture mechanics. The proposed failure criterion has two parameters: the inherent tensile strength, ó 0, and the ratio of the half-length of the initial crack/flaw to the critical distance, a/L. These parameters are difficult to measure but they may be correlated with the uniaxial compressive and tensile strengths, óc and ót. The proposed criterion is able to reproduce the common range of strength ratios for rocks and heavily <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils</b> (óc/ót= 3 - 50) and the influence of several microstructural rock properties, such as texture and porosity. Good agreement with laboratory tests reported in the literature is found for tensile and low confining stresses.

40|$|To {{counteract}} {{natural hazards}} such as landslides, current methods {{for evaluation of}} soil properties as a mean for determining the safety level of natural slopes need to be refined. The empirical relationships used for estimation of the undrained shear strength from piezocone and field vane test {{are based on the}} stress conditions valid for horizontal ground and normally consolidated or slightly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil.</b> Limited studies indicate that the different relations between vertical and horizontal stresses that exist in a slope and for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil</b> have a large influence on these results. The aim of the present study is to document the influence of horizontal stresses on the undrained shear strength, evaluated using piezocone and field vane tests and, if necessary, modify the evaluation accordingly. Model tests with a mini vane and mini piezocone in large triaxial cells were conducted in order to study the effects of the ratio between horizontal and vertical stresses on the undrained shear strength as determined using piezocone and vane tests under controlled conditions. The results were compared with results from direct simple shear tests. The aim was to simulate the stress conditions in the active and the passive zones of a slope as well as for horizontal ground surface. The results from the analysis of the data from the vane model tests indicate that the horizontal preconsolidation pressure and the OCR in the horizontal direction have a major influence on the vane shear strength. Together with empirical data from earlier studies, also the results from the piezocone model tests indicate that the net cone resistance is primarily dependent on the horizontal preconsolidation pressure. Field tests were carried out at two test sites consisting of homogeneous clay and with slopes eroded from originally horizontal ground. The undrained shear strength at the test sites were estimated from piezocone tests, field vane tests and direct simple shear tests. The undrained shear strength from the field vane tests and the piezocone tests at the toe of the test site slopes were also predicted {{based on the results of}} the model tests and the stress conditions in the slopes. The undrained shear strength evaluated from the adapted model test results for the field vane test corresponds quite well with the empirical relationship that includes a correction for OCR, for both test sites.

40|$|Tolerable {{mobility}} of subsea foundations and pipelines supporting offshore {{oil and gas}} developments has recently become an accepted design concept. It enables a smaller foundation footprint and so is a potential cost-saving alternative to conventionally engineered ‘fixed’ seabed foundations. Dominant sources of loading on subsea infrastructure arise from connection misalignment or thermal and pressure-induced expansion, and these are reduced if the structure is permitted to displace while ensuring that additional loading is not induced by excessive settlements. A sound prediction of the resulting sliding response will provide a robust design basis for mobile subsea infrastructure. This paper presents a theoretical model based on critical state soil mechanics to predict {{the performance of a}} subsea installation that is founded on soft, normally consolidated or lightly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil,</b> and subjected to intermittent horizontal sliding movements. The framework is validated against centrifuge test results and is shown to capture the essential elements of the soil–structure interaction, which include: (a) the changing soil strength from cycles of sliding and pore pressure generation; (b) the regain in strength due to dissipation of excess pore pressure (consolidation); and (c) the soil contraction and consequent settlement of the foundation caused by the consolidation process. </p...|$|E

Shanghai Clay is a lightly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil</b> (OCR= 1. 2 - 1. 3) with true cohesion or bonding. Due {{to the influence of}} soil structures, the secondary compression index C (alpha) varies significantly with consolidation stress and the maximum value of C (alpha) occurs in the vicinity of preconsolidation stress. Measured coefficients of secondary compression generally fall in the range of 0. 2 %- 0. 8 % based on which Shanghai Clay can be classified as a soil with low to medium secondary compressibility. The effect of soil structures on the compressibility of Shanghai Clay is found to reduce with an increase in depth. Soil structure has an important influence on initial soil stiffness, but does not appear to affect undrained shear strength significantly.

The main {{aim of the research}} is to define a failure criteria for cohesive soils subjected to this type of load.

Analysis of the results includes the influence of number of load cycles on the course of effective stress paths, development of excess pore water pressure and stress deviator value. Observed regularities may seem surprising. The effective stress path initially moves away from the boundary surface and only after a certain number of load-unload cycles change of its direction occurs and it starts to move consequently towards the surface. At the same time, it has been observed that pore water pressure value decreases at the beginning and after few hundred cycles increases again. It is a typical behaviour for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil,</b> while test samples are normally consolidated.

40|$|Studying the wetting-induced {{softening}} {{behavior of}} unsaturated soils {{is important for}} understanding rain-induced slope failures in unsaturated soils. However, experimental studies on expansive soils are limited. This study investigates the wetting-induced softening characteristics of an unsaturated expansive clay via suction-controlled triaxial tests on recompacted and natural specimens. It {{was found that the}} wetting-induced swelling of the soil included a significant component of plastic strain and its magnitude decreased with the net confining stress. When a soil specimen was subjected to wetting at a constant deviator stress, a threshold value of soil suction was identified after which the axial strain increased greatly. This value tended to increase with the applied net stress ratio. After the threshold suction, the wetting process for recompacted specimens could be divided into a yielding process associated with volumetric strain hardening/softening and a failure process in which the volumetric behavior depended on the applied net stress ratio. The natural specimens exhibited a brittle failure like a heavily <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil</b> during wetting at a constant deviator stress and continuous volumetric dilation occurred after the threshold suction.

40|$|Repeated {{undrained}} load {{tests were}} carried out under the application of cyclic deviator stresses at a frequency that varies from 0. 0001 Hz up to 0. 001 Hz. For a specific amplitude of applied stress, a critical level of repeated loading (CLRL) was evaluated for both kaolinite and crust clays. The strength of the soil {{is affected by the}} frequency, cyclic fluctuation of water table, and the amount of axial strain developed during cycling. The decrease in postcyclic strength is strain-dependent. It is further shown that cycling below the CLRL causes an increase in the overconsolidation of the clayey soils. The effect of cycling in behaviour of soils increases with increasing the OCR. This thesis also describes a method for the determination of in situ horizontal stresses of heavily overconsolidated sands using a stress-path triaxial apparatus. This method was proposed by Garga and Khan (1991) who applied it for overconsolidated clays. The proposed method is based on the concept that if the radial stress exceeds the in situ horizontal stress, while maintaining the axial stress constant and equal to the in situ vertical effective stress, only then will the sample experience significant axial strain. In this investigation, the above method is applied to the samples of known stress histories of overconsolidated sand. The effect of the complex stress history undergone by soils on the estimation of K 0 by the proposed method is investigated in laboratory. It is found that the proposed method replicated the imposed "in situ" horizontal stress exactly. Also this method is capable of estimating K 0 of an <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil</b> irrespective of the previously imposed stress history. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

This thesis investigates the mechanical behavior heavily overconsolidated Resedimented Boston Blue Clay (RBBC), as an analog test material. The uniformity, reproducibility, and extensive knowledgebase on this clay permit the investigation of only the effect of overconsolidation. A series of undrained triaxial compression shear tests have been performed on specimens that were Ko-consolidated and swelled to overconsolidation ratios (OCR) ranging from 5 to 62 on RBBC, as well as on Intact Presumpscot Maine Clay. Specimens were consolidated to maximum stress levels between 1. 1 and 5. 4 MPa. The undrained shear behavior revealed an important relationship with overconsolidation ratio. The triaxial compression test results exhibit {{a significant increase in the}} undrained strength ratio (su/[sigma]'vc) when normalized to the minimum consolidation stress. It also shows an important increase in the stiffness, increase in the strain ([epsilon]f) to mobilize the peak resistance and a significant increase of friction angle ([phi]') with overconsolidation. The applicability of the SHANSEP equation and impact on its equation parameters are also discussed in detail. A comprehensive comparison of the new results with prior normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated data is presented, showing the distinct behavior of heavily overconsolidated specimens. The failure envelope displays a non-linear behavior and the undrained shear strength (su) is reduced up to about 80 % from a normally consolidated clay to a heavily overconsolidated clay with an OCR = 50.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the strength-deformation behaviour of a weathered clay crust in the Ottawa region. This study includes an extensive experimental programme, covering both field and laboratory tests. The field testing methods used were the field vane, the dilatometer, the piezocone, and the self-boring pressuremeter. Triaxial shear and consolidation tests were conducted in the laboratory testing programme. Conventional triaxial tests, in both compression and extension, and non-conventional stress-path tests covering various stress-paths in the triaxial space, were performed in this study. Constant rate of strain, constant rate of load, controlled gradient, as well as the conventional oedometer tests were conducted in the consolidation testing programme. In order to perform the laboratory experiments, a computer-operated triaxial stress-path control system and an automated consolidation apparatus were developed. The software for the automation of the above apparatus was also developed in this research. A laboratory method for the evaluation of in situ K 0 for highly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil</b> has been proposed. Such a method is necessary for the stress-path triaxial tests, where reconsolidation of the triaxial sample to in situ state of stress is required. A new method of interpretation of field vane (FV) test, for anisotropic soil, has also been developed. In this method, the original equation for the interpretation of FV has been reformulated which includes the strength anisotropy of the soil, non-uniform stress distribution around the FV, effect of rate of shearing and the disturbance due to vane insertion. From the analysis of the laboratory triaxial and consolidation tests, for various depths within the crust, a well defined yield envelope was obtained. This yield envelope can be used to estimate the elastic and plastic strains for any stress-path in the field.

40|$|After the {{excavation}} of a cut slope ongoing deformations {{on the slope}} surface can often be measured. These deformations can be induced due to various processes and {{can also be used}} as an indicator of slope stability. If the reasons for the deformations are known, selective stabilization methods can help to decelerate, or stop, the movements. The potential for the recognition of displacement patterns in excavated slopes is studied in this dissertation. In the laboratory, the analysis of displacement patterns due to various processes is difficult as identical initial test conditions can hardly be reproduced. Furthermore, measurements of displacements can only be conducted to a limited degree. Therefore, numerical calculations using the finite element method were applied to simulate excavation processes and analyse the displacements. In addition, a suitable mathematical model has to be used to represent the stress-strain behaviour during the unloading process. Three different advanced constitutive soil models were chosen to calculate an excavation process of an idealized slope assuming drained conditions: - elasto-plastic Modified-Cam-Clay model - rate-independent hypoplastic model according to Masin - rate-dependent visco-hypoplastic model according to Niemunis Before conducting {{the excavation}} simulation, the soil parameters of the constitutive models were calibrated by means of numerical element tests, depicting the stress paths of conventional laboratory tests. Within the literature, those conventional laboratory tests are recommended for the determination of parameters for the constitutive models. A parameter set for the visco-hypoplastic model was chosen from literature. The parameters were adapted for the remaining models. Thus, all three models predicted approximately the same stress-strain behaviour during conventional laboratory tests. Despite the correlations during the element tests, the constitutive models predicted different displacements during the calculation of the excavation of an idealized slope under drained conditions. Thereupon, load-controlled triaxial compression tests were conducted reproducing the characteristic stress paths during an excavation process. At the same time, numerical calculations were carried out to reproduce the triaxial compression tests, and the measured and calculated displacement behaviour was compared. Different processes such as pure unloading due to excavation, excavation in <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil,</b> excavation coupled with consolidation, excavation coupled with previous ground water lowering and consolidation as well as the influence of creep effects were considered in the analysis of the displacement patterns during an excavation. It can be stated that the evaluation of displacements and changes in displacements in a single point on the slope surface cannot provide sufficient information about a certain physical process. Only the combination of displacement paths at different survey points will lead to a reliable conclusion. Thus, representative displacement patterns for different processes are recognizable during and after the excavation, which can be used for the identification. During the numerical simulation of an in-situ model test, where a slope was brought to failure by excavation, the calculated displacements were analysed for identifiable displacement patterns. It can be stated that despite different slope systems, consistencies were found within characteristic survey points. These points can be used to identify patterns within the displacement contours...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} soils may {{be generated}} from open-pit mining: lumpy soils with a granular structure and clay mixtures, {{depending on the}} length of the conveyor belt and the strength of the original soils. Lumpy soils may be created for a high strength of the excavated soils. They are dumped as landfills without any compaction, which permits the water and air flows via the inter-lump voids. As a result, a new structure consisting of the lumps and reconstituted soil within the inter-lump voids can be created. However, if the original soil has a low strength or a long transportation takes place, the material may disintegrate into small lumps and thoroughly mix soils from different layers. Landfills consisting of clay mixtures arise in this way. The stability and deformation of landfills are crucial for design of occupied area and landfill slopes. For this reason, three different landfill materials will be investigated in this thesis: (1) the lumpy granular soil from fresh landfills, (2) the lumpy composite soil corresponding to old landfills and (3) clay mixtures. Firstly, an artificial lumpy soil was investigated. It is a transition form between the reconstituted and natural lumpy soils. Compression, permeability and strength of lumpy materials have been evaluated based on oedometer and triaxial tests. The shear strength of the normally consolidated lumpy specimens lies approximately on the Critical State Line of the reconstituted soil. The reconstituted soil, which exists in the inter-lump voids, plays {{a crucial role in the}} behaviour of artificial lumpy materials. Similarly to the artificial lumpy soil, inter-lump voids of the natural lumpy soil are mainly closed above a relatively small stress level, which is induced by the rearrangement of the lumps. However, its limit stress state is located above the Critical State Line of the reconstituted soil, which may be caused by the diagenetic soil structure in the natural lumps. The structure transition of the lumpy granular material can be divided into three possible stages related to the stress level. Firstly, the compressibility of a fresh lumpy is relativity high due to the closure of the inter-lump voids within a low stress range. In this stage, the hydraulic conductivity is mainly controlled by the inter-lump skeleton due to the existence of macro drainage paths, while the shear strength is controlled by the reconstituted soil around the lumps. Afterwards, its compressibility decreases with the consolidation stress and the soil behaves similarly to an <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soil.</b> The clayfill appears to be uniform visually in this stage, but its structure is still highly heterogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity is higher than that of the reconstituted soil with the same overall specific volume. Finally, the loading reaches the preconsolidation stress of the lumps, and the whole soil volume becomes normally consolidated. Isotropically consolidated drained triaxial shear tests were performed on artificially prepared specimens with parallel and series structures. The laboratory tests show that the specimens with the series structure have the same failure mode as the constituent with the lower strength; the specimens with the parallel structure have a failure plane which crosses both constituents. As a result, the shear strength of the series specimens is only slightly higher than that of the constituent with the lower strength and the strength of the parallel specimens lies between those of the constituents. Afterwards, the behaviour of an artificial lumpy material with randomly distributed inclusions is investigated using the Finite Element Method. The computation results show that the stress ratio, defined as the ratio of the volume-average stress between the lumps and the reconstituted soil within the inter-lump voids, is significantly affected by both the volume fraction and the preconsolidation pressure of the lumps under an isotropic compression path, while the volume fraction of the lumps plays a minor role under a triaxial compression path. Based on the simulation results and analysis of the two basic configurations, a homogenization law was proposed utilizing the secant stiffnesses. The compression behavior of the lumpy composite soil was analyzed within the homogenization framework. Firstly, the volume of the composite soil was divided into four individual components. The inter-lump porosity was introduced to account for the evolution of the volume fractions of the constituents, and it was formulated as a function of the overall porosity and those of its constituents. A homogenization law was then proposed based on the analysis of the lumpy structure together with a numerical method, which gives a relationship for tangent stiffnesses of the lumpy soil and its constituents. Finally, a simple compression model was proposed for the composite lumpy material, which incorporates both the influence of the soil structure and the volume fraction change of the reconstituted soil. Furthermore, a general framework for the consolidation behaviour of the lumpy composite soil was proposed based on the double porosity concept and the homogenization theory. To describe the behaviour of lumps with low stress level, a new failure line was proposed with help of the equivalent Hvorslev pressure and critical state concept. The structure effect was incorporated into the nonlinear Hvorslev surface within sensitivity framework and the generalized Cam clay model proposed by McDowell and Hau (2003) was adopted on the wet side of the critical state. A secant stiffness, defined as the ratio between the deviatoric stress and deviatoric strain, was used in the homogenization law. Finally, a simple model for the natural lumpy soil was proposed within the homogenization framework. The physical properties, compression behaviour and remolded undrained shear strength of clay mixtures were investigated by reproducing the soils artificially in the lab. Afterwards, the models for the compression and undrained shear strength of clay mixtures were proposed. The model for the strength of the clay mixture originated from simplifying the structure of a clay mixture, in which the elements of the constituents are randomly distributed in a representative elementary volume. By defining a water content ratio (the ratio of water contents between the constituents), the undrained shear strength of each constituent was estimated separately and then combined together with corresponding volume fractions. A homogenization law was proposed afterwards based on the analysis of the randomly arranged structure. A simple compression model considering $N$ constituents was proposed within the homogenization framework, which was evaluated by a mixture with two constituents.

Klumpige Böden entstehen bei der Abbaggerung des natürlichen Materials auf der Abbauseite, welches eine hohe Festigkeit besitzt. Alle Böden werden normalerweise ohne Verdichtung verkippt, so entstehen bei der Verkippung von klumpigen Böden grosse Makro-Porenräume zwischen den Klumpen, welche sehr luft- bzw. wasserdurchlässig sind. Nach einiger Zeit entsteht eine neue Struktur aus den Klumpen und dem Material des sich von aussen auflösenden Klumpens, welches das Füllmaterial bildet. Wenn die Festigkeit des Ausgangsmaterials niedrig ist oder lange Transportwege stattfinden, zerfallen die Klumpen. Zudem werden die Böden von verschiedenen Schichten der Abbauseite unter einander gemischt, wodurch die Tongemische entstehen. Sowohl für die Dimensionierung und Berechnung der aus den Verkippungen entstehenden Tagebaurandböschungen sowie für eine spätere Nutzung des ehemaligen Tagebaugebietes ist die Kenntnisüber das Deformations- und Verformungsverhalten von Kippenböden notwendig. Daher wurden in dieser Arbeit Tagebauböden und ihr zeitlich veränderliches Verhalten untersucht. Dabei werden diese, bezugnehmend auf den Anfangszustand, in drei typische Materialien unterschieden: (1) der frisch verkippte klumpige Boden, (2) eine Mischung aus Klumpen und Füllmaterial, welche höhere Liegezeiten repräsentiert und (3) Mischungen von feinkörnigen Ausgangsböden. Zunächst wurden künstlich hergestellte klumpige Böden untersucht. Sie bilden eine Übergangsform zwischen aufbereiteten und natürlichen klumpigen Böden. Das Kompressions- und Scherverhalten sowie die Durchlässigkeit wurden an Ödometer und Triaxialversuchen bestimmt. Das Füllmaterial, welches die Makroporen zwischen den Klumpen füllt, spielt eine entscheidende Rolle für das Materialverhalten. Ähnlich wie bei den künstlich hergestellten klumpigen Böden schliessen sich auch bei den Böden im Tagebau die Makroporenschen bei niedrigen Spannungen. Dabei werden die Klumpen umgelagert. Allerdings befindet sich die Grenze des Spannungszustandes oberhalb der Critical State Line des Füllmaterials, was möglicherweise mit den unter Diagenese entstandenen Bodenstrukturen erklärt werden kann. Die Strukturänderung der klumpigen Böden kann aufgrund des Spannungsniveaus in drei mögliche Stufen unterteilt werden. Am Anfang ist die Kompressibilität der frischen verkippten Klumpen hoch, da sich die Makroporen bereits bei geringen Spannungen schliessen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt sind auch die Durchlässigkeiten in erster Linie von den grossen Porenräumen der Makroporen, welche als Entwässerungspfade dienen, beeinflusst. Die Scherfestigkeit hingegen, wird durch die aufgeweichten Böden an den Oberflächen der Klumpen massgebend beeinflusst. Bei höheren Konsolidationspannungen sinkt die Kompressibilität und der Boden verhält sich wie einüberkonsolidierter Boden. Obwohl die Struktur aufgrund der veränderten Klumpenoberflächen zu diesem Zeitpunkt homogener wirkt, ist die Struktur noch heterogen und die Durchlässigkeit ist höher als bei einem aufbereiteten Boden mit gleichem spezifischem Volumen (Porenzahl). Letztendlich erreicht der aktuelle Spannungszustand den derüberkonsolidierten Klumpen und der gesamte Boden verhält sich wie ein normal konsolidierter Boden. Des Weiteren wurden isotrop konsolidierte drainierte Triaxialversuche an künstlich aus zwei Ausgangsmaterialien hergestellten Proben mit parallelen und seriellen Strukturen durchgeführt. Die Laborversuche zeigten, dass die Proben mit seriellem Aufbau dieselben Gleitflächen haben, wie der Ausgangsboden mit der niedrigeren Scherfestigkeit. Die Gleitfläche der Proben mit parallelen Strukturen verlief durch beide Materialien. Es wurde festgestellt, dass die Scherfestigkeit der seriell aufgebauten Proben geringfügig höher, als die des Bodens mit der niedrigeren Scherfestigkeit ist. Die Scherfestigkeit der parallel aufgebauten Proben liegt zwischen den beiden Ausgangsmaterialien. Danach wurde das Verhalten der künstlich erzeugten klumpigen Böden mit zufällig verteiltem Füllmaterial mit Hilfe der Finiten Elemente Methode verglichen. Die Simulationen zeigten, dass unter einer isotropen Kompressionsbelastung das Spannungsverhältnis, definiert aus dem Verhältnis der Spannung des Volumendurchschnitts zwischen den Klumpen und dem Füllmaterial, deutlich durch die Volumenanteile und die Vorkonsoliderungsspannung der Klumpen beeinflusst wird. Während das Volumenverhältnis eine untergeordnete Rolle in den in Triaxialzellen unter Scherung belasteten Proben spielt. Aus den Simulationsergebnissen und den Laborversuchen der beiden Grundkonfigurationen wurde ein Homogenisierungsgesetz abgeleitet, welches die Sekandensteifigkeiten verwendet. Das Kompressionsverhalten der Mischungen aus Klumpen und Füllmaterial wurde mit Blick auf die Homogenisierung analysiert. Zunächst kann das Volumen der Mischungen in 4 individuelle Komponentenanteile zerlegt werden. Die Makroporosität zwischen den Klumpen wurde zur Entwicklung der Volumenanteile des Füllmaterials eingeführt. Sie wurde als eine Funktion der totalen Porosität und der Materialien formuliert. Auf Grundlage einer theoretischen Analyse an klumpigen Böden und unter Zuhilfenahme einer numerischen Methode wird ein Gesetz zur Homogenisierung vorgeschlagen. Dieses enthält eine Beziehung zwischen der Tagentensteifigkeit der Klumpen und seinem Füllmaterial. Abschliessend wird ein einfaches Kompressionsmodel für die Mischung aus Klumpen und Füllmaterial vorgeschlagen, welches den Einfluss der Bodenstruktur und der Änderung des Volumenanteils des Füllmaterials berücksichtigt. Darüber hinaus wurde eine allgemeine Formulierung für das Konsolidationsverhalten der klumpigen Böden mit Füllmaterial vorgeschlagen, welche sich auf das Konzept der doppelten Porosität (Klumpen und Füllmaterial) und eine Homogenisierungstheoerie bezieht. Um das Verhalten der Klumpen bei niedrigen Spannungen zu beschreiben, wird eine neue Grenzbedingung unter Zuhilfenahme der äquivalenten Hvorslev-Spannung und des Criticial State Konzeptes vorgeschlagen. Der Struktureffekt für sensitive Böden wurde in die nichtlineare Hvorslev-Oberfläche eingebaut. Das allgemein gültige Cam-Clay-Model von McDowell und Hau (2003) wurde um die nasse Seite des Critical State Konzeptes erweitert. Eine Sekandensteifigkeit, definiert aus dem Verhältnis zwischen der Deviatorspannung und der Deviatordehnung, wurde für das Homogenisieurungsgesetz ebenfalls verwendet. Abschliessend wird ein Modell für natürliche klumpige Böden vorgestellt, welches auch eine Homogenisierung beinhaltet. Die physikalischen Eigenschaften, das Kompressionsverhalten und die undrainierten Scherfestigkeiten von aufbereiten Tongemischen wurden im Labor unter Herstellung künstlicher Bödengemische untersucht. Anschliessend wurde ein Kompressions- und Schermodell für aufbereitete Tongemische vorgeschlagen. Das Modell der Scherfestigkeit der Tongemische entstand aus der Vereinfachung der Tongemischstruktur, in welcher die Elemente der Ausgangsmaterialien zufällig in dem Einheitsvolumen verteilt sind. Werden Wassergehaltsverhältnisse (das Verhältnis der Wassergehalte der Ausgangsmaterialien) definiert, kann die undrainierte Scherfestigkeit für alle Bestandteile separat geschätzt werden und dannüber die Volumenanteile bestimmt werden. Ein Homogenisierungsgesetz wurde auf Grundlage der theoretischen Analyse von zufällig angeordneten Strukturen entwickelt. Ein einfaches Kompressionsmodell, welches N-Ausgangsmaterielien bzw. Tone und eine Homogenisierung enthält, wird vorgeschlagen, und an einer Mischung aus 2 Bestandteilen im Labor validiert...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{constitutive}} models {{developed for}} saturated soils are inadequate when analysing problems involving unsaturated conditions. Although unsaturated constitutive models {{are available in}} the Imperial College Finite Element Program (ICFEP), there are aspects of unsaturated soil response that are not adequately simulated. The aim of the present thesis is to develop and implement numerical expressions describing the most relevant of these features and to apply them in combination with the existing ICFEP capabilities to boundary value problems involving unsaturated soils. The over-prediction of the peak shear stress exhibited by <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils</b> and the simplicity of the soil-water retention relationship employed, constitute the focal points of the improvements suggested. A new surface is introduced to substitute for the yield and plastic potential functions on the dry side of critical state, in order to prevent the available constitutive models from overestimating the peak deviatoric stress. The development, implementation and calibration of this surface are presented, followed by analyses of laboratory experiments demonstrating the improved simulation of soil behaviour. Novel formulations are proposed for the soil-water retention curve, which defines the relationship between the degree of saturation or the water content and the applied suction, modelling its hysteretic nature and incorporating the effect of specific volume. Ultimately, a three-dimensional hysteretic surface, defined in terms of degree of saturation, suction and specific volume, is presented. The new developments are subsequently applied to the numerical analysis of boundary value problems involving (a) the stability of slopes in <b>overconsolidated</b> unsaturated <b>soils</b> and (b) the behaviour of unsaturated soil slopes under seasonal changes of suction, highlighting the importance of adopting appropriate constitutive models.

40|$|The Modified Cam Clay (MCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used soil models, which is very popular in the world. It was developed by the researchers at the University of Cambridge, U. K. This MCC model has gained general acceptance amongst the researchers in the field of geotechnical engineering. Some commercial softwares for geotechnical problems are using the MCC model as the basis of analysis. The MCC model undoubtedly works very well for predicting the mechanical behavior of normally consolidated clay, but in reality some soils are in the state of overconsolidated. This study is aimed to find out some pitfalls in using the MCC model in relation to its application on <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils.</b> Some data from plane strain testing on the overconsolidated clay were used to examine the application of MCC model on overconsolidated clay. The results showed that, the MCC model is no longer able to simulate the mechanical behavior of heavily overconsolidated clay; the MCC calculation for heavily overconsolidated clay was deviated far below the experimental result.

40|$|The {{influence}} of previous stress history and stress path direction {{on the surface}} settlement trough induced by tunnelling A. GRAMMATIKOPOULOU*, L. ZDRAVKOVIC † and D. M. POTTS† The pre-failure behaviour of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils</b> is well known to be non-linear and inelastic. Over {{the last two decades}} experimental work has shown that pre-failure behaviour is also dependent on the previous stress history of the soil. However, some research has also suggested that, if enough time is allowed for creep to take place, then there is no effect of recent stress history; moreover, what affects soil stiffness is the direction of the stress path relative to the gross yield surface. This paper investigates the effect of two scenarios on the surface settlement trough associated with tunnelling. The first assumes that the previous stress history of the soil has an effect on soil stiffness, whereas the second assumes that creep/ageing periods have erased any memory of the previous stress history, and it is only the stress path direction that influences soil stiffness. A three-surface kinematic hardening model, which can simulate both scenarios, is employed in finite element analyses of tunnel construction. The predictions of the kinematic hardening model for the simulation of each scenario are compared with predictions using a non-linear elastic model and with field measurements...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} numerical simulations {{investigating the}} settlement reduction caused by stone columns {{in a natural}} soft clay. The {{focus is on the}} influence of the soft soil alteration caused by column installation. A uniform mesh of end-bearing columns under a distributed load was considered. Therefore, the columns were modelled using the "unit cell" concept, i. e. only one column and the corresponding surrounding soil in axial symmetry. The properties of the soft clay correspond to Bothkennar clay, which is modelled using S-CLAY 1 and S-CLAY 1 S, which are Cam clay type models that account for anisotropy and destructuration. The Modified Cam clay model is also used for comparison. Column installation was modelled independently to avoid mesh distortions, and soft soil alteration was directly considered in the initial input values. The results show that the changes in the stress field, such as the increase of radial stresses and mean stresses and the loss of overconsolidation, are beneficial for high loads and closely spaced columns but, on the contrary, may be negative for low loads, widely spaced columns and <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils.</b> Moreover, whilst the rotation of the soil fabric reduces the settlement, in contrast the soil destructuration during column installation reduces the improvement...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The object of this research programme {{was to investigate the}} stability of a silty clay under undrained repeated loading. Equipment has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading. This model can be used to predict pore pressures and failure for normally consolidated and lightly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{small-scale}} {{physical modelling}} system {{was developed and}} employed to investigate the effects of tube sampling. Amorphous silica and an oil blend of matching refractive index were mixed to form a transparent soil. Black glass beads were embedded within the soil body on the vertical central plane. After consolidation in a Perspex box, a glass model sampler was pushed into the transparent soil. Movements within the soil body were recorded using digital photography; these images were later analysed by Particle Image Velocimetry. The centreline strain path (CSP) of the sample during tube penetration was calculated and compared to existing analytical and numerical models’ strain predictions, and some degree of correlation was observed. However, it is shown that the CSP is not constant throughout the sample, but varies with depth below {{the base of the}} borehole. It was also noticed that after tube penetration, significant residual extensive strains remain for soil on the centreline of the specimen. Different tube geometries were tested and a correlation was found between strain magnitudes and the Area Ratio, Inside Clearance Ratio and the Outer Cutting Edge Taper Angle. It was also found that samples taken in normally consolidated soils were more heavily disturbed than those in lightly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils.</b> After removal from the soil model, samples were stored for six months and volumetric strains within them, set up by a redistribution of pore fluid pressures, were found to be small, typically less than 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{compacted}} coarse-grained materials, {{the stress}} state is largely {{influenced by the}} compaction procedure and by {{the characteristics of the}} single grains (mineralogy, shape). In this work, two compacted sandy gravels with the same grading but different grain properties have been tested in a large soft oedometer to highlight this influence. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the effect of oedometric ring deformability on the stress state is quantified in the framework of elastoplasticity. It is then shown that, for the adopted apparatus and for the tests carried out, the error in the measurement of the coefficient of earth pressure at rest K 0 caused by ring deformability is very small. The two tested materials, compacted by wet tamping, behave differently because of their different grain properties, showing, respectively, small and large grain breakage. In primary loading, the more crushable material has values of K 0 that compare well with Jaky’s (J Soc Hungarian Archit Eng 355 – 358, 1944) equation at any stress level and for every tested soil density. For the material with stronger grains, only very loose specimens that have undergone little or no compaction have a similar behaviour, while the denser specimens show the typical behaviour of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>soils,</b> with values of K 0 initially larger than that suggested by Jaky (J Soc Hungarian Archit Eng 355 – 358, 1944) for normally consolidated soils, tending to it only at the largest applied stress values.

In areas along the urban Wasatch Front in Utah, soft, clayey deposits can cause excessive differential settlement and pre-mature pavement damage at bridge approaches resulting from secondary consolidation settlement of the foundation soils. Such settlement is long-term in that it accumulates over many years and can produce a significant bump at the bridge approach. In some cases, the approach fills need to be reconstructed, or frequently maintained using asphalt overlays in the damaged area. Surcharging of the embankment is a common strategy used by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to reduce secondary consolidation settlement of the underlying foundation soils. Surcharging entails the construction of additional embankment above the final design subgrade in order to <b>overconsolidate</b> the foundation <b>soils.</b> Such surcharging must be sufficiently high and left in place for sufficient duration to <b>overconsolidate</b> the foundation <b>soils</b> effectively; hence reducing the amount of secondary settlement.
