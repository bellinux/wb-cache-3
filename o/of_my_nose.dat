Returning to Star Trek, but appearing {{for the first time in}} Enterprise, was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "", as well as the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b> I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|FitzRoy {{had found}} a need for expert advice on geology during the first voyage, and had {{resolved}} that if on a similar expedition, he would [...] "endeavour {{to carry out a}} person qualified to examine the land; while the officers, and myself, would attend to hydrography." [...] Command in that era could involve stress and loneliness, as shown by the suicide of Captain Stokes, and FitzRoy's own uncle Viscount Castlereagh had committed suicide under stress of overwork. His attempts to get a friend to accompany him fell through, and he asked his friend and superior, Captain Francis Beaufort, to seek a gentleman naturalist as a self-financing passenger who would give him company during the voyage. A sequence of inquiries led to Charles Darwin, a young gentleman on his way to becoming a rural clergyman, joining the voyage. Fitzroy was influenced by the physiognomy of Lavater, and Darwin recounted in his autobiography that he was nearly [...] "rejected, on account of the shape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose!</b> He was an ardent disciple of Lavater, & was convinced that he could judge a man's character by the outline of his features; & he doubted whether anyone with my nose could possess sufficient energy & determination for the voyage." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Porter {{smiled with}} {{conscious}} pride. [...] "I made it come out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> just now," [...] she replied. [...] "At least, {{some of it}} did, and I swallowed the rest. Will it hurt me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you call temptation. Haven't I the temptation of a bottle <b>of</b> wine under <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> every day <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{hands are}} blue to the wrist," [...] pleaded Villon; [...] "my feet are dead and full <b>of</b> twinges: <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> aches with the sharp air; the cold lies at my heart. I may be dead before morning. Only this once, father, and before God I will never ask again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. I {{should have}} passed the time o' day with Wayland Smith, of course. This other was different. So'--Puck made a queer {{crescent}} {{in the air with}} his finger--'I counted the blades <b>of</b> grass under <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> till the wind dropped and he had gone--he and his Hammer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; he's a worse villain {{than his}} father!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Aaron Woodward, turning to Judge Penfold; [...] "a most accomplished villain, sir." [...] And {{he shook his}} fist within an inch <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
60|$|The first {{action of}} my life was the taking hold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> with both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius: my father wept for joy and {{presented}} me with a treatise on Nosology. This I mastered before I was breeched.|$|E
6000|$|We had not {{proceeded}} {{more than}} a mile when suddenly I felt a very gentle tap on the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> and at the same moment the young lady turned her head towards me and exclaimed: [...] "It's going to rain! I felt a drop!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was greatly}} {{relieved}} {{to learn that}} they had not got a longer start of us, and very thankful that I had come up in time to join the pursuers. I was calming down somewhat under the influence of these thoughts, when I had a sudden feeling of being shot from a cannon into the air. This was succeeded by a sensation <b>of</b> having <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> converted into a ploughshare, and that was instantly followed by oblivion! ...|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} I was lying upon a truckle-bed, in a bare, half-furnished room. My head was ringing like a bell, and when I put up my hand, {{there was a}} lump like a walnut over one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. <b>My</b> <b>nose</b> was full <b>of</b> a pungent smell, and I soon found that a strip of paper soaked in vinegar was {{fastened}} across my brow. At {{the other end of}} the room this terrible little man was sitting with his knee bare, and his elderly companion was rubbing it with some liniment. The latter seemed to be in the worst of tempers, and he kept up a continual scolding, which the other listened to with a gloomy face.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{signatory}} Stanley N. Salthe, {{a visiting}} scientist at Binghamton University, State University of New York, who {{describes himself as}} an atheist, said that when he endorsed a petition {{he had no idea what}} the Discovery Institute was. Salthe stated, [...] "I signed it in irritation", and said that evolutionary biologists were being unfair in suppressing competing ideas. He said that [...] "They deserve to be prodded, as it were. It was <b>my</b> way <b>of</b> thumbing <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at them", but was unconvinced by intelligent design and concluded [...] "From <b>my</b> point <b>of</b> view, it's a plague on both your houses".|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see {{no harm in}} your saying insular,' smiled Arthur. 'I {{confess that}} I have no {{imagination}} and no sense of humour. I am a plain, practical man, but I can see to the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> with extreme clearness. Fortunately it is rather a long one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} them," [...] said he. [...] "What {{a piece of}} virtu!" [...] So he drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b> I engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the ninety-ninth edition of the [...] "Nosology," [...] with a {{portrait}} of the proboscis.--That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me to dinner.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} on Judson Tate's mind, and, {{such as it}} was, he tried to convey it to me. Already he had accepted me as his friend; and when I looked at his great, snuff-brown first-mate's hand, with which he brought emphasis to his periods, within six inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> I wondered if, by any chance, he was as sudden in conceiving enmity against strangers.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what can}} be more worthy of man's admiration and respectful affection?" [...] I argued, as I {{recovered}} my perpendicular, coughed the snow out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth and <b>nose,</b> and rubbed it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes; [...] "what more worthy of true-hearted devotion than this--this--creature of--of light; this noble child of nature--this Queen of the Wilderness?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} song: [...] "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" [...] is really sarcastic. It's really {{directed}} towards {{the people that}} we've heard year after year, record after record, saying, 'Oh, put out another record like The Fall Of Ideals. We've done that, {{and even if we}} did it, some purist would say it's tarnished anyway because we've already done it. You can't win, so (the song) is kind <b>of</b> like flicking <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at them and giving them the bird." ...|$|R
60|$|Sending a man {{fooling around}} the country after ledges, for God's sake! when there are {{hundreds}} of feet <b>of</b> them under <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> here, begging for owners, free of charge. I don't want any more feet, and I won't touch another foot--so you see, Orion, as far as any ledges of Perry's are concerned, (or any other except what I examine first with my own eyes,) I freely yield my right to share ownership with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see that," [...] said Annie; [...] "but we'll {{suppose the}} case, {{for the sake}} of argument. What {{do you expect me to}} do in theatricals, in-doors or out? I never took part in {{anything}} of the kind; I can't see an inch beyond the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> without glasses; I never could learn the simplest thing by heart; I'm clumsy and awkward; I get confused." ...|$|E
6000|$|O-o-o-o-h! it's once I froze the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> [...] On {{the coast}} of Labrador, sir, [...] An' I lost my smell, an' my taste as well, [...] An' my pipe, which made me roar, sir; [...] But the traders come, an' think wot they done! [...] They poked an' pinched an' {{skewered}} me; [...] They cut an' snipped, an' they carved an' ripped, [...] An' they clothed an' fed an' cured me.|$|E
6000|$|... "P'raps, 'owever I {{got to the}} 'oss first. I didn't {{take time}} to mount, but went leap-frog over 'is tail slap into the saddle, which gave the hold 'oss such a skeer that 'e bolted! The Kafir 'e gave a yell an' sent 'is assagai after me, an' by bad luck I looks round just as it went past an' all but took off the point <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b> Wasn't it unlucky?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... . I HAVE {{been walking}} these last days {{from place to}} place; and it does make it hot for walking with a sack in this weather. I am burned in horrid patches <b>of</b> red; <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> I fear, {{is going to take}} the lead in colour; Simpson is all flushed, as if he were seen by a sunset. I send you here two rondeaux; I don't suppose they will amuse anybody but me; but this measure, short and yet intricate, is just what I desire; and I have had some good times walking along the glaring roads, or down the poplar alley of the great canal, pitting my own humour to this old verse.|$|R
5000|$|Kesari then {{released}} {{a phone conversation}} regarding Benton's employment with the McConnell campaign, in which Benton said he was [...] "sort <b>of</b> holding <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> for two years because what we're doing here {{is going to be}} a big benefit for Rand in 2016." [...] The incident was referred to on Twitter as [...] "nosegate." [...] In response to Kesari's actions, Benson stated, [...] ""It is truly sick that someone would record a private phone conversation I had out of kindness and use it to try to hurt me. I believe in Senator McConnell and am 100 percent committed to his re-election. Being selected to lead his campaign is one of the great honors <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life and I look forward to victory in November of 2014." [...] The McConnell campaign stated that Benton would [...] "absolutely" [...] keep his job with the campaign.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} that {{happened}} to me after parting with him was to find myself again engaged with Mrs. Brissenden, still full of the quick conviction with which I had left her. [...] "It is she--quite unmistakably, you know. I don't see how I can have been so stupid as not to make it out. I haven't your cleverness, <b>of</b> course, till <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> is rubbed into a thing. But when it is--!" [...] She celebrated her humility in a laugh that was proud. [...] "The two are off together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much {{or little}} I {{take it to}} heart you know nothin' {{whatever}} about, my boy, seein' that I don't wear my heart on my coat-sleeve, nor yet on the point <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> for the inspection of all and sundry. Besides, you can't tell whether it's a bad or a good endin', for it has not ended yet one way or another. Moreover, what appears bad is often found to be good, an' what seems good is pretty often uncommon bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|I now {{discovered}} to my extreme delight that I could have spoken had not my mouth been {{tied up with}} the pocket-handkerchief. Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally repeating some passages of the [...] "Omnipresence of the Deity," [...] as is my custom before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and vituperative turn, entering at {{a hole in the}} wall, leaped up with a flourish a la Catalani, and alighting opposite one another on my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
6000|$|That the [...] "show"--if again I may be {{permitted}} the local idiom--was not entirely mine I was well aware. That not alone my person but my property also was being damaged {{in the rear}} became dimly conveyed to me through the sensation of draught. Already {{the world to the}} left of me was mere picturesque perspective, while the growing importance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> was threatening the absorption of all my other features. These things did not trouble me. I merely noted them as phenomena and continued to punch steadily.|$|E
6000|$|He took up {{his letters}} in his large hand and, {{crushing}} them together, {{held it out to}} me. “That stack of postal matter,” he said, “is worth about five cents. But I guess,” he added, rising, “that I know where I am by this time.” When I had drawn my money I asked him to come and breakfast with me at the little brasserie, much favoured by students, to which I used to resort in the old town. “I couldn’t eat, sir,” he frankly pleaded, “I couldn’t eat. Bad disappointments strike at the seat of the appetite. But I guess I’ll go with you, {{so as not to be}} on show down there at the pension. The old woman down there accuses me <b>of</b> turning up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at her food. Well, I guess I shan’t turn up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at anything now.” ...|$|R
60|$|So he {{set down}} on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and {{stretched}} his legs out till one of them most touched one <b>of</b> mine. <b>My</b> <b>nose</b> begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.|$|R
6000|$|He took up {{his letters}} in his large hand, and {{crushing}} them together, {{held it out to}} me. [...] "That epistolary matter," [...] he said, [...] "is worth about five cents. But I guess," [...] he added, rising, [...] "I have taken it in by this time." [...] When I had drawn my money I asked him to come and breakfast with me at the little brasserie, much favoured by students, to which I used to resort in the old town. [...] "I couldn't eat, sir," [...] he said, [...] "I--couldn't eat. Bad news takes away the appetite. But I guess I'll go with you, so that I needn't go to table down there at the pension. The old woman down there is always accusing me <b>of</b> turning up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at her food. Well, I guess I shan't turn up <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> at anything now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Turnbull, {{advancing}} on him {{swiftly and}} with animated gestures, [...] "why does teething hurt? Why do growing pains hurt? Why are measles catching? Why does a rose have thorns? Why do rhinoceroses have horns? Why is the horn {{on the top}} of the nose? Why haven't I a horn on the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> eh?" [...] And he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the Creator.|$|E
6000|$|As he drew {{nearer the}} words became intelligible. [...] "Howld him tight, now! d'ye hear? Och! whereiver have ye gone an' lost yersilf? Howld him tight till I come an' help ye! What! is it {{let him go}} ye have? Ah then it's wishin' I had {{the eyes of a}} cat this night for I can't rightly see the length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose.</b> Sure ye've niver gone an' let him go? Don't say so, now!" [...] wound up Paddy as, issuing from the wood, he {{advanced}} into the circle of light.|$|E
60|$|Next day I {{started for}} Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London to see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on {{becoming}} very intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run {{a very narrow}} risk of being rejected, {{on account of the}} shape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>nose!</b> He was an ardent disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's character by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had spoken falsely.|$|E
60|$|Jul. Come, I'll have no {{whispering}} betwixt you; I {{know you}} were talking <b>of</b> <b>my</b> husband, because <b>my</b> <b>nose</b> itches.|$|R
60|$|There was myself. I {{spoke of}} myself;--of myself, of myself, of myself;--of Nosology, <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pamphlet, and <b>of</b> myself. I turned up <b>my</b> <b>nose,</b> and I spoke of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I searched to {{see what}} there was with which I could tie him. I drew the strings from my shoes, and with one I secured his wrists, and with another his ankles. Then I tied the cravat round his mouth again, {{so that he could}} only lie and glare at me. When I had done all this, and had stopped the {{bleeding}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>nose,</b> I looked out of the coach and ah, monsieur, the very first thing which caught my eyes was that candle--that dear little candle--glimmering in the window of the minister. Alone, with these two hands, I had retrieved the capitulation of an army and the loss of a province. Yes, monsieur, what Abercrombie and 5,000 men had done upon the beach at Aboukir was undone by me, single-handed, in a hackney coach in Harley Street.|$|R
