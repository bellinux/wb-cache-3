30|$|There are two {{important}} reasons that these figures {{may differ from}} true <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> Because the program provides some services that would be obtained elsewhere, it reduces expenses—either by participants or others— {{that would otherwise be}} incurred; this causes <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> to be smaller than actual direct costs. In their benefit-cost analysis of the JTPA program, Orr et al.

When environmental impacts are unaccounted, the marketplace fails {{to consider the}} full costs of products and services in decision making. This market failure is arguably at the source {{of many of the}} environmental problems we face today. Full cost pricing seeks to remove market failures by determining a price that includes all costs.

There is no study assessing {{the impact of}} HCV infection on premature deaths in Spain. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate productivity losses because of premature deaths attributable to hepatitis C occurring in Spain during 2007 – 2011. Materials and methods We use data from several sources (Registry of Deaths, Labour Force Survey and Wage Structure Survey) to develop a simulation model based on the human capital approach and to estimate the flows in labour productivity losses in the period considered. The attributable fraction method was used to estimate the numbers of deaths associated with HCV infection. Two sensitivity analyses were developed to test the robustness of the results. Results Our model shows total productivity losses attributable to HCV infection of 1054. 7 million euros over the period analysed. The trend in productivity losses is decreasing over the period. This result is because of improvements in health outcomes, reflected in the reduction of the number of years of potential productive life lost. Of the total estimated losses, 18. 6 % were because of hepatitis C, 24. 6 % because of hepatocellular carcinoma, 30. 1 % because of cirrhosis, 15. 9 % because of other liver diseases and 10. 7 % because of HIV–HCV coinfection. Conclusion The results show that premature mortality attributable to hepatitis C involves significant productivity losses. This highlights the need to extend the analysis to consider <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> and obtain a more complete picture of the actual economic impact of hepatitis C infection.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To establish excess costs associated with depression in South Australia, based on the prevalence of depression (from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD)) and associated excess burden of depression (BoD) costs. Method: Using data from the 1988 South Australian (SA) Health Omnibus Survey, a properly weighted cross-sectional survey of SA adults, we calculated excess costs using two methods. First, we estimated the excess cost based on health service provision and loss of productivity. Second, we estimated it from loss of utility. Results: We found symptoms of major depression in 7 % of the SA population, and 11 % for other depression. Those with major depression reported worse health status, took more time off work, reported more work performance limitations, made greater use of health services and reported poorer health-related quality-of-life. Using the service provision perspective excess BoD costs were AUD$ 1921 million per annum. Importantly, this excluded non-health service and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> (e. g. family breakdown, legal costs). With the utility approach, using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instrument and a very modest life-value (AUD$ 50 000), the estimate was AUD$ 2800 million. This reflects a societal perspective {{of the value of}} illness, hence there is no particular reason the two different methods should agree as they provide different kinds of information. Both methods suggest estimating the excess BoD from the direct service provision perspective is too restrictive, and that indirect and societal costs ought be taken into account. Conclusions: Despite the high ranking of depression as a major health problem, it is often unrecognized and undertreated. The findings mandate action to explore ways of reducing the BoD borne by individuals, those affected by their illness, the health system and society generally. Given the limited information on the cost-effectiveness of different treatments, it would seem important that resources be allocated to evaluating alternative depression treatments.

A numerical example based on U.
