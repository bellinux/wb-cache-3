5|$|In 2012, Barrowman guest {{presented}} three episodes <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> with Kate Thornton.|$|E
25|$|The show's format was {{devised by}} X Factor creator and Sony Music executive, Simon Cowell, who was {{involved}} in the creation of other Got Talent programmes across several different countries. To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, Fern Britton (at the time, presenter <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning),</b> as well as tabloid journalist Piers Morgan. The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series entitled The Talent Show Story in January 2012.|$|E

Head of climate change for WWF in Britain, said that the proposals made so far, especially those from industrialised countries [...] "all far short of what the world needs".|$|E

60|$|I am here {{within five}} {{miles of the}} scene <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> action. I have nothing to add to what General Meade reports except that I have seen the prisoners myself and they look like there might be the number he states--1600.|$|R
50|$|The show first {{aired in}} 2002, when Radio One {{management}} split its former <b>morning</b> program, <b>This</b> Morning, into two new programs: The Current {{took over the}} news portion <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>Mornings</b> programming, and Sounds Like Canada looked at {{the impact of the}} news on people.|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{note with}} dismay and regret the events <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation. It {{is a source}} of great sadness that {{there have been a number}} of {{fatalities}} in this attack and it is also very upsetting for the wider cricket family that some of the Sri Lanka players and one match official have been injured in this attack. At this time our thoughts and prayers are with the injured people and also the families of those who have died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his death, many {{charities}} {{revealed that}} Michael had privately been {{a supporter of}} them for many years. Dame Esther Rantzen, the {{founder and president of}} Childline, said he had given them [...] "millions" [...] over the years and said that he had given the royalties from his 1996 number one single [...] "Jesus to a Child" [...] to the charity. He had supported the Terrence Higgins Trust [...] "for many years" [...] as well as Macmillan Cancer Support. Michael also donated to individuals: he reportedly called the production team of the quiz show Deal or No Deal after a contestant had revealed that she needed £15,000 to fund IVF treatment, and anonymously paid for the treatment personally; and once tipped a student nurse working as a barmaid £5,000 ($6,121) because she was in debt. On 3 January 2017, another woman came forward and (with the permission of Michael's family) revealed he had anonymously paid for her IVF treatment after seeing her talk about her problems conceiving on an episode <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> in 2010. The woman gave birth to a girl in 2012.|$|E
60|$|Your {{despatch}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> is just received, and I fear I do not perfectly understand it.|$|E
60|$|I {{would not}} take my folio paper for this epistle, and now I repent it. I am so jaded with my dirty long journey, that I was afraid to drawl into the essence of dulness with {{anything}} larger than a quarto, and so I must leave out another rhyme <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> manufacture.|$|R
6000|$|... "The totals are enormous, sir," [...] he admitted, [...] "and you {{may take}} it that they are {{absolutely}} correct. They represent our holdings as revised after the receipt <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> mail. I should like to point out, too, sir, that they have increased out of all proportion to outside shipments, during the last four days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite right," [...] said Arnold, good-humoredly. [...] "The fact is--I'm out <b>of</b> sorts, <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> My mind misgives me--I don't know why." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Very well,' said John {{in quiet}} despair. 'Then {{there is no}} way of {{accounting}} for my visitor <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> So we'll not try, Tom.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not believe, madam," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "that any {{one could}} have taken more {{interest}} in the exercises <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> than we have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Exit LADY WINDERMERE R.] You seem rather out <b>of</b> temper <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Windermere. Why {{should you}} be? Margaret and I get on charmingly together.|$|R
6000|$|... "And when must {{we go to}} the Lyddells? I {{thought he}} meant more than mere civility, when he spoke <b>of</b> Oakworthy <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> at breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. I mean, about {{making such a}} most ghastly ass <b>of</b> myself <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I... I never dreamed you {{understood}} English." ...|$|R
6000|$|She met it, {{the wonder}} she had stirred. [...] "In the cold dim dawn, you say? Well, {{in the cold}} dim dawn <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I too saw you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should hardly expect {{all that}} from our {{acquaintance}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but I am disappointed, though I'm sure I don't know why I should be," [...] said Helen Savine.|$|E
60|$|SIR:--Your note <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> is received. You will co-operate by {{the revenue}} cutters under your {{direction}} with the navy in arresting rebel depredations on American commerce and transportation and in capturing rebels engaged therein.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! A {{threatening}} letter!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why, I had a dozen <b>of</b> those <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> My {{secretary is}} making a scrapbook of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better. The night's rest, and a {{wash and}} change <b>of</b> clothes <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{have made me}} feel another man. How far {{do you intend to}} march?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Bittock's Bridge,] August 26.--We {{took our}} {{departure}} from the friendly halls <b>of</b> Drumlanrig <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> after breakfast and leave-taking. I trust this young nobleman will be ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{tone and}} manner, my good friend, {{are no doubt}} {{provoked}} by the report in the newspaper <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> In justice to you, I refuse to believe the report." [...] So Mrs. Newsham adopted her friend's suggestion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is a capital plan. I do not mind a share of fair fighting; but to be shot down {{suddenly}} in an ambush like that <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I own I have little fancy for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was much}} {{astonished}} at {{the contents of}} your letter <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and greatly concerned that Mr. Cavendish Dusautoy should have done so much honour to any production of mine, as to alter his arrangements on that account.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am hungry, de Thiou, now I come {{to think}} of it, for except a crust <b>of</b> bread <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I have not touched {{anything}} today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had {{a dreadful}} fit <b>of</b> raving <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{and we had}} to tie her down in bed. She is quieter now, poor dear. There, listen!" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> work {{two or three}} {{apparently}} distant peals of thunder were heard, and the atmosphere suddenly became thick and foggy. But as the Smeaton, our present tender, was moored at no great distance from the rock, the crew on board continued blowing with a horn, and occasionally fired a musket, so that the boats got to the ship without difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the reader}} will not be {{surprised}} that, {{within a few months}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> walk, the hands of George, Lord Cadurcis, and Venetia Herbert were joined in the chapel at Cherbury by the good Masham. Peace be with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not only}} mean love of oneself," [...] said Mrs. Evelyn, gently. [...] "I was {{thinking}} of the fine gold we heard <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> When our boys once have found that secret, the chief of our work is done." ...|$|E
6000|$|In my reply, I {{point out}} that, on the 10th of January, Mr. Stead {{addressed}} to me a letter, which commences thus: [...] "I {{see in the}} 'Times' <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that {{you are about to}} republish your letters on Booth's book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s Applejack Joe,” {{said the}} policeman, as he eyed the prisoner. “We warned him out <b>of</b> town <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> What {{was he going}} to do, steal a ride?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly I shall do so, unless I dispose <b>of</b> it <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> When {{we were at}} Noningsby together, I {{ventured to}} tell you what I felt for you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was reading}} the second chapter <b>of</b> Malachi <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> by chance, and {{wondering}} how many clergymen ever read it, and took to heart the [...] "commandment for them." ...|$|R
