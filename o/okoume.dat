There are few international standards for grading marine plywood {{and most of the}} standards are voluntary. Some marine plywood has a Lloyd's of London stamp that certifies it to be BS 1088 compliant. Some plywood is also labeled based on the wood used to manufacture it. Examples of this are <b>Okoumé</b> or Meranti.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the ancients}} lost {{confidence}} in the Saas, the Somb tree (prosopis africana a species of prosopis) was adopted. The Somb {{is one of the}} largest and most mysterious trees found in Serer country. Its wood is very hard and resistant to rot. It is harder than cailcedrat and <b>Okoumé.</b> It is the same wood found in the Serer tumuli that are still intact for over a thousand years. The pegs lining the burial chamber of the Serer notables mummified and interned in their tombs have not been not [...] eaten away by termites and are still intact in spite of the passage of time. In 1976-8, Descamp and his team carried out an archaeological excavation of these ancient sites. Gold, silver, armour (a golden pectoral in particular), metal and other grave goods were found in these burial chambers. [...] The town Somb, in present-day Senegal, took its name from this tree. The Somb tree is the symbol of immortality in Serer religious symbolism. The Somb is viewed as the Tree of Life by most Serers who adhere to the tenets of Serer religion. That is the orthodox view. In the creation myth, it is the only tree that provides a strong challenge to the Nqual tree. While Nqual was the first three on Earth since it grew within the primordial swamp, the Somb tree, is the seed that produced it and all the plant species that populated the world.|$|E

50|$|Exploitation {{had been}} hampered, to some extent, by the {{inadequacy}} of transportation infrastructure, a deficiency now alleviated by the Trans-Gabon Railway and Ndjole-Bitam highway. Reforestation has been continuously promoted, and selective thinning and clearing have prevented the <b>okoumé</b> from being forced out by other species. Over 50 firms are engaged in exploitation of Gabon’s forests. Logging concessions covering about 50000 km2 have been granted by the government, {{with the development of}} the least accessible areas largely carried out by foreign firms. Traditional demand in Europe for African lumber products has declined in recent years; during the 1980s, European demand for <b>okoumé</b> dropped by almost one-third. Markets in Japan, Morocco, and Israel, however, have become more receptive to African imports.|$|E
50|$|Gabon {{supplies}} 90% of the world’s <b>okoumé,</b> {{which makes}} excellent plywood, and also produces hardwoods, such as mahogany, kevazingo, and ebony. Other woods are dibetou (tigerwood or African walnut), movingui (Nigerian satinwood), and zingana (zebrano or zebrawood). Roundwood removals were estimated at 4 million cubic meters in 2004, with 13% used as fuel wood.|$|E

50|$|Gabon’s forests, which cover an {{estimated}} 77% of its land surface, have always supplied {{many of the}} necessities of life, especially fuel and shelter. The forests contain over 400 species of trees, with about 100 species suitable for industrial use. Commercial exploitation began as early as 1892, but only in 1913 was <b>okoumé,</b> Gabon’s most valuable wood, introduced to the international market.|$|E
5000|$|Sheet plywood boat {{building}} uses {{sheets of}} plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers {{which are all}} bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction. A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method {{is known as the}} stitch-and-glue method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated [...] "WBP" [...] (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be 1.2 mm minimum) or are very thin (less than 0.5 mm) or high-grade surface ply such as <b>Okoume</b> is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine <b>Okoume</b> (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be [...] "A" [...] quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at [...] it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 <b>Okoume).</b> Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and <b>Okoume</b> ply F8. <b>Okoume</b> ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the Vaurien, Cherub, Tolman, Moth and P class (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and Kolibris (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it. Another variation is tortured ply where very thin(3 mm) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.|$|E
50|$|Their traditions {{hold that}} they {{arrived from the}} east or southeast, coming down the Sebe River to the Ogowe, and thence to the Doumé rapids. They made canoes of <b>Okoumé,</b> and sold slaves to the Okandé, {{receiving}} European products such as guns and cloth in exchange. The Société du Haut-Ogooué (SHO) established a post at Lastoursville and engaged the Adouma in trade for rubber, ivory, and ebony.|$|E
50|$|The Féré F.3 {{is almost}} entirely wooden in {{structure}} and skinning, though some areas are fabric covered. The one piece, low set wing is built around a single box spar, with its leading edge covered in <b>okoumé</b> plywood under an overall fabric covering. The inner sections of the wings have no dihedral but the outer panels are set at 5.80°. There are plain, fabric covered ailerons on the outer panels but no flaps.|$|E

50|$|Aucoumea klaineana (Angouma, Gaboon, or <b>Okoumé)</b> is {{a tree in}} {{the family}} Burseraceae, native to {{equatorial}} west Africa in Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Rio Muni. It is a medium-sized hardwood tree growing to 30-40 m tall, rarely larger, with a trunk 1-2.5 m diameter above the often large basal buttresses. The tree generally grows in small stands, {{the roots of the}} trees intertwined with neighboring trees. In Gabon it is the primary timber species.|$|E
50|$|Jodel {{aircraft}} are all-wood, usually made from Sitka spruce and plywood {{made out of}} <b>okoume</b> (also known as gaboon), a kind of West African hardwood. Most of the designs are recognisable by their distinctive wings, which have ‘cranked’ dihedral only on the outer third. The wings also incorporate washout, retaining aileron effectiveness at or {{just prior to the}} stall. From above or below, the wings are also distinctive as this cranked section of the wing tapers sharply towards the wingtip.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Akendengué {{recorded}} his first album, Nandipo, {{which consisted of}} songs of his own composition, sung in French and Nkomi, accompanied by guitar, women choir, bass and the percussion of Nana Vasconcelos. He later set to music poems by P. E. Mondjegou, such as [...] "Le Chant du Coupeur d'Okoumé" [...] ("The Song of the <b>Okoumé</b> Cutter"). Returning to Gabon, he studied solfeggio and plainchant at a Catholic college, and presented spectacles showcasing traditional Gabonese forms in a concert setting.|$|E
50|$|Its {{one piece}} {{cantilever}} wing had spruce plywood box spars and ribs and was <b>okoumé</b> plywood covered. It {{was attached to}} the upper fuselage longerons at six points and had a 4 m centre section of constant chord and thickness. Beyond, the wing thinned from its underside, creating positive dihedral and became semi-elliptical in plan. Long (2.8 m, more than 60% of the half-span) ailerons, unusually mounted inboard and gently decreasing in chord outboard, produced an overall wing plan close to the ideal ellipse.|$|E
50|$|The timber {{industry}} {{of the country}} was exploited by the French from the 1940s. Before independence some 80% of the population were involved in agriculture. In the late 1960s forest products were responsible for over 60 percent of total exports from the country, but by the 1980s petroleum accounted for 90 percent of exports. The country is a leading nation in the production of limba and <b>okoumé</b> woods. Tuna, bass, sole, and sardines are caught off Pointe-Noire for commercial purposes, although the fishing industry is relatively small.|$|E
5000|$|The {{supporters}} of the symbol are panthers which symbolize the vigilance and courage of the president who protects the nation. The bezants (golden discs) {{in chief of the}} shield symbolize the mineral wealth of the country. The ship at the lower part represents Gabon moving towards a brighter future. According to Briggs, [...] "green represents the great dense forests; yellow, the sun; blue, the sea; and black, the people of Africa". The <b>okoumé</b> tree {{at the top of the}} shield symbolizes the timber trade.|$|E

The album was also mixed by Carl Bastien, {{who has worked with}} many Québécois artists such as Daniel Bélanger, Dumas and Jean-Pierre Ferland.|$|E
5000|$|Timber from Río Muni is Equatorial Guinea’s leading export. Forests cover over 62 {{percent of}} the land area. The Río Muni area on the {{mainland}} produces <b>okoumé</b> and akoga from rain forests of considerable age. Even though the government has given permission to foreign firms, exploitation is difficult due to infrastructural problems. The government enacted a new forestry action plan in 1990 in an effort to strengthen the sector’s development. In 2004, roundwood production was estimated at 811,000 cubic metres. In 2004, exports of forest products amounted to $97 million: ...|$|E
50|$|Forestry was {{the primary}} source of {{economic}} activity in the country until 1968, when the industry was supplanted by crude oil as an earner of foreign exchange. Gabon is the largest exporter of raw wood in the region, and its sales represent 20% of Africa’s raw wood exports. Forestry is second only to the petroleum sector in export earnings, at $319.4 million in 2003. Gabon’s reserves of exploitable timber include: <b>okoumé,</b> 100 million cubic meters; ozigo, 25-35 million cubic meters; ilomba, 20-30 million cubic meters; azobé, 15-25 million cubic meters; and padouk, 10-20 million cubic meters.|$|E
50|$|In {{the form}} known as <b>okoume</b> marine grade plywood, it is {{considered}} perhaps the finest construction plywood now available for boats especially where lighter weight is needed. It is widely available manufactured and certified to British Standard 1088. Its users range from individual hobbyist kayak builders {{to some of the}} world's largest boat builders. Most often it is used in combination with epoxy and fiberglass, the combination giving a structure that can be stronger and lighter than plastic or fiberglass, rivaling the performance characteristics of more advanced composites such as carbon fiber. The grain appearance is prized, likened to that of mahogany and is often varnished for a decorative appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of the}} Pou-Push's {{fuselage}} was all wood, with spruce {{frames and}} longerons covered in <b>okoumé</b> ply. Composite materials {{were used for the}} upper decking and nosecone; the ventral surface was fabric covered. The single seat placed the pilot under the forward wing leading edge, covered by a one-piece removable canopy. An ungeared 22 kW (30 hp) Hirth 276R inline two-stroke engine on top of the rear wing drove a fixed pitch wooden pusher propeller just beyond the trailing edge. The Pou-Push had a fixed tricycle undercarriage with its mainwheels on wire braced, single piece, composite arched legs. The nosewheel was steerable and fitted with brakes.|$|E

50|$|In 1722, pirates led by Bartholomew Roberts {{fought a}} {{battle in the}} Cape Lopez Bay against the Royal Navy. The {{encounter}} ended in Roberts' death. The settlement was established on Mandji Island in the delta of the Ogooué River by the French, who signed a treaty with the Orungu people in 1873. It {{was used as a}} base for the expeditions of de Brazza into the interior, then in 1894 a customs post was set up, becoming the nucleus of a trading center that included Hatton & Cookson, John Holt, Woermann, Société du Haut-Ogooué, and Compagnie d'Exploitations Forestières Africaines. The main products were initially rubber and ivory, gradually supplemented by woods, particularly <b>okoumé</b> for plywood.The town was named after the French colonial administrator Émile Gentil in 1900. After World War I it became a port for timber, but it grew rapidly only after Elf began oil exploration in the area. It received its first bank branch when Bank of West Africa (BAO) opened a branch there in 1928.|$|E
50|$|Epoxy resin -a {{chemical}} fluid {{widely used}} in advanced wooden boat building since the 1980s {{in a variety of}} forms, principally glue, as a filler (with a variety of powders or sawdust) and as a moisture-resistant barrier on both the interior and exterior of a wooden hull. The method was popularized by the WEST system. Sometimes used in conjunction with various cloths such as fibreglass, kevlar or carbon fibre. A thinned mixture of resin is used to penetrate the fibres of light weight woods such as Balsa and Western red cedar forming a waterproof barrier, far superior to single pot paint or varnish. In small boat and kayak construction Epoxy resin is often used in conjunction with lightweight 3 or 4 mm thick <b>Okoume</b> (Gaboon) plywood to form very light strong hulls. Typically few nails or screws are needed as the resin is so strong. Slow drying and far stronger but more difficult to sand than polyester resin. Typically applied with a roller, throw away brushes and radiused flat tongue depressor for coving using thickened epoxy. Softens and weakens slightly at high ambient temperatures so vessels in tropical waters should be lighter coloured.|$|E
50|$|Equatorial Guinea {{has other}} largely unexploited human and natural resources, {{including}} a tropical climate, fertile soils, rich expanses of water, deepwater ports, and an untapped, if unskilled, source of labor. Following independence in 1968, the country suffered under a repressive dictatorship for 11 years, which devastated the economy. The agricultural sector, which historically {{was known for}} cocoa of the highest quality, has never fully recovered. In 1969 Equatorial Guinea produced 36,161 tons of highly bid cocoa, but production dropped to 4,800 tons in 2000. Coffee production also dropped sharply during this period to bounce back to 100,000 metric tons in 2000. Timber is {{the main source of}} foreign exchange after oil, accounting for about 12.4% of total export earnings in 1996-99. Timber production increased steadily during the 1990s; wood exports reached a record 789,000 cubic meters in 1999 as demand in Asia (mainly China) gathered pace after the 1998 economic crisis. Most of the production (mainly <b>Okoume)</b> goes to exports, and only 3% is processed locally. Environmentalists fear that exploitation at this level is unsustainable and point out to the permanent damage already inflicted on the forestry reserves on Bioko.|$|E

50|$|Plywood is {{especially}} popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids {{in the interior}} layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil {{should not be used}} on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe)caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as mahogany, <b>okoumé,</b> iroko, Keruing, azobé and merbau. are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed FSC-certified. Teak or iroko is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. Glue, screws, rivets and/or nails are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.|$|E

This study {{described}} the mycorrhizal status of <b>okoume</b> (Aucoumea klaineana Pierre), an endemic burseraceae of the humid forests of Gabon. Like most tropical forest timbers, <b>okoume</b> forms arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Mycorrhizal root colonisation of <b>okoume</b> in artificial regeneration was investigated on trees planted between 1950 and 1989 in the Kienke Reserve of south Cameroon.

DBH was highly positively correlated to tree age but negatively to percent root colonisation (PRC). The highest PRC was reached fifteen years after planting, and declined thereafter, suggesting that adult trees of <b>okoume</b> could exert a control over mycorrhizal colonisation. In {{the absence of}} selective clear-cuttings, the relatively good growth performance of <b>okoume</b> outside of its natural growth range appears to be sustained by diverse mycorrhizal associations.
