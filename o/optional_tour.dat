25|$|The route {{now heads}} back inland towards the next village of Gimingham {{this part of}} the trail passes through the valley of the River Mun. The {{countryside}} along this section is pleasant and very peaceful. One usual sight {{to the north of the}} ‘Trail’ is the giant white sphere which can be glimpsed occasionally. This is the Trimingham Early warning station which is in fact part of RAF Neatishead. The path enters the village of Gimingham past the rebuilt old corn watermill and the preserved steam engine. Like Mundesley, Gimingham parish church is called All Saints. It is south down the main street from the engine. From this point there is an <b>optional</b> <b>tour</b> which takes in the villages of Trunch, Swafield, Bradfield and then back on itself to Trimingham and its unusually named church St John the Baptist’s Head.|$|E
5000|$|I [...] Regular {{programs}} are offered throughout the year. Two types of regular {{programs are}} offered; 1-month group programs, and private programs. A 1-month group {{program is a}} package consisting of the followings: a 1-month long intensive Arabic language course, a comfortable accommodation, airpor pickup, and an <b>optional</b> <b>tour</b> to a touristic site in Jordan. In the a 1-month group program a student takes 80 hours of Arabic language instruction; 5 times a week, 4-hours each time, {{for a period of}} 4 weeks. The 80-hour program is equal to a 4-credit course in most universities. Students wishing to study for longer periods can cover consecutive levels of Arabic. Private regular programs are offered anytime of the year. These programs are more flexible since students can take as many hours as they wish and for the duration they need. For both types of regular programs students may request the type of Arabic language they wish to learn; MSA (Modern Standard Arabic), Media Arabic, or Colloquial Arabic. Elementary, intermediate and advanced classes are opened in each month {{to meet the demands of}} people having different backgrounds in Arabic. A placement test will be given to the registered students before the start of the course to determine the level and accordingly the appropriate class they should enroll in.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} China's Generation Y's (Gen Y) preference toward joining group package tour (GPT) when traveling abroad and explore their expectations {{on a number}} of service attributes. Six service attribute dimensions were identified through factor analysis, including: group leader/local guide(s), <b>optional</b> <b>tour</b> and shopping arrangement, safety, cleanness, and comfortableness, accommodation, activities, and shopping length and frequency. This study confirmed the importance of group leader/local guide(s) with a special emphasis on their honesty. It is found that current group and non-group travelers of Gen Y shared similar expectations on six service feature dimensions, while having different expectations on four service attributes: food hygiene, tour leader's emergency handle ability, Chinese food offering, and park as attraction choice. Results also showed that potential group travelers had higher concern over the factor of group leader/local guide(s) than non-group travelers. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} century, {{a new form}} of tourism, which is a landing-type tourism (<b>optional</b> <b>tour)</b> in {{contrast}} with a departing-type tourism, has been attracting attention. The landing-type tourism is that local communities take the initiative in using local resources as tourist resources, which is also {{regarded as one of the}} effective approaches for disaster recovery. In July 2012, the area of the Hoshino Village, Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, sustained significant damage caused by the heavy rains in Northern Kyushu. Accordingly, the author conducted a questionnaire survey targeting the residents of the Hoshino Village, who experienced the heavy rains, with an aim to understand how they see the current issues of their local communities and how they think about the possibilities of realizing the landing-type tourism. Based on the acknowledgement, the author advances discussions with the goal of determining the ways of tourism in the village in the future. Findings from the questionnaires reveal that the residents of the village are concerned about the village's future as a tourism destination, after suffering from the disaster. In addition, as for the changes in the consciousness of residents, there is also a positive impact, as they rediscover the resources for tourism. From these findings, it is believed that the landing-type tourism will allow the residents of the Hoshino Village to rediscover their local areas and as a result, it revitalizes local communities, leading to achieve the disaster recovery. この論文は「地域環境研究 : 環境教育研究マネジメントセンター年報」（第 5 号 2013 年p 27 - 38 ）に掲載された論文を査読により加筆修正し、「九州地区国立大学教育系・文系研究論文集」Vol. 1, No. 1 (2013 / 10 ）に採択されたものである...|$|E

It's very, very scary for anybody when it's big sea, rough sea in those small boats, it's no joke. As for the cowboy boat operators in Sabah, if one doesn't take the offer, others will and so the seller in China need not worry about transport.

As the main players on the Baltic and North Sea stages, the area’s capital cities, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Oslo and St. Petersburg, have long been acting on and reacting to each other.

It was the centerpiece of a private residence for many years, but now is surrounded by a small hotel (The Inn at Blackbeard's Castle), a pool, and a snack bar that is open when the grounds are open for tours.

Canadensis Upper Seniors spend 3 days and 2 nights sightseeing in Boston. Although the exact details change every year, common attractions include a Boston Duck Tour, lunch at Fire and Ice, Quincy Market, and a tour of Harvard University. Super Seniors spend 4 days in Niagara, and take part in traditional tourist attractions, such as Maid of the Mist. In 2010, the Niagara Falls trip will also include a Cleveland, OH component, so campers can experience the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Canadensis CITs (Counselors-In-Training) spend 5 days at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.

5000|$|Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado {{received}} {{very few}} changes for 1987. A price drop, to $23,740, {{did not raise}} sales any, as only 17,775 were made this year (21,342 for 1986). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the <b>optional</b> ($155) <b>Touring</b> Suspension, with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" [...] alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage [...] "chop-shop" [...] thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat belt reels for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singluar options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers {{to be used for}} the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the square marker lamp, located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 & '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.|$|R
