5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state</b> to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state,</b> introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ACLU <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> {{joined with}} a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed {{in a lawsuit}} against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable {{restrictions}} upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E
5|$|The Cascadia {{subduction}} zone rarely influences the western portion <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state,</b> but the November 1873 M7.3 shock near the California–Oregon border {{may have been}} associated with it. Although activity in the Pacific Northwest (especially west of the Cascades in Washington) has occasionally been located near the {{subduction zone}}, earthquakes there (1949 Olympia, 1965 Puget Sound, 2001 Nisqually) have mostly been intraslab events. A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well {{due to the lack of}} instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state.</b> Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State</b> University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>State.</b> There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>state.</b> Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E
