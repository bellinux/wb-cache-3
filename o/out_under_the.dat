5|$|The Old White Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and {{described}} as a late 16th-century building. The building was an end entry house but it is unclear when it became an inn. It has been suspected that the building was previously used as a courthouse, but this has never been proved. Moreover, tokens were given <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Old White Hart's name in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E

5|$|During Ceolnoth's archbishopric, monastic life {{declined}} {{under the}} pressure of the Viking attacks, and there was a noticeable decline in the quality of the books and other works produced by the scriptoriums. A number of monasteries died <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> pressure of the raids by the invaders, who wintered over in Kent in 851 and 855. He held councils in 839 and 845, the second at London.

Ceolnoth is also known to have corresponded with Pope Leo IV.|$|E
5|$|For the breakout, the Marines {{formed into}} a convoy {{with a single}} M4A3 Sherman tank as the lead. The plan was to have 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5) as {{the vanguard of the}} convoy, with three battalions {{covering}} the rear. At the same time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass. To start the breakout, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) had to first attack south and capture Hill 1542 and Hill 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks. The breakout was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims.

Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out to the spire in 1946–47 under the {{supervision}} of architect Kenneth Dalgleish, following damage sustained during the Second World War. In 1957, the bells were again repaired. On 25 August 1959, the church was added to the register of listed buildings. It is Grade I listed. The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice, rector of Mereworth from 1966–70. A new fibreglass clock face was fitted at this time and the winding mechanism converted to electric power. In 2005, an inspection revealed that the church needed major repairs. English Heritage made a grant that covered 95% of the £500,000 cost of restoration. The work was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of architects Thomas Ford & Partners, and won the 2009 Georgian Group award for best restoration of a Georgian church.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, Porto Alegre {{received}} {{instructions from}} Mitre {{to attack the}} Paraguayan fort at Curuzú. The operation would be carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of Tamandaré. Porto Alegre not only refused to defer to his cousin, arguing that both held the same rank, but also warned that he would operate by himself at Curuzú. Porto Alegre was incapable of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. Nor was the situation among the allied forces improved once Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa). Jordão was ostracized for supporting Mitre and for {{being a member of}} the Conservative Party, while Porto Alegre and Tamandaré were Progressives.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd {{century was}} the age in which the {{initiative}} for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office.

Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested. There {{is no evidence that}} Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. Pogroms against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor. There is no evidence that Philip punished, participated in or assisted the pogrom.|$|E

5|$|The River Welland {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} on which improvements, in this case to allow {{navigation}} to Stamford, were authorised by an act of Parliament. The act was granted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and the preamble explained how Stamford had prospered {{as a result of the}} river, but also stated that mills built between Stamford and Deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable, as they had diverted the water. Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this. There is no evidence that any work was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> terms of the act.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} encouraged Gaunt {{to further}} expand Dunstanburgh's defences {{over the next}} two years. A wide range of work was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> direction of the constable, Thomas of Ilderton, and the mason Henry of Holme, including blocking up the entrance in the gatehouse {{to turn it into a}} keep. In 1384 a Scottish army attacked the castle but they lacked siege equipment and were unable to take the defences. Gaunt lost interest in the property after he gave up his role as the Lieutenant of the Marches. Dunstanburgh Castle remained part of the Duchy of Lancaster, but the Duchy was annexed to the Crown when Gaunt's son, Henry IV, took the throne of England in 1399.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} {{continued in}} 1942, but were ultimately unsuccessful; the problems posed by impurities in the coke and uranium oxide {{had not been}} fully appreciated, {{and as a result}} too many neutrons were captured. But Laurence's efforts attracted some attention, and in the summer of 1940 he was visited by R. H. Fowler, the British scientific liaison officer in Canada. This was followed by a visit from John Cockcroft of the British Tizard Mission to the United States in the autumn. They brought news of the similar research being carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of the MAUD Committee in Britain and the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in the United States.|$|E

5|$|After {{ending his}} work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his {{attention}} to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near to Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Wheeler, Tessa, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum, Charles Drew, the project was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries. His excavation report was published in 1943 as Maidan Castle, Dorset. The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maidan Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.|$|E
5|$|In February 1892, Sperber {{left for}} another {{overhaul}} in Sydney. While en route, {{she had to}} stop at Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands and send a landing party ashore to punish locals who had attacked German businessmen there. The overhaul lasted from 3 March to 3 May, after which Sperber went on another tour of the islands, including the Marshalls, Butaritari, and Matupit Island. At Matupit the Deputy Chancellor, Georg Schmiele, came aboard the ship. Sperber was back in Apia by 17 May, and she remained there until 1 November, when she left for another tour, which included stops at Nukufetau, Herbertshöhethe capital of German New Guineaand Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. Another period of dockyard work at Sydney followed from 6 February 1893 to 18 April. In the meanwhile, unrest in Samoa broke <b>out,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leadership of King Mata'afa Iosefo. He was arrested, however, which caused the movement to disperse; after she returned from Sydney, Sperber was tasked with taking Mata'afa into exile on Jaluit Atoll.|$|E
