5000|$|... 7-122. GENERAL. The word {{safetying}} {{is a term}} universally used in {{the aircraft}} industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, <b>oil</b> caps, <b>drain</b> cocks, <b>valves,</b> and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R

40|$|The Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project will {{transfer}} metallic SNF {{from the}} Hanford 105 K-East and 105 K-West Basins to safe interim storage in the Canister Storage Building in the 200 Area. The initial basis for design, fabrication, installation, {{and operation of}} the fuel removal systems was that the basin leak rate which could result from a postulated accident condition would not be excessive relative to reasonable recovery operations. However, an additional potential K Basin water leak path is through the K Basin <b>drain</b> <b>valves.</b> Three twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> {{are located in the}} main basin bays along the north wall. Five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> are located in the north and south loadout pits (NLOP and SLOP), the weasel pit, the technical viewing pit, and the discharge chute pit. The sumps containing the valves are filled with concrete which covers the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> body. Visual observations indicate that only the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> and that much less of the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves.</b> It was recognized, however, that damage of the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> bonnet or stem during a seismic initiating event could provide a potential K Basin water leak path. The objectives of this analysis are to: (1) evaluate the likelihood of damaging the three twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> located along the north wall of the main basin and the five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> located in the pits from a seismic initiating event, and (2) determine the likelihood of exceeding a specific consequence (initial leak rate) from a damaged valve. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where each variable is modeled using available information and engineering judgement. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution (probability density function). Uncertainty exists because of the inherent randomness associated with the distribution of values that a variable may assume, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge concerning a variable. Engineering judgement and technical information are used to develop the variable probability density functions, but the bounds of the probability density function are based on physical limitations. The uncertainty, described by probability distributions, is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve'') ...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, <b>oil</b> caps, <b>drain</b> cocks, <b>valves,</b> and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R

The pressure inside the chamber will quickly force all water from the chamber out the <b>drain</b> <b>valve.</b> Lowering the pressure inside the chamber will also force the outer hatch shut again because of greater sea pressure outside the submarine. Then the cycle begins again until everyone has left the submarine.|$|R

25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|R

40|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> {{located in}} the bottom of the K-West Basin South Loadout Pit (SLOP) could provide an {{additional}} leak path from the K Basins if the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> were damaged during construction, installation, or operation of the cask loading system. For the K-West Basin SLOP the immersion pail support structure (IPSS) has already been installed, but the immersion pail has not been installed in the IPSS. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the risk of damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> during the remaining installation activities or operation of the cask loading system. Valve damage, as used in this analysis, does not necessarily imply large amounts of the water will be released quickly from the basin, rather valve damage implies that the valve's integrity has been compromised. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where best engineering judgement is used to represent each variable in the analysis. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution. The uncertainty is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and the risk is expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve''). The total risk is the area under the ''risk curve''. The risk of potentially dropping a cask into or on the IPSS and damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> is approximately 1 x 10 {sup - 4 } to 2 x 10 {sup - 5 } per year. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve is 3 x 10 {sup - 2 } to 6 x 10 {sup - 3 } per year. Both risks are expressed as drain value failure frequencies. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve can be significantly reduced by an impact limiter and/or installing a gating or plate over the area bounded by the back of the IPSS and the wall of the SLOP. With either of these actions there is a 90 percent confidence that the frequency of <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> failure would be less than 1 x 10 {sup - 6 } per year...|$|R

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control <b>valve</b> (three-phase operation), <b>drain</b> <b>valves,</b> block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R

By diminishing the spring force, 30 % reduction of the flow rate has been achieved. It is difficult to get more because of stability reasons.
