5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf conduct heat well. Most <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis was {{the name}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> Star Line packet ship which in 1854 carried the group of {{immigrants}} who were to become the Wends of Texas. At least another eight vessels have carried the name since then.|$|E
5|$|Compression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this {{will increase}} the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

5|$|EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, {{was first}} noticed in 1978 and officially {{described}} in 1980. It consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf and a donor star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours. The white dwarf sucks matter {{from the other}} star onto an accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. Nova Trianguli Australis 2008 was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.|$|E

5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
