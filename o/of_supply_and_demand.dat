25|$|Practical uses <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> {{analysis}} often {{center on}} the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity, represented as shifts in the respective curves.

30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of the edge distributions <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> networks, it was necessary to verify their modularity, in other words, we needed to verify if the networks have sub-networks with a high coefficient of grouping and low connectivity with other sub-networks.

25|$|The {{conventional}} {{economic equilibrium}} model <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by Paul Ormerod {{in his book}} The Death of Economics, which, in turn, was criticized by traditional economists.

After discussing {{the relationships between}} the neoclassical approach (in its more general sense) and the Marshallian approach, it is suggested that Marshall’s position was essentially evolutionary and that this methodological stance is clearly evident in his theory on international trade. In particular, Marshall’s treatment <b>of</b> mutual <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves shows that what he had in mind was actually far removed from the scheme of things in which current academic tradition has incorporated the mutual <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves...|$|R
40|$|Pool {{electricity}} markets are cleared under the strong assumption {{of having a}} perfectly known future; in real life, this is anything but true. The inability to predict the random parameters <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> the <b>demand</b> function introduces risk into the market clearing process. Therefore, the main interest is to minimize such risk {{by means of a}} trade-off of the mean and the variance of the social cost function. This paper considers random variations on the levels and on the slopes <b>of</b> the quadratic <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> functions. Correlation is considered between the corresponding coefficients <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves. By means of the mean-variance Markowitz theory, the risk introduced by these random variations is analyzed. A comprehensive analysis on the effects that the mean-variance Markowitz theory has on the nodal spot prices and on the point-elasticities <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves is made. The non-linear optimization model presented in this paper is validated through a three-, a six-, and a 21 -node system. Mean-variance Markowitz theory Pool electricity market Risk evaluation...|$|R

25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets {{studied in}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand,</b> there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that circumstantial and empirical evidence for the existence <b>of</b> labour <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves is at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence. Because virtually all orthodox models of labour markets, simple and complex, are built upon the foundation stones <b>of</b> labour <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves, these models lack empirically supported foundations. Orthodox labour economists must, therefore, either provide stronger evidence or stop using labour <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> curves as the foundation stones of their models.
