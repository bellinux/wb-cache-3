25|$|White Room: usually as {{themselves}} (Dawn & Jennifer) {{in a white}} living room; Dawn always {{enters with}} an outrageous assertion about herself, while Jennifer usually sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> makes her feel unwelcome.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Nicola packs her suitcases, Ambrose {{returning}} with his father's unpacked suitcase, Dan {{sits at the}} bar with his drink, Charlotte opens a folder at her desk, and Imogen joins Stewart <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> they comfort each other. As Imogen switches off the TV, the play ends.|$|E
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks {{they are in the}} bathroom, and {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> simply urinating {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|She darted {{from him}} into the {{adjoining}} room, <b>and</b> threw herself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> panting <b>and</b> trembling.|$|R
60|$|Derek {{sat down}} again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shiny <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> buried {{his head in his}} hands.|$|R

2500|$|When Justin's mother, Arabella, finally arrives, it {{is without}} her [...] "man-friend" [...] Olaf, who was ditched en route. Very drunk, she {{mistakes}} Paige for Justin's fiancée and says Justin has finally struck gold. When Justin eventually manages {{to point out}} which girl Julie-Ann really is, she says [...] "He's done it again! Another bloody dog." [...] Julie-Ann leaves in tears, Arabella collapses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> the Act closes with Justin cheerfully saying [...] "Soup anyone?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1894–1896 renovations to the Deanery, Lockwood de Forest {{transformed}} the original living room into a study for M. Carey Thomas, {{which came to}} be known as the [...] "Blue Room," [...] referring to the room's dark blue walls. The decoration of the Blue Room was inspired by Japanese art, a departure from the East Indian influence that permeates the majority of de Forest's designs in the Deanery. The celebrated gold designs that de Forest stenciled on the ceiling were reminiscent of Japanese textiles, and the spiked flowers of the Japanese pagoda tree were the model for the stencil designs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> daybed. Throughout the Blue Room a number of small works of art were also on display, including etchings by the nineteenth-century artists James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Charles Méryon, and a fifteenth-century bronze bust of Dante Alighieri.|$|E
2500|$|This {{adds another}} mystery – who did kill Costello? Pippa is helped to lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> Clarissa is {{suddenly}} struck by something Hugo said earlier when {{he stated that}} Sellon's antique shop was called [...] "Sellon and Brown". She remembers the phone call asking for Mrs. Brown and a comment made by Costello to Miss Peake before she showed him from {{the house to the}} effect that he came [...] "to see Mrs. Brown" [...] and she realises that Miss Peake is in fact Mrs. Brown, Sellon's former partner. Clarissa was given the rent of the house cheaply to install another Mrs Brown to lure other fortune hunters who are after Sellon's unknown amazing discovery. She laughs off the apparent danger she put Clarissa in stating that she kept a very close eye on things, such as her being on the scene when Costello was threatening her earlier in the evening.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{dropped back}} <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> covered {{her eyes with}} her hand: then Constance, seeing Fan {{approaching}} her, left the room.|$|R
60|$|Rance {{sat down}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{horsehair}} <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> knitted his brows as though {{determined not to}} omit anything in his narrative.|$|R
60|$|They {{dispersed}} {{about the}} room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of {{a flock of}} white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> <b>and</b> ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.|$|R
60|$|I sat by her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> {{finished}} {{the story of}} the Sicilian lovers.|$|E

60|$|The old woman, {{rising to}} her feet with a low groan, shot all the books she had {{collected}} in her apron <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> room muttering and sighing.|$|R
60|$|With crimson cheeks Carry {{ripped the}} other breadths apart, {{and there were}} the other four bills. Then she slipped down in a little heap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{cushions}} <b>and</b> began to cry--happy tears of relief and gladness.|$|R
60|$|She {{put down}} her book <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> got up, not without a little tremor at this {{unexpected}} encounter.|$|E
60|$|There {{were signs}} of {{unpacking}} about the room-Flora's dressing-case on the table, and some dresses lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> ottoman.|$|E
60|$|He dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} read a novel. I wanted to go, but his mother insisted on my staying.|$|E
60|$|Here {{follows a}} {{dialogue}} (but it requires imitation), which I had yesterday {{morning with a}} little boy of the house--landlord's son, I suppose--about Plorn's age. I am sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> writing, <b>and</b> find him sitting beside me.|$|R
60|$|Ralph took a {{chair at}} some distance; then, another chair a little nearer; then, moved a little nearer still; then, nearer again, and finally sat himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> laid his hand on Kate's arm.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel, {{securing}} the evening paper, retired into a corner. The highly coloured Kite, reaching {{down from the}} mantelpiece a paper fan, held it coyly before her face. Miss Devine sat upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse-hair <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> rearranged her skirts.|$|R
60|$|They had {{not been}} far off. In {{a few more minutes}} Mrs Moss was {{reviving}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> alone with her daughter.|$|E
60|$|For an hour Frank lay sobbing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> then, {{remembering the}} doctor's last words, he knelt beside it {{and prayed for}} strength.|$|E
60|$|Walpole {{raises his}} hand warningly to silence him. Sir Ralph sits down quietly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> frankly buries {{his face in his}} handkerchief.|$|E
6000|$|I {{heard no}} more, felt no more, till I became {{conscious}} that I was lying {{with my head}} low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> Pierre, <b>and</b> my father by my side. As soon as I was thoroughly revived, my father left the room, and presently returned, saying-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he flung}} himself panting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> again, <b>and</b> rasped out the remark, [...] "He arrived {{just at the}} right moment; I was full {{to the brim with}} bitter thinkings, and nobody to take it out of. How {{refreshing}} it was! I feel better." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, well! Dora and I {{were sitting}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> by <b>and</b> by, quiet enough, and Jip {{was lying in}} her lap, winking peacefully at me. It was off my mind. I {{was in a state}} of perfect rapture. Dora and I were engaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out, boys," [...] cried John, leaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> seizing a sword {{which hung}} on a peg just above it.--"Fetch the light." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Mrs. Dobbs Broughton {{had gone down}} into her own drawing-room, had tucked herself up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> <b>and</b> had fallen fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|At times I cast myself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> bury {{my head in}} the cushions. Even then I cannot {{find out}} why I was born.|$|E
60|$|George {{rose and}} offered me the round arm-chair. It {{was the highest}} honour he could do me. He asked me what I would drink. When I refused everything, he sat down heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> frowning, <b>and</b> angrily cudgelling his wits for {{something}} to say—in vain.|$|R
50|$|Political editor Sue Jameson {{presented}} <b>the</b> politics news <b>on</b> Daybreak {{often as}} part of the news updates {{at the top of the}} hour. She also appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Daybreak <b>sofa</b> <b>and</b> went live to Westminster or Downing Street for the Breaking News stories.|$|R
