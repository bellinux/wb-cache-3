5|$|The film {{breaks into}} three {{distinct}} acts. In the first, the former Scientologists describe how they joined Scientology; {{the second act}} recounts the history of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard; and in the final act, the film airs allegations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of church members and misconduct by its leadership, particularly David Miscavige, {{who is accused of}} intimidating, beating, imprisoning, and exploiting subordinates. The film depicts the role played by celebrity members, such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise, through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists.|$|E
5|$|The film deconstructs the church's {{claims by}} {{presenting}} a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, L.

The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.|$|E
5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E

In order {{to answer the}} objectives, this research employed Erikson’s psychosocial theory and <b>the</b> theories <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> by several scholars. This study is a qualitative research employing content analysis method. <b>The</b> data <b>of</b> this research are words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs which are taken from an autobiography entitled Sold which have correlation with <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research. Since this is a qualitative research, the researcher was <b>the</b> primary instrument <b>of</b> this research, while the table sheets were the secondary instruments. The data analysis was conducted through four steps: reading and re- reading, arranging and sorting the categorized data, interpreting, and reporting the findings in the research. In order to obtain trustworthiness, the researcher conducted triangulation. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research show that there are four abuses experienced by Tess: psychological abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and physical <b>abuse.</b> <b>The</b> second finding shows that there are four causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abuses: gender inequality, poverty, abuser’s past experience, and parent’s divorce. The researcher also found that there are four effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abuses: genophobia, juvenile delinquency and adult crime, physical wound in certain area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and difficulties in socializing. Finally, there are four effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> on Tess’ personality development: inferiority, role confusion, isolation, and generativity...|$|R

40|$|Child abuse {{has been}} shown to have a {{detrimental}} effect on <b>the</b> emotion development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child. Due to a history with the parent that includes a high proportion of negative interactions and an impaired parent-child relationship, the child who has been subjected to physical abuse often manifests psychological symptoms. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to investigate}} the effect that treatment aimed at increasing <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> positive interaction in the parent-child relationship had on <b>the</b> emotional status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child. Results showed that parent-child interaction play sessions were effective in increasing positive interaction and decreasing subsequent abusive behavior in the parent-child dyad. Self-reported parental attitudes toward the child became more positive. Treatment did not generalize totally and was not maintained totally during follow-up. The effect that treatment had on <b>the</b> emotional status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child was less clear, although some improvement was noted. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study have important clinical implications for therapists working with abusive parents in terms of providing an effective intervention for treatment of child <b>abuse.</b> Further investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment is warranted. Suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R
25|$|In 1998, ISKCON {{published}} an unusually candid expose detailing widespread physical, emotional {{and sexual abuse}} of children.

25|$|During {{the war in}} Iraq {{that began}} in March 2003, {{personnel}} of the United States Army and the Central Intelligence Agency committed a series of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 45) According {{to social}} learning theory, <b>the</b> physical <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> children emanates from <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> personality, behavioral, and environmental variables. Interest in <b>the</b> possible roles <b>of</b> children in establishing and/or maintaining abusive behavior {{is consistent with}} this multidimensional approach. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> clinical observations, it has been asserted that abusive children may play active roles in provoking anger and <b>abuse.</b> <b>The</b> present investigation was conceived {{in order to help}} to explicate <b>the</b> etiology <b>of</b> abusive behavior by testing hypotheses derived from the social learning/interactional theory of child abuse. This thesis was a partial replication of Revitzer's (1978) investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactions <b>of</b> non-abusive parents to the same stimulus materials. The emotional and evaluative reactions of child protective service workers, along with their proficiency at identification of abused children, were investigated in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a videotape analogue study. An equal number of vignettes of abused and non-abused children performing "positive" and "negative" behaviors were shown to a total of 42 people who worked professionally in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> child <b>abuse.</b> <b>The</b> workers were found to exhibit a significant tendency to rate <b>the</b> children as <b>abused.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> children {{were significantly more likely to}} be correctly identified. There were significant differences in workers' ratings of abused and non-abused children, contingent upon whether they were performing positive or negative behavior. Both positive and negative behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> children were associated with more extreme reactions. <b>The</b> negative behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> children elicited more anger and sympathy, and lower ratings on love and goodness. Surprisingly, <b>the</b> positive behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> children elicited less anger and sympathy, and higher ratings on love and goodness. Consistent with the social learning/interactional view <b>of</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>the</b> child may very well contribute to his/her own abuse. However, having been abused appears to be associated with exemplary behavior, as well as extremely irritating negative behavior...|$|R

25|$|The GCC {{states have}} seen {{many cases of}} brutality, some even {{involving}} senior figures.
