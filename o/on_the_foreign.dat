5|$|Rupert was {{appointed}} to the King's Privy Council in 1662, taking roles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> Affairs Committee, the Admiralty Committee and the Tangier Committee. Accounts vary of Rupert's role in all these committees of government. Samuel Pepys, no friend of Rupert's, sat on the Tangier Committee with him and later declared that all Rupert did was to laugh and swear occasionally: other records, such as those of the Foreign Affairs Committee, show him taking a full and active role in proceedings.|$|E

Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} Prussian {{attempts}} to rid itself of the Teutonic rule were made relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> powers who were {{enemies of the}} Knights. The first one in 1286, {{also known as the}} fourth uprising, depended upon help from the Duke of Rügen, the grandson of Swantopolk. The plot was soon revealed and the Bartians and Pogesanians suffered the consequences. In 1295 the last uprising was limited to Natangia and Sambia and depended upon help from Vytenis, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The rebels captured Bartenstein (Bartoszyce) by surprise and plundered as far as Königsberg, but were never a serious threat. By that time Prussian nobility was already baptized and pro-Teutonic to the extent that peasants killed them first before attacking the Knights.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> policy questions of the day.|$|E

5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$.
