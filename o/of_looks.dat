A car-chase scene using 67 cars closed main thoroughfares (including the Brandenburg Gate) for three weeks. Each day, alternate routes were provided around roads cordoned off for filming. The shooting schedule also included a special appearance by Hrithik Roshan, whose presence was kept under wraps by filmmakers. In December 2010, the Berlin shooting ended.|$|E

25|$|In 2002 and 2010, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged {{separate}} productions as part {{of their}} respective Shakespeare in the Parks seasons. The 2002 version was directed by Michael Collins and transposed the action to a West Indies, nautical setting. Actors were featured in outfits indicative <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> of various Caribbean islands. The 2010 production directed by Jon Ciccarelli was fashioned after the atmosphere of the film The Dark Knight with a palette of reds and blacks and set the action in an urban setting. Lear (Tom Cox) appeared as a head of multi-national conglomerate who divided up his fortune among his socialite daughter Goneril (Brenda Scott), his officious middle daughter Regan (Noelle Fair) and university daughter Cordelia (Emily Best).|$|E
25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{not using}} the sets, the episode did re-use the Borg costumes from First Contact, which McNeill {{described}} as [...] "the scarier Borg" [...] compared to those seen previously in The Next Generation. This caused some problems with filming as an animatronic Borg arm used for the film was malfunctioning, leading to the production being stalled for several hours. For First Contact, the Borg had been re-designed by Michael Westmore and Deborah Everton. The former and his makeup team had worked on {{the look of the}} heads, which included a variety of different Borg appliances which could be mixed and matched to create an ongoing variety <b>of</b> <b>looks.</b> For example, Westmore's colleague Jake Garber had created ten different eye pieces. Everton, meanwhile, created the costumes for the Borg, and wanted them to be more elaborate than in previous appearances. This has been done with a view that individuals should look {{as if they had been}} transformed from the inside out, rather than the other way around.|$|E
500|$|According to Ratner, Myers was not {{comfortable}} with these scenes, as {{he felt it was}} too sexual and inappropriate; he even asked him to cut that particular shot. Madonna on the other hand, thought it was fun and convinced the director to keep it. The video ends with one of Powers' fantasies, him proclaiming [...] "It's good to be me!" [...] as Madonna playfully strokes his cheek. Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] denoted one of the series <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> reinvented by Madonna around that time, and was a [...] "radical" [...] change from the geisha look of her previous video for [...] "Nothing Really Matters", released the same year.

500|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love, Sukumar {{began working}} on , a psychological thriller keeping Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist as he felt that Mahesh had a universal appeal in terms <b>of</b> <b>looks.</b> The incident of a bus driver talking about a young boy who claims that his parents were murdered in that bus was taken as the story's base. He worked on the film's script for two months, and considered it as his dream project. 1: Nenokkadine was released on 10 January 2014 globally and received generally negative reviews from the critics. While Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle opined that Sukumar [...] "fails to deliver" [...] and the story is [...] "run of the mill", Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu stated, [...] "Habitual to watching films that begin with a great premise only {{to fall into the}} commercial trap of force-fit comic situations, it comes as a relief when Sukumar laces the psychological thriller with subtle wit that never takes the focus away from the plot". 1: Nenokkadine collected approximately 289 million worldwide on a budget of 700 million, thus becoming a commercial failure.|$|E

500|$|The {{second volume}} of the manga was {{positively}} reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: [...] "With its second volume the title pushes fully {{into the realm of}} romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back." [...] In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, [...] "The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less." [...] In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, [...] "these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little yuri series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking." ...|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{noted that}} many US {{television}} series are filmed in Vancouver, and it [...] "offers an amazing array <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> and feels and, obviously, a great crew base and everything." [...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the ice room inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like thick sheets of ice. Another notable set featured a giant volume knob which Haller turns to [...] "control {{the volume of the}} voices he hears in his head". This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley". The sequence was filmed at the end of production on the season, and added to the second episode. All of Wylie's sets were built with [...] "external lighting features" [...] that could be controlled from a board, allowing the cinematographers to be flexible with lighting [...] "given that the reality of a location can change drastically depending on our main character’s perceptions and actions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{prominent}} area is Amberes Street, home to Mexico City’s gay community. [...] This {{community was}} established in the 1990s due to the area’s overall tolerance and the fact that police here did not extort members of the gay community. Today, homosexuality on Amberes Streets and the rest of Zona Rosa is fairly open with handholding and kissing among same-sex couples. This has led it to be compared to Barrio de Chueca in Madrid and the Castro District in San Francisco. It is famous for being a gay encounter area, especially for young gay men, with some being minors. The gay community has its own set <b>of</b> <b>looks,</b> body language, phrases and other signals used to identify one another. Another important aspect of the gay culture is clothing, with clothing considered to be in “good taste” making one more successful in meeting potential partners. A number of gay men make money through prostitution, mostly younger men soliciting older men. In 2010, the city opened a consulting office for homosexuals wishing to take advantage of Mexico City’s law allowing them to marry.|$|E

[...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show.
