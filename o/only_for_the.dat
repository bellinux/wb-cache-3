5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most advanced abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), {{making it difficult to}} establish defining features of the skeleton for the family as a whole. However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{decision}} by John, the war with Russia ended in 1583 when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa (Plyussa, Pljussa, Plusa) with Sweden. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purposes of negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{popular culture}} writer Anna Leszkiewicz {{suggested}} {{that even though}} The Simpsons still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal is <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season {{had an average of}} 7.2 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first {{three members of the}} group 12. The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first {{three members of the}} group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had been written in the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Japanese market).

Several of the songs on the album were previously recorded by the band {{in one form or}} another, although most of the songs are completely new material.|$|E

5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} races of {{professional}} road cycling. It was first run in 1896 and has stopped <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two world wars. The race was created by two Roubaix textile manufacturers, Théodore Vienne (born 28 July 1864) and Maurice Perez. They had been behind the building of a velodrome on 46,000 square metres at the corner of the rue Verte and the route d'Hempempont, which opened on 9 June 1895.|$|E
5|$|Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as {{they were}} known in the Scottish Church, {{supervised}} the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie—and these provided the income not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses {{within and outside the}} diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and a small number were held in common. The bishop received mensal and prebendary income in his separate positions as prelate and canon.|$|E
