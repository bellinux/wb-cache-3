40|$|It is {{said that}} Latin America’s misfortune is instability. I believe the opposite. “Next to instability, ” Germán Arciniegas wrote in 1958, “there at times occurs {{something}} worse: stability ” (all translations from Spanish-language material are mine). A word with a double meaning, stability signifies continuity yet also denotes a static or immutable quality. In the two centuries of Latin America’s existence as independent republics, a permanent institutional and political order has followed a path of continuity under the constant swings of {{the present and the}} mirages of turbulent change. At the same time, we Latin Americans have not known how to be unstable where we should be. For this reason, Latin America’s standard of living is one-tenth that of the United States and Canada; one-half of <b>our</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> <b>poor,</b> and one-quarter lives in misery (Sol M. Linowitz Forum 1997). A decade after the poorly named “liberal ” reforms south of the Rio Grande, dismay is spreading from one end of Latin America to another. The developed countries are stable in essential matters and unstable in the rest—perfectly inverse to our own realities. In the United States {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century, railroad stocks, the symbol of heavy industry, were the only stocks that a conservative investor took into account in the so-called blue chips. At the close of the century, with a recorded increase of 26, 130 percent in the Dow Jones index, the stars of the American stock market were companies with no profits, examples being such dissimilar endeavors as Amazon and the Internet Capital Group (Norris 2000). Can there be any greater instability? Yet, thanks to fundamental stability, this transition, a revolution that has changed the symbols of the modern economy, has taken place, transferring Alvaro Vargas Llosa is a writer currently living in Madrid, Spain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Families of {{patients}} admitted {{in the intensive}} care units (ICUs) experience high levels of emotional stress. Access to information about patient's medical conditions and quality relationships with healthcare staff are high priority needs for these families and meeting these needs of the family members is a primary responsibility of ICU physicians and nurses. Methodology Our objectives were to assess the expectations of ICU patients' families that can be fulfilled by physicians and nurses. The design was a descriptive, exploratory questionnaire based study over 6 months in the multidisciplinary ICU of a tertiary care hospital. Results Of 205 interviews, the median age of the patient was 28 years. One hundred and nineteen (58 %) were male and Eighty six (42 %) patients were female. 163 (79. 5 %) of the relatives were Next of kin, and 133 (64. 9 %) were male members. Of the family members, 20 (9. 8 %) were spouses. One hundred and forty two (69. 3 %) belonged to Middle income group. Ninety nine (48. 3 %) were Graduates of high school or above. Relation to patient, sex of relative, DNR status of patient and age of relative were statistically significant to make a difference to the satisfaction score. The majority of the relatives reached a score of 22 - 25. Conclusion We conclude that families of critically ill patients were generally satisfied with communication in the ICU; however, our limitations are the cohort in our urban based tertiary care hospital may not adequately represent the majority of <b>our</b> <b>population</b> which <b>is</b> <b>poor</b> and illiterate and many other factors such as misunderstanding of medical knowledge and a more patriarchal attitude of physicians may affect family needs and satisfaction scores. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. It was {{the aim of}} {{the present}} paper to {{describe}} the nutritional intake, the physical performance capacity and certain anthropometric variables of a group of schoolchildren (n= 297) from 7 to 12 years of age. The findings on this <b>population</b> may <b>be</b> used to give advise in specific marketing situations. Design. The subjects were asked to complete a three day food diary. During a school visit body weight, stature and skinfold thicknesses were measured. Fitness assessment was assessed using items of the Eurofit testbattery. Data analysis was carried out as a function of sex and age groups. Findings. Seventy seven percent of all subjects had a caloric intake below the RDA while 23 % had an intake above the RDA. Macronutrient distribution showed for all groups a low carbohydrate intake, a high fat intake, whilst protein intake was just near the upper limit of the RDA. Flexibility, explosive leg strength, abdominal dynamic muscular endurance and cardiovascular endurance was significantly lower when comparing our data with data of the 1990 ’s. Significant correlations were found between the BMI values and the sum of skinfolds. Value.

40|$|Over two fifths of <b>our</b> <b>population</b> {{appears to}} <b>be</b> <b>poor</b> {{in the sense}} that their basic needs are not met by the {{resources}} at their disposal. This level of pauperism is roughly similar if not higher to what was our experience to begin with, at the time of independence in 1947. During some periods of the Pakistan’s history of over five decades, poverty was brought under some control however. But numbers of <b>poor</b> today <b>are</b> more than the total population in 1947. Emergence of poverty and deprivation in a society or community in general has evoked a response in terms of provisions and transfers as well as modification in growth pursuits to improve the situation. These measures may take variety of forms in terms of institutional structures and organisations. Social Safety Nets (SSN) for instance currently are opted throughout the developing world including Pakistan to address the issues of poverty and deprivation. This study aims at examination of varying levels of poverty overtime and description and evaluation of existing social safety nets. In the first section of this study a brief discussion of inter-temporal poverty profile is made. The nature of SSN currently in vogue will be assessed in the second section of the report, wherein, their coverage, the contents and other qualitative dimensions will be described in detail. In addition, there will be a discussion of private philanthropy and transfers as well as their impact on the well-being of poor. In the concluding section SSN will be assessed with a major focus on highlighting the inadequacies of the existing approaches to alleviate poverty. ...|$|R
