5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an <b>overproduction</b> of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to <b>overproduction</b> of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. <b>Overproduction</b> of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders can result in the <b>overproduction</b> or underproduction of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders can result in the gland's enlargement and cause a swollen neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|Mason avoided overdependence {{on tobacco}} {{as a source}} of income by leasing much of his land {{holdings}} to tenant farmers, and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the British West Indies as Virginia's economy sank because of tobacco <b>overproduction</b> in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia wine industry, subscribing along with other Virginians such as Thomas Jefferson to Philip Mazzei's scheme for growing wine grapes in America.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, <b>overproduction,</b> underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the <b>overproduction</b> of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of <b>overproduction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an <b>overproduction</b> of thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by {{the outset of the}} Depression as <b>overproduction</b> {{depleted}} his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, slaughtering, paper making, machining, and tobacco processing. Other industries including {{the manufacture of}} paint, bricks, and iron. During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the <b>overproduction</b> of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most other industries suffered similar declines.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in <b>overproduction.</b> In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end <b>overproduction</b> and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to {{accelerate}} rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
5|$|Reports from 1983 {{gave way}} to urban legend stating {{that as a result}} of <b>overproduction</b> and returns, {{millions}} of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager who was in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various titles were buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while <b>overproduction</b> is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from <b>overproduction,</b> causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{red blood}} cell mass usually from <b>overproduction</b> by the bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Overproduction,</b> {{attended}} by {{a drop in}} quality control and an exhaustion of overused formulas (Yang, 2003).|$|E
25|$|Hyperuricaemia {{associated}} with classic primary gout, {{which is caused}} by low uric acid renal clearance rather than uric acid <b>overproduction,</b> is not {{associated with}} neuropathology.|$|E
25|$|Loss of the regulator, Pten, of the Phophatidylinositol3’ kinase pathway {{results in}} {{skeletal}} overgrowth and growth plate dysfunction, due to <b>overproduction</b> {{of the matrix}} and accelerated hypertrophic differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Medication {{to reduce}} {{production}} of hair is currently under testing. One medicinal option suppresses testosterone {{by increasing the}} sex hormone-binding globulin. Another controls the <b>overproduction</b> of hair through the regulation of a luteinizing hormone.|$|E
25|$|Some {{analysts have}} speculated that one of Saddam Hussein's main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait for not {{stopping}} its policy of <b>overproduction,</b> {{as well as his}} reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of the endocannabinoid system {{in the development of}} metabolic syndrome is indisputable. Endocannabinoid <b>overproduction</b> may induce reward system dysfunction and cause executive dysfunctions (e.g., impaired delay discounting), in turn perpetuating unhealthy behaviors. The brain is crucial in development of metabolic syndrome, modulating peripheral carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{mutations}} of HPRT are known. Mutations that only mildly decrease the enzyme's function do not normally cause the severe form of LNS, but do produce a milder form of the disease which still features purine <b>overproduction</b> accompanied by susceptibility to gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Kuwait {{had been}} {{producing}} oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By {{the eve of}} the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti <b>overproduction</b> had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Primary aldosteronism, {{also known}} as primary hyperaldosteronism, is {{characterized}} by the <b>overproduction</b> of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, when not a result of excessive renin secretion. It leads to arterial hypertension (high blood pressure) associated with hypokalemia, usually a diagnostic clue. Secondary hyperaldosteronism, on the other hand, is due to overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system.|$|E
25|$|Despite the inefficient {{production}} of aldosterone, the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11β-OH CAH is hypertension. Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme <b>overproduction</b> of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid, but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess: salt retention, volume expansion, and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{symptoms}} of the disease {{is the presence of}} sand-like crystals of uric acid in the diapers of the affected infant. <b>Overproduction</b> of uric acid may lead to the development of uric acid crystals or stones in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Such crystals deposited in joints later in the disease may produce gout-like arthritis, with swelling and tenderness.|$|E
25|$|Another sign of Graves' {{disease is}} hyperthyroidism, i.e., <b>overproduction</b> of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and {{occasionally}} also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though {{it is not}} the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.|$|E
25|$|China, due {{in large}} part to {{environmental}} concerns, has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut <b>overproduction.</b> According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.|$|E
25|$|About two {{to three}} people per million are {{affected}} each year. It most commonly affects people who are 20 to 50 years of age. Women are affected three times more often than men. A mild degree of <b>overproduction</b> of cortisol without obvious symptoms, however, is more common. Cushing's syndrome was first described by Harvey Cushing in 1932. Cushing's syndrome may also occur in other animals including cats, dogs, and horses.|$|E
25|$|However, {{toward the}} end of the war, the {{prospects}} of an Anglo-American front against the Soviet Union seemed slim from Stalin's standpoint. At the end of the war, Stalin assumed that the capitalist camp would resume its internal rivalry over colonies and trade, giving opportunity for renewed expansion at a later date, rather than pose a threat to the USSR. Stalin expected the United States to bow to domestic popular pressure for postwar demilitarization. Soviet economic advisors such as Eugen Varga predicted that the U.S. would cut military expenditures, and therefore suffer a crisis of <b>overproduction,</b> culminating in another great depression. Based on Varga's analysis, Stalin assumed that the Americans would offer the Soviets aid in postwar reconstruction, needing to find any outlet for massive capital investments in order to sustain the wartime industrial production that had brought the U.S. out of the Great Depression. However, to the surprise of Soviet leaders, the U.S. did not suffer a severe postwar crisis of <b>overproduction.</b> As Stalin had not anticipated, capital investments in industry were sustained by maintaining roughly the same levels of government spending.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the crisis}} was {{perceived}} as a problem of <b>overproduction.</b> Consequently, the German film industry cut back on production. 123 German movies were produced in 1955, only 65 in 1965. However, many German film companies followed the 1960s trends of international co-productions with Italy and Spain in such genres as spaghetti westerns and Eurospy films with films shot in those nations or in Yugoslavia that featured German actors in the casts.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, class IB reductases are not {{inhibited}} by dATP {{because they}} lack approximately 50 N-terminal amino acids required for the allosteric activity site. Eukaryotic cells with class IA reductases have a mechanism of negative control to turn off synthesis of dNTPs as they accumulate. This mechanism protects the cell from toxic and mutagenic effects that can arise from the <b>overproduction</b> of dNTPs because changes in balanced dNTP pools lead to DNA damage and cell death.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and {{the passage of}} the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) appeared to change things. The NIRA, which Roosevelt signed in June 1933, called for cooperation among business, labor and government and established the National Recovery Administration (NRA). It was to oversee the creation of codes of conduct for particular industries that would reduce <b>overproduction,</b> raise wages, control hours of work, guarantee the rights of workers to form unions, and stimulate an economic recovery.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{cortisol}} level can {{be explained}} by the strong negative feedback mechanism of cortisol on hypothalamus-pituitary axis system. That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more cortisol. However, the initial excess of cortisol is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism—high cortisol decreases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid <b>overproduction.</b> Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
