5|$|Hyderabadi haleem is {{regarded}} as an international delicacy. In Hyderabad, the dish is often consumed at celebratory events such as weddings. It is consumed especially during Iftaar, the evening meal following the day-long fast, observed by Muslims during the month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music is}} {{prohibited}} from being played inside mosques and during Islamic rites/observances/holidays, {{such as the}} fasting month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan,</b> where playing is only allowed at night when people are allowed to eat after Iftar.

5|$|A small hill {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River. Because of its {{strategic}} location, it {{was used as a}} fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, a graveyard, and monuments can be found on top of the hill. During the Islamic holy month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan,</b> a century-old brass bell known as genta will be rung to signify that it is time for iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan,</b> the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Ka'ak bi 'awja is a {{semolina}} shortbread pastry {{filled with}} ground dates called ajwa or walnuts. The dessert {{is a traditional}} meal for Christians during Easter, however, ka'ak bi awja is also prepared towards the end <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan,</b> to be eaten during Eid al-Fitr—a Muslim festival immediately following Ramadan, as well as during Eid al-Adha. During Mawlid—the holiday honoring {{the birth of the}} Islamic prophet Muhammad—Zalabieh which consists of small, crunchy deep fried dough balls in dipped in syrup, is served. The dough is made from flour, yeast and water.|$|E
40|$|Our {{starting}} point for this assignment was to investigate if {{it is possible to}} unite Muslim values in a European society? We choose to go into the two books, <b>of</b> respectively Tariq <b>Ramadan</b> and Safet Bektovic. They are both faithful Muslims, who are trying to present the problems which arise in the meeting of cultures. To begin with we made a summary <b>of</b> <b>Ramadans</b> point <b>of</b> view, and a following analysis of argument; then we selected a piece of text, which we made a close-up analysis of. Furthermore we have made a summary of which subjects Bektovic treats in his book, and in the end we compare the two books...|$|R

5|$|The {{preparation}} of haleem {{has been compared}} to that of Hyderabadi biryani. Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high in calories. This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan. In recognition of its cultural significance and popularity, in 2010, it was granted Geographical Indication status (GIS) by the Indian GIS registry office, making it the first non-vegetarian dish in India to get this status.|$|E
5|$|Abu Hurairah {{said that}} the Prophet said: There will be an Ayah (sign) in (the month <b>of)</b> <b>Ramadan.</b> Then, there will 'isabah (splitting into groups) in Shawwal. Then, there will be {{fighting}} in (the month of) Dhu al-Qi'dah. Then, the pilgrim will be robbed in (the month of) Dhu al-Hijjah. Then, the prohibitions will be violated in (the month of) al-Muharram. Then, there will be sound in (the month of) Safar, then the tribes will conflict {{with each other in}} the two months of Rabi' al-awwal & Rabi' al-thani.

5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan.</b> Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E

5|$|Rising {{property}} prices in Surrey in the 1940s and 1950s made the LNC increasingly valuable, but {{also made it}} a target for property speculators. In 1959 a hostile takeover succeeded, and LNC's independence came to an end. From 1959 to 1985 a succession of owners stripped the profitable parts of the business from the company, leaving a rump residual company operating the increasingly derelict cemetery. In 1985 {{what remained of the}} company came into the ownership <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> Güney, who set about reviving what remained. Links were formed with London's Muslim communities in an effort to encourage new burials, and a slow programme of clearing and restoring the derelict sections of the cemetery commenced. Although it was never as successful as planned, the LNC was very influential on both the funeral industry and the development of the area around Woking, and Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Karim Benzema {{was born}} in the city of Lyon, France to French {{nationals}} of Algerian descent. As a practicing Muslim, he observes fasting during the Islamic holy month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan.</b> His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Beni Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s. Benzema's father, Hafid, {{was born in}} Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, {{was born and raised in}} Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon. His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers. The former currently plies his trade at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron. Since establishing himself as an international footballer, Benzema has been involved in numerous promotional campaigns. Since 2008, he has regularly appeared on the cover of the French version of the annual FIFA video game. Benzema is sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas and has, subsequently, appeared in several television advertisements for the brand.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun {{was born}} on the 23rd day of the month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> 220 AH (20 September 835) or {{slightly}} later, probably in Baghdad. His father, Tulun, was a Turk from a locality known in Arabic sources as Tagharghar or Toghuzghuz, i.e. the Uyghur confederation. In the year 815/6 (200 AH) Tulun was taken captive along with other Turks, and sent {{as part of the}} tribute of the Samanid governor of Bukhara Nuh ibn Asad to the Caliph al-Ma'mun (reigned 813–833), who at the time resided in Khurasan. After al-Ma'mun returned to Baghdad in 819, these Turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers (ghilmān, sing. ghulām) entrusted to al-Ma'mun's brother and eventual successor, al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842). Tulun did well for himself, eventually coming to command the Caliph's private guard. Ahmad's mother, called Qasim, was one of his father's slaves. In 854/5, Tulun died, and Qasim is commonly held to have married a second time, to the Turkish general Bayakbak or Bakbak. This report, however, does not appear in Ibn al-Daya or al-Balawi, and may be spurious. According to al-Balawi, after his father's death Ahmad came under the tutelage of Yalbakh, a close companion of Tulun, who had been taken captive alongside him. At his deathbed, Tulun urged his friend {{to take care of his}} wife and son, and Bakbak thereafter treated the young Ahmad as his own son.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month <b>of</b> <b>Ramadan</b> in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
