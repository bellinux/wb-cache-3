5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face <b>of</b> <b>tragedy</b> and loss.|$|E

Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter {{the top of the}} fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the Hag 1 along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that everyone else has celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.|$|E
25|$|Fielding gives special {{emphasis}} to the printed version <b>of</b> The <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies</b> by including notes {{and making it}} his only printed play that originally includes a frontispiece. The variorum, or notes, to the printed version of the play pointed out many of the parodies, allusions, and other references within The <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies.</b> However, the notes themselves serve as a parody for serious uses of the notes and mock the idea of critically interpreting plays. By calling himself Scriblerus Secundus, Fielding connects The <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies</b> with {{the works of the}} Scriblerus Club. These works also contain parodies of critics and scholars who attempt to elucidate literature.|$|R

In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.|$|E

25|$|Dionysus has {{remained}} {{an inspiration to}} artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth <b>of</b> <b>Tragedy</b> (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. Nietzsche claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based on suffering of Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later works The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is conceived {{as the embodiment of}} the unrestrained will to power.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-16th century, {{the works}} of Seneca were rediscovered by Italian humanists, and they became the models for the revival <b>of</b> <b>tragedy.</b> Seneca's {{influence}} is particularly evident in Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Shakespeare's Hamlet, both of which share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and ghosts among the cast. The ghosts in Richard III also resemble the Senecan model, while the ghost in Hamlet plays a more complex role. The shade of Hamlet's murdered father in Hamlet {{has become one of}} the more recognizable ghosts in English literature.
