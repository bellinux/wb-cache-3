25|$|However, much {{empirical}} {{research in the}} field of happiness economics, such as that by Benjamin Radcliff, professor <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Science</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E

25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general {{would have had to}} consider carefully the reasonableness of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary democracy and a dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are not healthy for the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E

He assumed responsibility for UCI's fledgling graduate program, and {{over a number of}} years turned it into a dynamic and comprehensive program which equipped them to attract first-rate students. Inter alia this involved a compulsory course for new graduate students, which dealt with 19th and 20th century foundations of modern political science.|$|E

25|$|In the {{intended}} third volume of The Life of Mind, Arendt {{was planning to}} engage the faculty of judgment {{but she did not}} live to write it. Nevertheless, although her notion of judging remains unknown, Arendt did leave manuscripts (such as Thinking and Moral Considerations and Some Questions on Moral Philosophy) and lectures (Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy) concerning her thoughts on this mental faculty. The first two articles were edited and published by Jerome Kohn, an assistant of Arendt and a director of the Hannah Arendt Center at The New School in New York, and the last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Toronto. Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, ephemera, and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment. The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.|$|E
500|$|During the {{apartheid}} era, the Afrikaners dominated {{in number of}} voters, politics and civil service, while English-speaking white South Africans dominated economically. The Afrikaners separated themselves {{from the rest of}} the population, both black people and English-speaking whites. In 1971 sociologist Heribert Adam writes [...] "the historical friction between the English and Afrikaans-speaking populace is gradually being replaced by class contradictions within the two groups." [...] Historical friction was revived and exploited by the ruling National Party for political gain however. In 1973 Edward Feit, professor <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>science</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Michigan, writes in the American Journal of Sociology: [...] "Recent political campaigns have shown that the old bogey of Boerehaat still has its charms for an Afrikaaner majority." ...|$|E
