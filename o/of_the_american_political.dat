25|$|Although his {{presidency}} was initially regarded fairly poorly, now, two decades later, {{there is a}} consensus {{across much of the}} political spectrum that Bush was a president of some consequence, a man of conscience and reason, a steady hand at a time of geopolitical instability.

25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Political</b> Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, so it might better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social and political problems revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation that grew out of a deep discontent with the direction of contemporary political research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on contemporary political problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct de-emphasis of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Public {{opinion on}} the One-China Policy is much more {{ambiguous}} than the opinions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts {{believe it to be}} very important to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, where as only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement . This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and the American Public has been translated into recent politics; Donald Trumps phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades old policy, possibly representing an expression of current polling showing negative attitudes towards The Peoples Republic of China. Furthermore, U.S. populist attitudes towards the Peoples Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious. Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.|$|E

In a September 2010 {{survey by the}} United States Presidency Centre of the Institute for the Study of the Americas at the University of London School of Advanced Study—one year and eight months into the Obama presidency—47 unnamed respondents who were U.K. academic specialists on American history and politics ranked 40 of 42 U.S. presidents from 1789 to 2009, not including Obama; if Obama had been included he would have ranked 8th, behind Harry S. Truman but ahead of Ronald Reagan and all other post-World War II U.S. presidents. In a June 2012 survey by Newsweek magazine—three years and five months into the Obama presidency—ten selected American historians and biographers ranked Obama 10th of 20 U.S. presidents since 1900. In an April 2013 survey by History News Network (HNN) website in Seattle—four years and three months into the Obama presidency—203 scholars from 69 top U.S. colleges and universities gave Obama a B- grade on an A–F scale. A February 2015 Brookings Institution survey of members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Political</b> Science Association put Obama in 18th place out of the 43 presidents.
