The {{response}} of mature female captive milkfish to mammalian and salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (mGnRH-A and sGnRH-A) was investigated. Prior to spawning, six {{groups of three}} females received (1) 10 â€“ 16 Î¼g mGnRH-A from an <b>osmotic</b> pump <b>implanted</b> intraperitoneally (IP); (2) 100 Î¼g mGnRH-A from a cholesterol/cellulose pellet implanted IP; (3) 10 Î¼g/kg mGnRH-A as an intramuscular (IM) injection; (4) 10 â€“ 16 Î¼g sGnRH-A from an <b>osmotic</b> pump <b>implanted</b> IP; (5) 100 Î¼g sGnRH-A from a cholesterol/cellulose pellet implanted IP, and (6) a cholesterol/cellulose pellet without analogue implanted IP. The most effective treatment was 100 Î¼g sGnRH-A/fish given in a cholesterol/cellulose pellet; all (3 / 3) of the fish spawned. However, mGnRH-A was more effective (2 / 3) compared with sGnRH-A (1 / 3) if osmotic pumps were used to administer GnRH-A. If the dose and method of administration were not considered, then the salmon and mammalian GnRH analogues were equally effective (62 â€“ 67 %) for induction of ovulation and natural spawning in milkfish. Gonads of control fish regressed. At the doses tested, injections or pellet implantations were more effective compared with osmotic pumps. All pellet-implanted and injected females responded to treatment and 75 % (6 / 8) spawned; half (3 / 6) of the pump-implanted females spawned. Spawning occurred from 18 to 36 h after treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Leptin {{therapy has}} been found to reverse {{hyperglycemia}} and prevent mortality in several rodent models of type 1 diabetes. Yet the mechanism of leptin-mediated reversal of hyperglycemia has not been fully defined. The liver is a key organ regulating glucose metabolism and is also a target of leptin action. Thus we hypothesized that exogenous leptin administered to mice with streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetes reverses hyperglycemia through direct action on hepatocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—After the induction of diabetes in mice with a high dose of STZ, recombinant mouse leptin was delivered at a supraphysiological dose for 14 days by an <b>osmotic</b> pump <b>implant.</b> We characterized the effect of leptin administration in C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice with STZ-induced diabetes and then examined whether leptin therapy could reverse STZ-induced hyperglycemia in mice in which hepatic leptin signaling wa...|$|R

40|$|When {{skeletal}} muscle is injured, mononuclear muscle precursors, the satellite cells, are activated {{and begin to}} proliferate and then fuse {{with each other to}} form new multinucleated myotubes, which eventually become the mature muscle fibres. The process of muscle regeneration is regulated by locally produced growth factors that control cellular proliferation and differentiation. Several polypeptide growth factors have been implicated as regulators of myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation during development and after injury. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), are five cytokines which strongly stimulate the proliferation of muscle myoblasts in vitro, with LIF being the most effective. These actions suggest that they have a regulatory role in the development and regeneration of muscle. The muscle crush model in mice was used to test the effects of these factors in muscle regeneration.

The presence of liver metastases was checked by laparotomy 14 days after tumor-cell injection. Evaluable rats were assigned randomly to 5 experimental groups designated as control, 5 -FU, IL- 2, 5 -FU/IL- 2 and 5 -FU/T alpha 1 /IL- 2. 5 -FU was administered i. v. as a continuous infusion for 7 days by an <b>osmotic</b> device <b>implanted</b> surgically.

Although there was an overall tendency to a lower rate of glucose utilization (by 6 %) in the nicotine-treated animals compared to the controls receiving saline only, the difference was not statistically significant.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are widely used to relieve pain, but the effects of long-term usage on macrophage function remain to be elucidated. Using bone marrow-derived macrophage culture and long-term COX inhibitor treatments in BALB/c mice and zebrafish, we showed that chronic COX inhibition drives macrophages into an inflammatory state. Macrophages differentiated in the presence of SC- 560 (COX- 1 inhibitor), NS- 398 (COX- 2 inhibitor) or indomethacin (COX- 1 / 2 inhibitor) for 7 days produced more TNFα or IL- 12 p 70 with enhanced p 65 /IκB phosphoylation. YmI and IRF 4 expression was reduced significantly, indicative of a more inflammatory phenotype. We further observed that indomethacin or NS- 398 delivery accelerated zebrafish death rates during LPS induced sepsis. When COX inhibitors were released over 30 days from an <b>osmotic</b> pump <b>implant</b> in mice, macrophages from peritoneal cavities and adipose tissue produced more TNFα in both the basal state and under LPS stimulation.

The factors mediating EE effects on visual cortical development and plasticity are still unclear. We have investigated whether IGF- 1 is involved in mediating EE effects on the developing visual cortex. We show that EE increases the number of IGF- 1 positive neurons in the visual cortex at P 18. Increasing IGF- 1 in the visual cortex of non-EE rats by means of <b>osmotic</b> minipumps <b>implanted</b> at P 18 mimics EE effects, accelerating visual acuity development, assessed with Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs).

In adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the cerebrovascular autoregulatory curve is shifted to the right, {{in the direction of}} higher blood pressures, an indication of excessive cerebrovascular vasoconstriction. A restricted capacity to dilate cerebral blood vessels may be responsible for the enhanced vulnerability to cerebrovascular ischaemia during hypertension. We found that chronic treatment with the AT 1 -receptor antagonist, candesartan, (0. 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days, via <b>osmotic</b> minipumps <b>implanted</b> in the subcutaneous tissue) blocked Ang II binding to AT 1 -receptors in cerebral blood vessels and in brain areas involved in the regulation of cerebrovascular flow, and increased the ratio of lumen-wall area in the middle cerebral artery.

The mean cross-sectional area of collagen fibers was smaller in specimens from treated mice, but no difference was seen in the size of collagen fibrils. The time required to obtain full skin closure was also delayed 20 %– 27 % in treated animals. Using this injury model, we also found that rMuIFN-γ significantly reduced the degree of perilesional erythema surrounding the laser injury sites and, in the first 6 d after wounding, the degree of polymorphonuclear infiltrate present histologically at lesional sites. Indeed, rMuINF-γ also decreased the cutaneous accumulation of neutrophils induced by known proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin 1 and activated serum. Thus, systemically administered IFN-γ not only down-regulates collagen synthesis in the skin but also modulates in a previously unrecognized manner: neutrophil accumulation at sites of tissue injury in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In most bird species, {{the timing}} of {{incubation}} onset may influence the degree of hatching asynchrony, which, together with variation in clutch size, affects reproductive success. In some domesticated species that usually show no hatching asynchrony, plasma prolactin concentrations in females rise {{with the onset of}} incubation and the end of laying, and this rise enhances incubation behavior and may terminate laying. To investigate whether a rise in prolactin during laying is involved in the regulation of clutch size and incubation onset in a species with hatching asynchrony, we measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive prolactin (ir-prolactin) in laying American kestrels, Falco sparverius, and quantified clutch size and incubation behavior. In a separate study, we administered one of three concentrations of ovine prolactin (o-prolactin) via <b>osmotic</b> pumps <b>implanted</b> in females when egg 2 of a clutch was laid. ir-Prolactin concentrations during laying were higher in small than in large clutches and increased in parallel with the development of incubation behavior. o-Prolactin treatment enhanced incubation behavior, but did not affect clutch size, possibly because the manipulation was performed after clutch size had already been determined. Consistent with studies on domesticated species that show synchronous hatching, our results indicate that rising prolactin during laying enhances the expression of incubation behavior in a species that shows hatching asynchrony. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the relationship between prolactin and clutch size in the American kestrel is one of causation or of mere association. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: egg laying, Falco sparverius, family planning, hatching asynchrony, optimal reproductive tactic, reproductive success. 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

40|$|Here we {{describe}} quantitatively the {{birth and death}} of the two separate populations of neurons, ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells, in the mouse retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL). The two cell types, which are roughly equally numerous, were distinguished pre- and postnatally by labeling the ganglion cells retrogradely with fluorescent dye. Embryos were labeled cumulatively with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) delivered by an <b>osmotic</b> minipump <b>implanted</b> in the mother; cell birth dates were established as having occurred before or after pump implantation. Early cohorts (GCL cells born before embryonic day [E] 11. 8 and E 12. 8) were 98 ± 1. 1 % and 99 ± 0. 2 % ganglion cells (mean ± SEM), respectively, and a late cohort (born after E 15. 8) was 97 ± 1. 2 % displaced amacrines. Thus birth date was a strong predictor of a GCL cell's ultimate identity. Cell death in each cohort was estimated by counting cells at different time points (soon after the cohort was produced and later) and subtracting the later from the earlier number. This method avoids the problem of simultaneous birth and death that has plagued many of the earlier attempts to assess cell death. Negligible numbers died {{during the first week}} after a cell's birthday. The amount of cell death differed in the two cohorts; 48. 5 ± 15 % and 29. 0 ± 12. 4 % in early and late, respectively, and most of it was postnatal. These findings disagree sharply with an earlier conclusion that ganglion cells die within 5 days of their birthdays or not at all. J. Comp.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} range of doses of chronic nicotine (0. 75, 1. 5, 3. 0 and 30. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1, s. c., 14 days) upon striatal dopaminergic nerve terminal survival following 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA; 10 [*]μg intrastriatal unilaterally) in rats; and the effects of acute nicotine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) pretreatment upon striatal neurodegeneration induced by methamphetamine (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., three doses at 2 [*]h intervals) in wild-type and α 4 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subunit knockout mice. In both models of Parkinsonian-like damage, loss of striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals was assessed by [3 H]-mazindol autoradiography. In rats, chronic nicotine infusion delivered by <b>osmotic</b> minipump <b>implanted</b> subcutaneously 7 days prior to intrastriatal 6 -OHDA injection produced significant and dose-related protection against 6 -OHDA-induced neurodegeneration. Low (0. 75 and 1. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1) but not high (3. 0 and 30. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1) nicotine doses significantly inhibited 6 -OHDA-induced degeneration. In wild-type mice, acute nicotine treatment produced significant inhibition of methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration. In α 4 nAChR subunit knockout mice, acute nicotine treatment failed to inhibit methamphetamine-induced neurodegeneration. Nicotine is capable of protecting dopaminergic neurons against Parkinsonian-like neurodegeneration in vivo. In rats, this neuroprotective effect is critically dependent upon nicotine dose and is consistent with the activation of nAChRs, as high, desensitizing doses of nicotine fail to be neuroprotective. Further, neuroprotection is absent in α 4 nAChR subunit knockout mice. The current results therefore suggest that activation of α 4 subunit containing nAChRs constitutes a major component of the neuroprotective effect of nicotine upon Parkinsonian-like damage in vivo...|$|R

40|$|PMCID: PMC 4255926 Background: Progesterone is neuroprotective in {{numerous}} preclinical CNS injury models including cerebral ischaemia. The {{aim of this}} study was two-fold; firstly, we aimed to determine whether progesterone delivery via osmotic mini-pump would confer neuroprotective effects and whether such neuroprotection could be produced in co-morbid animals. Results: Animals underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. At the onset of reperfusion, mice were injected intraperitoneally with progesterone (8 mg/kg in dimethylsulfoxide). Adult and aged C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were dosed additionally with subcutaneous infusion (1. 0 μl/h of a 50 mg/ml progesterone solution) via <b>implanted</b> <b>osmotic</b> minipumps. Mice were allowed to survive for up to 7 days post-ischaemia and assessed for general well-being (mass loss and survival), neurological score, foot fault and t-maze performance. Progesterone reduced neurological deficit [F(1, 2) = 5. 38, P = 0. 027] and number of contralateral foot-faults [F(1, 2) = 7. 36, P = 0. 0108] in adult, but not aged animals, following ischaemia. In hypertensive animals, progesterone treatment lowered neurological deficit [F(1, 6) = 18. 31, P = 0. 0001], reduced contralateral/ipsilateral alternation ratio...|$|R
