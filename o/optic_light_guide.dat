40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of conversion and hardness of different composite resins, photo-activated for 40 s with two different light guide tips, fiber optic and polymer. Methods: Five specimens were made for each group evaluated. The percentage of unreacted carbon double bonds (% C=C) was determined from the ratio of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1637 cm- 1) against internal standard before and after curing of the specimen: aromatic C-C (peak at 1610 cm- 1). The Vickers hardness measurements were performed in a universal testing machine. A 50 gf load was used and the indenter with a dwell time of 30 seconds. The degree of conversion and hardness mean values were analyzed separately by ANOVA and Tukey's test, with a significance level set at 5 %. Results: The mean values of degree of conversion for the polymer and fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> tip were statistically different (P<. 001). The hardness mean values were statistically different among the light guide tips (P<. 001), but also there was difference between top and bottom surfaces (P<. 001).

Using the discharge detection sys-tern, investigations {{have been carried}} out to study the influence of various experimental parambters on the amount of detected corona light.

It is further shown that addition of nitrogen to SF 6 significantly improves the corona light emission.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the compressive strength of microhybrid (FiltekTM Z 250) and nanofilled (FiltekTM Supreme XT) composite resins photo-activated with two different <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> tips, fiber <b>optic</b> and polymer, coupled with one LED. The power density was 653 mW cm− 2 when using the fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> tip and 596 mW cm− 2 with the polymer. After storage in distilled water at 37 ± 2 "C for seven days, the samples were subjected to mechanical testing of compressive strength in an EMIC universal mechanical testing machine with a load cell of 5 kN and speed of 0. 5 mm min− 1. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with a confidence interval of 95 % and Tamhane’s test. The results showed that the mean values of compressive strength were not influenced by the different light tips (p > 0. 05). However, a statistical difference was observed (p < 0. 001) between the microhybrid composite resin photo-activated with the fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> tip and the nanofilled composite resin. Based on these results, it can be concluded that microhybrid composite resin photo-activated with the fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> tip showed better results than nanofilled, regardless of the tip used, and the type of the light tip did not influence the compressive strength of either composite. Thus, the presented results suggest that both the fiber <b>optic</b> and polymer <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> tips provide adequate compressive strength to be used to make restorations.

40|$|THESIS 8600 The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate the efficiency of the overlapping irradiation regime for resin-based composites (RBCs) in ISO 4049 by modifying the irradiation protocol. To exacerbate the potential for uncontrolled initiation on polymerisation and decrease the homogeneity of polymerisation {{along the length of the}} specimen, the exit window was moved by three-quarters (not half) the diameter along the top surface only so that some areas received twice the irradiation of adjacent areas. It was proposed that increasing the number of irradiations, with decreasing tip diameter from 13 to 11 and 8 mm, would progressively decrease the efficiency of the polymerisation process compared with a ?one-hit? irradiation using a 25 mm custom made fibre <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> Additionally, the influence of light irradiation variables (tip diameter, irradiance, irradiation protocol and LCU) on the flexural strength, flexural modulus and the Vickers hardness were assessed. Within the limitations of the experiment tip diameter, irradiance and irradiation protocol had no influence on three-point flexural strength and modulus data. An increase in irradiance for a constant irradiation time resulted in an increase in the Vickers hardness of the bottom surfaces. The study emphasised that the relationship between the development of mechanical properties with energy density is not linear although some clinical implications were highlighted. The {{objective of}} Part II of the current study was to investigate RBC placement variables (principally irradiation distance) which has implications for strength and modulus development in clinical practice.

Photochemical infarction was induced {{using the method}} originally established by Watson et al. (Watson et al. 1985). This method has been widely adopted {{because it does not}} require a craniotomy. Rose bengal is a photosensitive dye, which activates platelets under irradiation by a green beam of light, resulting in localized thrombosis. Rose bengal was injected intravenously (20  mg/kg), and the sensorimotor area of the cerebral cortex was irradiated transcranially for 20  min. Irradiation was performed using green light (533 -nm wavelength) and a fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> of 10  mm diameter (MHF-G 150 LR, MSG 10 - 1100 S; Moritex, Tokyo) (Horinouchi et al. 2007 Ohwatashi et al. 2013). Animals were subsequently divided into 3 groups. In the simple-walking exercise group, animals walked on a treadmill at a rate of 8  m/min for 20  min per day. As expected for acquisition movement exercise group, animals were walked across an elevated narrow beam (122  cm long × 2.5  cm wide) for 20  min every day. Control animals were allowed to move about freely. The locomotion of infarcted rats was evaluated using the same beam-walking task mentioned above. Locomotor performance was quantified as a functional recovery score. Feeney’s assay is used for many studies. Former studies indicated the functional ceiling is obtained untill 14  days from infarction and normal control showed score 7 (Feeney et al. 1982 Abo et al. 2001). Two weeks after infarction, animals were perfused transcardially with 300  mL of 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1  M phosphate buffer at pH  7.4 under deep anesthesia. The brains were removed and postfixed in the perfusion solution overnight, and the infarct surface area (mean[*]±[*]standard deviation) was measured.

40|$|A plastic {{scintillation}} detector exhibiting minimum interference using two different optical fibre light guides have been designed, constructed and evaluated for dosimetry (potentially in-vivo) {{of the high}} energy beams used in radiotherapy practice. One detector system contains the radiation resistant SiO 2 optical fibre, while the other contains PMMA fibre, which has less resistance to radiation. Each fibre is connected to an independent photo diode. Also, each fibre is connected to a cylindrical water equivalent scintillator measuring 3 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. The scintillator is coated with a thin, optically reflective coating. The light arising from the scintillator is transmitted by the fibre <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> and is detected at the photodiode. Each fibre has its own focusing and optical filtering techniques based on the fibre acceptance angle, so the photodiode for SiO 2 and PMMA are the same. The photodiodes are connected to an electronics box with a digital integrator and counting system. The interference radiation could be minimised using inherent optical filtration and digital integration consistent with pulses from the linear accelerator, thereby avoiding {{the use of a}} second optical fibre to compensate for background signals. The SiO 2 and PMMA fibre light guides have different properties especially with respect to flexibility. The dose distribution in water of each fibre light guide coupled scintillator is measured and shows good agreement with ionisation chamber results. Spatial resolution and water equivalence are the most important properties of miniature scintillator detectors. It is shown that these systems are not energy dependent, they do not disturb the main radiation beam, are independent of beam angle and have very good linearity with dose. The current study may stimulate the use of SiO 2 and PMMA fibre coupled plastic {{scintillation detector}}s in medical dosimetry applications.

40|$|A {{membrane}} chemiluminescent assay {{was developed}} for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus. This one step liquid phase immuno-recognition procedure was achieved by incubating samples containing S. aureus cells with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled monoclonal antibody, followed by recovery of the cells on a membrane, and measurement of the HRP catalyzed chemiluminescent signal on the membrane surface with a luminometer. Optimum pH, antibody binding temperature and time, and sensitivity of the assay were determined. The optimum pH for the chemiluminescent reaction was at 8. 5. No {{significant difference was found}} between ambient temperature (22 °C– 25 °C) and 37 °C incubation. Binding time of 60 min had a higher signal than 10 or 20 min. Chemiluminescent signal due to non-specific binding was tested with various membrane materials, and Durapore® polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) had the lowest background signal. Different chemiluminescent reagents were studied to achieve the highest sensitivity combined with a low reagent background. SuperSignal® LBA produced a significantly higher signal output than Luminol/Enhencer and LumiGLOTM reagents. Two different diameter membranes, 25 mm and 13 mm, were first tested in a luminometer tube format assay. A hand-operated syringe filtration unit was used to capture cells and the membrane was then transferred to a luminometer tube for the chemiluminescent reaction. The sensitivity of the immunoassay was approximately 104 CFU/ml of S. aureus. Efforts had been made to refine the immunoassay into a simple, sensitive and rapid chemiluminescent fiber optic biosensor. An improved system utilized a simple but efficient microwell plate vacuum filtration unit with an 8 mm membrane sealed {{at the bottom of the}} sample well. The sample was concentrated on the membrane and positioned directly in front of a fiber <b>optic</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> to effectively collect and transmit the signal to the luminometer. Labeling S. aureus in solution proved to be much more effective than on the membrane surface. Using the microwell plate filtration system resulted in less sample handling, better reproducibility, and dramatically reduced assay time. The average variability for 25 mm and 13 mm assays were 24. 7 % and 13. 3 %, while the microwell plate assay reduced this to only 4. 0 %. The ability of the fiber optic probe to effectively collect the signal meant the sensitivity of the assay was not compromised with smaller membrane and sample size. The sensitivity of the biosensor was 3. 8 × 104 CFU/ml, adequate to detect the organism at concentrations lower than the level that could result in food poisoning. The biosensor demonstrated specificity to S. aureus cells in the presence of sample food materials as well as in buffer. ...|$|E
