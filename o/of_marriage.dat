5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about the legal status <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license {{on the grounds that}} India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself.

The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and marital relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E

5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{these two}} rates are not {{directly}} comparable since the marriage rate only examines the current year, while the divorce rate examines the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> for many previous years.
