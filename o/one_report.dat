Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded.

An estimated 15,000 people evacuated from threatened areas in the path of Madeline. According to <b>one</b> <b>report,</b> evacuations prior to Madeline were considered a success. Hurricane warnings and flood warnings were issued along the coastlines of Michoacán and Guerrero. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued for nine states in Mexico. This warning area extended as far inland as the area west of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it {{is thought to be}} generally autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and <b>one</b> <b>report</b> describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.|$|E

After the Left Platform split from Syriza to Popular Unity, the Group of 53 became the most left-wing faction within Syriza.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{economic}} growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained {{the largest number}} of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005; under its later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's {{children under the age of}} five are underweight. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India is perceived to have increased significantly, with <b>one</b> <b>report</b> estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion.|$|E

5|$|Manuel the Armenian was a {{prominent}} Byzantine general of Armenian origin, active from circa 810 until his death. After reaching the highest military ranks, a palace conspiracy forced him to seek refuge in the Abbasid court in 829. He returned to Byzantine service the next year, receiving the position of Domestic of the Schools from Emperor Theophilos, who had married his niece Theodora. Manuel remained in the post throughout Theophilos's reign, and reportedly saved the emperor's life in the Battle of Anzen in 838. According to <b>one</b> <b>report,</b> he died on 27 July 838 of wounds received during the battle, but other sources record his survival past this date, ascribing him {{a major role in}} the regency that governed the empire after Theophilos's death, and report that he died some time around 860.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to <b>one</b> <b>report</b> based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{damage was}} minimal {{as a result}} of Katrina. Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was {{estimated}} that between 10 and 15inches (250 to 375mm) of rain fell across parts of the region {{as a result of}} Katrina, with <b>one</b> <b>report</b> of 3.58inches (91mm) in six hours from the island of San Andrés east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Aguán.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Army {{could muster}} 22 divisions, which {{contained}} 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These {{had an excellent}} 47mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. <b>One</b> <b>report</b> states that a round from a 47mm gun went straight through a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns were better than the 25mm and 37mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home.

After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it.

Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam.
