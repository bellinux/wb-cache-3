5|$|Painting <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> cloth using glue size as {{a binder}} {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
5|$|The Entombment is a glue-size {{painting}} <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> {{attributed to}} the Early Netherlandish painter Dieric Bouts. It shows {{a scene from the}} biblical entombment of Christ, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes from the Life of Christ. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of the Holy Sacrament. The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost. The Entombment was first recorded in a mid-19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery, London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861.|$|E

25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera <b>on</b> <b>linen,</b> as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E
500|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{embroidery}} style combining split stitch and couching with {{silk and}} [...] goldwork in gold or silver-gilt thread of the Durham examples flowered from the 12th to the 14th centuries into a style known to contemporaries as Opus Anglicanum or [...] "English work".

Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread <b>on</b> white <b>linen,</b> and <b>on</b> rare occasion with white thread <b>on</b> brown <b>linen.</b> Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|R

500|$|A {{variety of}} plants produce red dyes, {{including}} {{a number of}} lichens, henna, alkanet or dyer's bugloss (Alkanna tinctoria), asafoetida and dyer's madder Rubia tinctorum.

[...] Madder has been identified <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> in the tomb of Tutankhamun, and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome. Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic alizarin dye in 1869. [...] Madder was also used to dye the [...] "hunting pinks" [...] of Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|By mixing a {{small amount}} of Mrs Stewart's Bluing with water, and then adding the {{solution}} to wash water, fabric items are made whiter. Mrs. Stewart's Bluing is a very gentle product, and can be used on the most delicate items. Traditionally, Mrs Stewart's Bluing has been used <b>on</b> <b>linens,</b> white clothing, towels and lace. Bluing works by making fabrics appear whiter. The human eye views slightly blue tints as very white. When properly used, Mrs Stewart's Bluing adds a hint of blue to fabrics, which makes them appear whiter to the eye.|$|R

500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, money that had {{previously}} been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions. [...] Varieties of design in textiles succeeded each other very rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. [...] The work produced by the London workshops was simplified {{to meet the demands of}} this deteriorating market. [...] The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. [...] Surface couching replaced underside couching, and allover embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns, [...] "thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest." ...|$|E
500|$|Pieter Bruegel the Elder {{began his}} career {{illustrating}} landscapes and fantastic scenes in a dense style that earned him a reputation as artistic heir to Hieronymus Bosch. [...] He soon came to {{follow the example of}} another master, Pieter Aertsen, who had {{made a name for himself}} in the 1550s depicting everyday scenes in a highly realistic style, such as the detailed array of meat products that dominate his large Butcher's Stall of 1551. Bruegel's subjects became more quotidian and his style observational. [...] He achieved fame for detailed, accurate and realistic portrayals of peasants, with whom his paintings were popular. [...] He painted <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> canvas and oak panel, and avoided scenes of magnificence and portraits of nobility or royalty. [...] The peasants Bruegel at first depicted were featureless and undifferentiated; as his work matured, their physiognomy became markedly more detailed and expressive.|$|E
500|$|Cloth {{manufacture}} {{was largely}} domestic. Rough plaids were produced, {{but the most}} important areas of manufacturing was linen, particularly in the Lowlands, with some commentators suggesting that Scottish flax was superior to Dutch. The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> and from 1727 it received subsidies of £2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. These funds were derived from the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, using money set aside at the Union. It distributed £6,000 a year to encourage industry, particularly the linen industry and fishing. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738. The move of the British Linen Company in 1746 into advancing cash credits also stimulated production. The trade was soon being managed by [...] "manufacturers" [...] who supplied flax to spinners, bought back the yarn and then supplied to the weavers and then bought the cloth they produced and resold that.|$|E

500|$|The Entombment {{is painted}} <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> tightly woven with 20 to 22 {{vertical}} and between 19 and 22 horizontal threads per centimetre. The cloth is Z-spun (tightly spun) and tabby woven with flax perhaps combined with cotton.

Before the paint was applied, the linen was first mounted on a temporary stretcher and outlined with a brown border – now visible on the lower border – which {{was used as a}} guide to cut the picture down before framing. Glue-sizing consists of creating a distemper by mixing pigments in water and then using a glue-base derived from boiled animal skin and other tissues as a binder. The pigments were applied to a linen cloth, treated with the same glue sizing, [...] fixed in turn to its frame by glue. [...] The paint saturated the cloth, [...] often leaving an image on the reverse side, which was lined with an additional cloth.|$|E
500|$|The {{major change}} in {{international}} trade was {{the rapid expansion of}} the Americas as a market. Glasgow supplied the colonies with cloth, iron farming implements and tools, glass and leather goods. Initially relying on hired ships, by 1736 it had 67 of its own, a third of which were trading with the New World. Glasgow emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy tobacco lords, who dominated the city for most of the century. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum. Cloth manufacture was largely domestic. Rough plaids were produced, but the most important areas of manufacturing was linen, particularly in the Lowlands, with some commentators suggesting that Scottish flax was superior to Dutch.

Banking also developed in this period. The Bank of Scotland, founded in 1695 was suspected of Jacobite sympathies and so a rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade.|$|E
