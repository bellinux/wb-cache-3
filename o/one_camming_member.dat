40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an improved expandable intramedullary nail for the fixation of bone fractures. The nail includes an elongate sleeve having one end adapted to be inserted within the medullary cavity of the bone. The {{one end of}} the sleeve is formed of a predetermined maximum retracted diameter to permit the insertion of the one end within the bone cavity. A plurality of circumferentially spaced, radially expandable elements are carried by the {{one end of the}} sleeve. The elements are radially movable from a first, retracted position wherein the elements define a first diameter to a second, expanded position wherein the elements define a second diameter greater than the predetermined maximum retracted diameter and the first diameter. In accordance with the present invention, when the elements are in the expanded position, the elements provide at least two support points at the second diameter and axially spaced along the sleeve for engagement with the inner wall of the bone cavity. A <b>camming</b> <b>member</b> is carried by the one end of the elongate sleeve for moving the elements from the retracted position to the expanded position. An actuator is located {{at the other end of}} the sleeve and is coupled to operate the <b>camming</b> <b>member</b> for controlling the radial position of the elements...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) {{has been growing}} rapidly in the U. S. in recent years. The proportion of adults reporting the use of at least <b>one</b> <b>CAM</b> therapy {{during the previous year}} increased from 33. 8 % in 1990 to 42. 1 % in 1997 (1).

A recent study using 2002 NHIS data showed that about half of all adults with diabetes were CAM users (3). The main reasons for the rising popularity of CAM range from the actual/perceived inadequacies of conventional treatments to the desire for more autonomy in treatment decisions (3, 4). Interestingly, CAM use is rising {{while at the same time}} conventional medicine has become less affordable (5).

40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) regulates {{steady-state}} inactivation {{of sodium}} currents (Na V 1. 4) in skeletal muscle. Defects in Na current inactivation {{are associated with}} pathological muscle conditions such as myotonia and paralysis. The mechanisms of CaM modulation of expression and function of the Na channel are incompletely understood. A physical association between CaM and the intact C terminus of Na V 1. 4 has not previously been demonstrated. FRET reveals channel conformation-independent association of CaM with the C terminus of Na V 1. 4 (CT-Na V 1. 4) in mammalian cells. Mutation of the Na V 1. 4 CaM-binding IQ motif (Na V 1. 4 IQ/AA) reduces cell surface expression of Na V 1. 4 channels and eliminates CaM modulation of gating. Truncations of the CT that include the IQ region abolish Na current. Na V 1. 4 channels with <b>one</b> <b>CaM</b> fused to the CT by variable length glycine linkers exhibit CaM modulation of gating only with linker lengths that allowed CaM to reach IQ region. Thus <b>one</b> <b>CaM</b> is sufficient to modulate Na current, and CaM acts as an ancillary subunit of Na V 1. 4 channels that binds to the CT in a conformation-independent fashion, modulating the voltage dependence of inactivation and facilitating trafficking to the surface membrane...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) employed for treating patients with erectile dysfunction.

50|$|The binary cam overcomes this by 'slaving' each cam to the other; as <b>one</b> <b>cam</b> {{is unable}} to rotate without the direct {{equivalent}} action of the other, the two rotate in near perfect synchronization, with any possible differences in rotation automatically correcting themselves as the shot cycle is completed.

This study provides evidence for regulation of cell interactions through modulation of ankyrin binding to neurofascin, a member of the L 1 CAM family of nervous system cell adhesion molecules. The phosphorylation state of the conserved FIGQY tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin regulates ankyrin binding and governs neurofascin-dependent cell aggregation as well as cell sorting when neurofascin is expressed in neuroblastoma cells.

40|$|Objective: The {{manifold}} {{studies on}} the usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) indicate that its utilization differs with respect to socio-cultural background, gender, age and underlying disease. This study intended to analyze the usage of specific CAM practices among a population of older German adults with health insurance coverage. Methods: Data of 5 830 older individuals who participated in an anonymous cross sectional survey among German insurance beneficiaries were analyzed with respect to usage of CAM treatments applied by medical doctors or non-medical practitioners within the last 5 years. Results: The most frequently used approaches were acupuncture/traditional Chinese medicine (21 %), homeopathy (21 %), movement therapies/physical exercises (19 %), osteopathy/chiropractic (12 %), herbs/phytotherapy (7 %), diets/specific food recommendations (6 %) and foot reflexology (5 %). Anthroposophic medicine was used only to a minor degree. Acupuncture and homeopathy users were likely to choose more than <b>one</b> <b>CAM</b> treatment simultaneously, particularly the combination of homeopathy and acupuncture. Moreover, this study can confirm significant differences {{between women and men}} {{in the use of the}} main relevant CAM interventions. Conclusion: The relative proportion of acupuncture usage was similar to homeopathy, which is an alternative whole medical system originating from Western Europe. This means that an Eastern alternative system is established also in Germany. In several cases not only <b>one</b> <b>CAM</b> treatment was used but distinct combinations existed (particularly homeopathy and acupuncture); thus one should be cautious to draw predictive conclusions from studies with broad and unspecific CAM categories, for among them there are several therapies which should not be regarded as CAM...|$|R

50|$|As a {{camshaft}} normally {{has only}} one lobe per valve, the valve duration and lift is fixed. The camshaft rotates at half {{the rate of the}} crankshaft. Although many modern engines use camshaft phasing, adjusting the lift and valve duration in a working engine is more difficult. Some manufacturers use systems with more than <b>one</b> <b>cam</b> lobe, but this is still a compromise as only a few profiles can be in operation at once. This is not the case with the camless engine, where lift and valve timing can be adjusted freely from valve to valve and from cycle to cycle. It also allows multiple lift events per cycle and, indeed, no events per cycleâswitching off the cylinder entirely.|$|R

50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different <b>cam</b> profiles. <b>One</b> <b>cam</b> profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift.

Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm locking pins to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with locking pins to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R

40|$|Myosin VI {{contains}} an inserted sequence that is unique among myosin superfamily members {{and has been}} suggested to be a determinant of the reverse directionality and unusual motility of the motor. It is thought that each head of a two-headed myosin VI molecule binds <b>one</b> calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> {{by means of a}} single âIQ motifâ. Using truncations of the myosin VI protein and electrospray ionization(ESI) -MS, we demonstrate that in fact each myosin VI head binds two <b>CaMs.</b> <b>One</b> <b>CaM</b> binds to a conventional IQ motif either with or without calcium and likely plays a regulatory role when calcium binds to its N-terminal lobe. The second CaM binds to a unique insertion between the converter region and IQ motif. This unusual CaM-binding site normally binds CaM with four Ca 2 + and can bind only if the C-terminal lobe of CaM is occupied by calcium. Regions of the MD outside of the insert peptide contribute to the Ca 2 +âCaM binding, as truncations that eliminate elements of the MD alter CaM binding and allow calcium dissociation. We suggest that the Ca 2 +-CaM bound to the unique insert represents a structural CaM, and not a calcium sensor or regulatory component of the motor. This structure is likely {{an integral part of the}} myosin VI âconverterâ region and repositions the myosin VI âlever armâ to allow reverse direction (minus-end) motility on actin...|$|R
