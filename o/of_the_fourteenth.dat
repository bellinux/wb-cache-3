5|$|In 1863, Knott {{returned}} to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in Lebanon. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867.

He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal appeals in large part becauseas Barron v. Baltimore (1833) heldthe Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments. This continued until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The Due Process Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} December 1865, Bramlette sought to restore harmony {{in the state}} by issuing pardons to most ex-Confederates. He and the {{majority}} of the General Assembly opposed passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> and Fifteenth amendments, and Bramlette protested the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bramlette {{issued a}} general pardon for most ex-Confederates in the state. He opposed {{ratification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> and Fifteenth Amendments {{and the establishment}} of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky. Among his accomplishments not related to the war and its aftermath were the reduction of the state's debt {{and the establishment of}} the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (now the University of Kentucky). Following his term as governor, Bramlette returned to his legal practice in Louisville. He died January 12, 1875 and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which from the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourteenth</b> century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E

5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourteenth</b> and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Davis became {{president}} of the Carolina Life Insurance Company in Memphis, Tennessee, where he resided at the Peabody Hotel. Upon General Lee's death in 1870, Davis presided over the memorial meeting in Richmond. Elected to the U.S. Senate again, he was refused the office in 1875, having been barred from federal office by Section Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment to the United States Constitution. He turned down the opportunity to become the first president of the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A University).|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{had been}} ineligible {{to serve in}} Congress because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn {{allegiance}} to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office.

He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began {{to adopt a}} more {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourteenth</b> Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
