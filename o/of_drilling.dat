The Battalion spent three weeks rehearsing for the three-hour tattoo, {{which was the first}} held by a single military unit in Rhodesia. The men gave demonstrations <b>of</b> <b>drilling,</b> physical training and unarmed combat; a staged assault on a guerrilla camp was held by 2 Commando, using blank ammunition and dummy mortars. The show culminated with a sky-dive by three Battalion Parachute Club members, Captain Garth Barrett, Sergeant Dennis Croukamp and Major John Pierson. Following this a retreat ceremony was held as well as a final march-past by all participants.|$|E

During {{exploitation}} <b>of</b> {{horizontal well}} <b>drilling</b> engineering, the problem <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string failure is very serious, {{there are many}} reasons, and drill string vibrations are main reasons. In this paper <b>drill</b> string <b>of</b> horizontal well is object being studied. The models about various vibrations are set up. The vibration rule <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string is obtained under different situation; the axial and lateral frequency <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string vibration in free state is studied. The analysis of modal vibration <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string {{is the basis of}} the analysis of harmonic vibration <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string.

Collision and friction between drill string and well wall, displacement response on the drill bit and other boundary conditions were considered in this simulated modeling. By using finite element analysis software ANSYS, the dynamic characteristics of horizontal section <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string were calculated and discussed. The effect of different positions of stabilizers on the vibration characteristics <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string were studied specially. The calculated {{results show that the}} installation positions of stabilizers have remarkable effects on the dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string. It will change the lateral vibration and whirling motion <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string remarkably. Furthermore, the reasonably installation of the stabilizers can decrease the amplitudes of lateral vibration and transient torque. Those results may provide some guidance for the vibration analysis <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> string system...|$|R

5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
