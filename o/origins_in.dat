5|$|In {{common with}} other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped {{feathered}} serpent deities. Such worship was rare during the Classic period, {{but by the}} Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was Kukulkan, among the K'iche' it was Q'uq'umatz. Kukulkan had his <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> First World countries.

The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, when Japanese and European {{cultures}} met, fortification in Europe {{had moved}} beyond castles and relied on innovations {{such as the}} Italian trace italienne and star forts. Forts in India present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17thcentury, castles in Europe had generally fallen out of use militarily. Like shiro, the Indian forts, durga or durg in Sanskrit, shared features with castles in Europe such as acting as a domicile for a lord {{as well as being}} fortifications. They too developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E
5|$|From {{its initial}} <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Sicily, {{especially}} in Catania, the movement got its real impetus {{with the establishment}} of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892.

Between March and October the number of fasci grew from 35 to 162 with more than 200,000 members.|$|E

5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their <b>origins</b> <b>in</b> Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training.

Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E
