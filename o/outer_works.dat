5|$|On 26 October, Baillet de Latour {{immediately}} lay {{the groundwork}} for a lengthy siege by ordering the construction of extensive earthworks around the bridgehead. The lines of contravallation (the trenches nearest to the French position) included a series of redoubts connected by trenches. Initially, the French considered these to be purely defensive and they were inclined to ignore the industrious Austrian diggers and focus instead on their own fortifications, which were sketchy and relied upon palisades unprotected by dirt; these could not withstand a vigorous attack until strengthened. After several days of strengthening their <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> by 30 October, several artillery pieces were brought up to augment the outer defense. In addition, released from the main army after the Battle of Schliengen, General Dessaix arrived to command the fortress and augment the garrison with his troops. Subsequently, French reconstruction of the fortress and its defensive lines increased. Several minor sorties against the Austrian lines resulted. On 14 November 1796, Dominique Vandamme, commanding a column of Dessaix's force, directed a small group of skirmishers and hussars to attack the most forward of the Austrian posts. This successful sortie took eighty Austrian prisoners. On 21 November, while the Austrians constructed their trenches on the right bank of the Kinzig, the French planned for a considerable sortie against the lines of contravallation between the Kinzig and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|By early November 1776, the {{majority}} of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign. They were initially stationed at Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and nearby Fort Lee {{on the opposite side of}} the Hudson River. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington. The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced. About 140 of the regiment's officers and enlisted men—one-third of the unit's total complement of about 420 men—were not present at the battle, however, because they were still completing organization and recruiting. A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining active force, which continued to serve with the Main Army. On December 1, the first day of the army's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington, Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit's highest ranking officers still free—Capts. Alexander Lawson Smith and Gabriel Long. Smith's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment, whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long's command.|$|E
5|$|Fort Donelson {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson, who {{selected}} its site and began construction in 1861. It was considerably more formidable than Fort Henry. Fort Donelson rose about 100 feet (30m) on approximately 100 acres of dry ground above the Cumberland River, which allowed for plunging fire against attacking gunboats, an advantage Fort Henry did not enjoy. The river batteries included twelve guns: ten 32-pounder smoothbore cannons, two 9-pounder smoothbore cannons, a 8-inch howitzer, a 6.5-inch rifle (128-pounder), and a 10-inch Columbiad. There were three miles (5km) of trenches in a semicircle around the fort and {{the small town of}} Dover. The <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> were bounded by Hickman Creek to the west, Lick Creek to the east, and the Cumberland River to the north. These trenches, located on a commanding ridge and fronted by a dense abatis of cut trees and limbs stuck into the ground and pointing outward, were backed up by artillery and manned by Buckner and his Bowling Green troops on the right (with his flank anchored on Hickman Creek), and Johnson/Pillow on the left (with his flank near the Cumberland River). Facing the Confederates, from left to right, were Smith, Lew Wallace (who arrived on February 14), and McClernand. McClernand's right flank, which faced Pillow, had insufficient men to reach overflowing Lick Creek, so it was left unanchored. Through the center of the Confederate line ran the marshy Indian Creek, this point defended primarily by artillery overlooking it on each side.|$|E
50|$|The remains {{comprise}} two parts: at the front, {{a square}} tower {{of two or}} three storeys, made in rough stones, measures 10 m on each side with walls 1.5 m thick. In the east are the remains of an <b>outer</b> <b>work,</b> and in the south is the access path.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the period}} between 1893 and 1898 {{restoration}} work took place. The dormers were made, and a neogothic spire clock tower was installed, replacing an earlier 18th century spire. In between the corner towers is a machicolation. From holes in the floor of this <b>outer</b> <b>work,</b> boiling oil could be thrown at enemies.|$|R
50|$|The hill fort {{is on an}} easterly spur {{from the}} main Quantock ridge, with steep natural slopes {{to the north and}} south-east. The fort is {{triangular}} in shape, with a single rampart and ditch (univallate), enclosing 1.8 ha. There is a linear <b>outer</b> <b>work</b> about 120 m away, parallel to the westerly rampart, enclosing another 1.8 ha.|$|R

25|$|Smaller sorties of 2,000–3,000 men {{continued}} to operate out of Cadiz from April to August 1811. On 26 October British naval gunboats from Gibraltar destroyed French positions at St. Mary's, killing French artillery commander Alexandre-Antoine Hureau de Sénarmont. An attempt by Victor {{to crush the}} small Anglo-Spanish garrison at Tarifa over the winter of 1811–1812 was frustrated by torrential rains and an obstinate defence, marking an end to French operations against the city's <b>outer</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> fell, General Wilson led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge {{down the}} Range Line Road toward the {{unfinished}} inner line of works. The retreating Confederate forces, upon reaching the inner works, united and fired repeatedly together into the charging column. This {{broke up the}} charge and sent General Wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded. He quickly remounted his stricken horse and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments.|$|E
60|$|The Béin fort {{has been}} {{repaired}} and whitewashed inside by the lessees, Messieurs Swanzy, whose agent, Mr. Carr, we found here in possession.

60|$|The ground about Vicksburg {{is admirable}} for defence. On the north {{it is about}} two hundred feet above the Mississippi River at the highest point and very much cut up by the washing rains; the ravines were grown up with cane and underbrush, while the sides and tops were covered with a dense forest. Farther south the ground {{flattens}} out somewhat, and was in cultivation. But here, too, it was cut up by ravines and small streams. The enemy's line of defence followed {{the crest of a}} ridge from the river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to the Jackson road, full three miles back of the city; thence in a southwesterly direction to the river. Deep ravines of the description given lay in front of these defences. As there is a succession of gullies, cut out by rains {{along the side of the}} ridge, the line was necessarily very irregular. To follow each of these spurs with intrenchments, so as to command the slopes on either side, would have lengthened their line very much. Generally therefore, or in many places, their line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight to the head of another, and an <b>outer</b> <b>work</b> triangular in shape, generally open in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in this <b>outer</b> <b>work</b> they commanded the approaches to the main line completely.|$|R
25|$|Various stormattacks {{followed}} on the <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> of the fortress, but the defences held firm. The French {{had also}} dug mines under the redoubts, ravelins and lunettes to blow them up. They {{were in their}} turn countermined by Dutch sappers. On 25 July Loudon's Highlanders, {{also known as the}} 64th Foot, made a sally from Fort Rover which took and destroyed a major French battery. Over the course of the siege, other British troops, engineers and artillery joined the allied garrison as well as some Austrian miners.|$|E
500|$|The defence, or lack thereof, of Sugar Loaf was {{complicated}} by the widespread perception that Fort Ticonderoga, with a reputation as the [...] "Gibraltar of the North", had to be held. [...] Neither abandoning the fort nor garrisoning it with a small force (sufficient {{to respond to a}} feint but not to an attack in strength) was viewed as a politically viable option. [...] Defending the fort and the associated <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> would require all the troops currently there, leaving none to defend Sugar Loaf. [...] Furthermore, George Washington and the Congress were of the opinion that Burgoyne, who was known to be in Quebec, was more likely to strike from the south, moving his troops by sea to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In this length, {{there are}} points {{where the road}} seems to show in the modern {{landscape}} - for example, here [...] In the south, the modern road lies on the Roman one which continued through Elsea Wood and along the field boundary to its north. The Car Dyke lies {{to the east and}} the boundary between Elsea wood and Math Wood seems to lie {{along the edge of the}} 2nd century road verge, which was cleared for security. The carriageway, the Car Dyke and the Math Wood boundary are all parallel here. When allowance is made for the now-missing <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> of the Car Dyke, the carriageway lies half way between the other two features.|$|E

40|$|When {{organizations}} do {{not attend}} to social justice {{issues in a}} meaningful way, a pattern of covert practices and behavior distorts the concern for fairness, equity and inclusion to one of indifference, power and control. Ineffective leadership results in wounded staff and organizational dysfunction. Social justice in organizational life {{is a function of}} how well leaders and managers master six domains that influence and sustain institutional balance and self-regulation: safety and trust; boundaries and differences; accountability; communication; hierarchical power; and task and role clarity. Ultimately, leaders must do their own inner work by taking responsibility for their part in institutionalizing oppression in their organizations, and well as the <b>outer</b> <b>work</b> of creating processes and structures that implement solutions to social justice issues within their organizations...|$|R

2500|$|British efforts then {{focused on}} Fort Mozello, {{subjecting}} the fort to a heavy fire {{for a further}} twelve days, at which point a breach had been blown in the western wall of the badly-damaged fort. During this period French counter-battery fire proved effective and dangerous; Serocold was killed by cannon fire while manning a battery, and Nelson severely injured by flying stone splinters on 12 July, eventually losing the sight in his right eye. With Mozello weakened, Stuart gave orders for {{an assault on the}} <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> of the fort on 18 July; batteries were thrown up overnight by the 50th Regiment of Foot to provide cover for a general attack at daylight by elements of the Royal Fusiliers under Lieutenant Colonel John Moore and the Royal Irish Regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel David Wemyss. Despite heavy musket fire and hand to hand fighting with French pikemen the British regiments captured the outer batteries, stormed the breach and took possession of the fort.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, General Upton, observing Long's success, {{ordered his}} own {{division}} forward. Soon, U.S. flags {{could be seen}} waving over the works from Range Line Road to Summerfield Road. Once the <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> had fallen, General Wilson himself led the 4th U.S. Cavalry Regiment in a mounted charge down the Range Line Road toward the unfinished inner line of works. [...] The retreating Confederate forces, having reached the inner works, rallied and poured a devastating fire into the charging Union column. [...] This stopped the charge, and sent General Wilson sprawling to the ground when his favorite horse was wounded. Wilson quickly remounted his injured horse and ordered a dismounted assault by several regiments. Mixed units of Confederate troops at the Selma railroad depot and the adjoining banks of the railroad bed {{tried to make a}} stand next to the Plantersville Road (present day Broad Street). Fighting there was heavy, but by 7 p.m. the superior numbers of Union troops had allowed them to flank the Southern positions, causing the defenders to abandon the depot as well as the inner line of works.|$|E
2500|$|The attack, however, drew Confederate {{attention}} away from the river gate, where Ames prepared to launch his attack. At 2:00 p.m. he sent forward his first brigade, under the command of Brevet Brigadier Newton Martin Curtis, as Ames waited with the brigades of colonels Galusha Pennypacker and Louis Bell. An advance guard from Curtis's brigade used axes to cut through the palisades and abatis. Curtis's brigade took heavy casualties as it overran the <b>outer</b> <b>works</b> and stormed the first traverse. At this point Ames ordered Pennypacker's brigade forward, which he accompanied into the fort. As Ames marched forward, Confederate snipers zeroed in on his party, and cut down a number of his aides from around him. Pennypacker's men fought their way through the riverside gate, and Ames ordered a portion of his men to fortify a position within the interior of the fort. Meanwhile, the Confederates turned the cannons in Battery Buchanan at the southern tip of the peninsula and fired on the northern wall as it fell into Union hands. Ames observed that Curtis's lead units had become stalled at the fourth traverse, [...] and he ordered forward Bell's brigade, but Bell was killed by sharpshooters before ever reaching the fort. Seeing the Union attackers crowd into the breach and interior, Whiting took the opportunity to personally lead a counterattack. Charging into the Union soldiers, Whiting received multiple demands to surrender, and when he refused he was shot down, severely wounded.|$|E

50|$|After the War of 1812, {{there was}} a {{thorough}} review of the nation's fortification needs and {{it was decided to}} replace the older Fort Adams with a newer and much larger fort.

The new fort was designed by Brigadier General Simon Bernard, a Frenchman who had served as a military engineer under Napoleon. Bernard designed the new Fort Adams in the classic style and it became the most complex fortification in the Western Hemisphere. It included a tenaille and crownwork, a complex <b>outer</b> <b>work</b> on the southern (landward) side, designed to break up and channel an assault force.
