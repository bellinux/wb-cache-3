5|$|The London–Brighton turnpike {{ran through}} the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road. When Britain's major roads were {{classified}} by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923, it was given the number A23. It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to {{the east side of}} the town by the M23 motorway, which was opened in 1975. This connects London's <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway,</b> the M25, to the A23 at Pease Pottage, at the southern edge of Crawley's built-up area. The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{connected}} by road on a north-south axis reaching Viana do Castelo and the Spanish border to Porto by the A28 motorway. In Greater Porto, the A28 {{has the most}} popular suburban commercial areas of Northern Portugal with suburban shopping centers, large stand-alone stores, retail parks and outlets and reaches Porto's major thoroughfares and ring roads, including the VCI inner <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway.</b> Póvoa is also reached by the A7 (from Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão) and A11 (from Braga and Barcelos) motorways on an east-west axis, through the south and north of the city, in that order, and both cross the A28. With these motorways, Póvoa de Varzim is accessible within minutes and central in the Northern Littoral Urban-Metropolitan Region of Northern Portugal, with 2.99 million inhabitants (2001 census).|$|E
5|$|Urmston {{comprises}} {{the areas of}} Davyhulme, Dumplington, Flixton and Urmston, with the River Mersey forming the southern boundary. For administrative reasons, Partington is sometimes considered {{to be part of}} Urmston. The most southerly part of Urmston lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey, an area known as Urmston Meadows, part of the Mersey Valley. Much work was carried out in the 1970s to canalise the Mersey, in an effort to speed up the flow of floodwater and thus reduce the risk of flooding. Upstream emergency floodbasins such as Sale Water Park, lying just to the east of Urmston, have also been constructed. The M60 Manchester <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> passes through the northern half of Urmston, from southeast to northwest, and the M62 motorway lies just to the west. The Thirlmere Aqueduct also passes through the Urmston area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. - <b>Orbital</b> <b>motorways</b> {{are major}} {{structuring}} {{elements in the}} metropolitan areas of developed countries.

It is well known that orbital impacts are quite different depending on its location within the metropolitan area (inner and outer) as well as the activity distributional performance (agglomeration vs. decentralization of activities). The effects are going to be analyzed from a twofold perspective: equity and efficiency. These topics have been scarcely addressed in previous works.

25|$|The M60 motorway, Manchester Ring Motorway, or Manchester Outer Ring Road, is an <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> in Greater Manchester, a {{metropolitan}} county in North West England. Built over a 40-year period, {{it passes through}} all Greater Manchester's metropolitan boroughs except for Wigan and Bolton. Most of the City of Manchester is encompassed within the motorway, except for the southernmost {{part of the city}} (primarily the Wythenshawe area and Manchester Airport), which are served by the M56.|$|E
25|$|Greater Manchester and Greater London are {{the only}} two UK conurbations with a {{separately}} numbered <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> (though it is possible to circumnavigate Birmingham via several differently numbered motorways). The Manchester ring road is called the M60. Unlike London's M25, the M60 actually runs within the Greater Manchester conurbation providing good inter-suburban links, rather than around the outside of the conurbation. The M60 has 27 junctions, numbered clockwise from junction 1 at Stockport in the south-east.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} part of the M25 began in 1972 but before it opened, plans for the London <b>Orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> were {{modified}} to combine the southern and western part of Ringway 4 with the northern and eastern part of Ringway 3. To connect the two separate routes, which together were numbered as the M25, an additional section of road needed to be planned and the M25 route was diverted northwards from junction 5 to meet Ringway 3 at Swanley (M25 junction 3).|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>orbital</b> <b>motorways</b> (or beltways) are {{purpose-built}} major highways {{around a}} town or city, typically without either signals or road or railroad crossings. In the United States, beltways are commonly {{parts of the}} Interstate Highway System. Similar roads in the United Kingdom are often called [...] "orbital motorways". Although the terms [...] "ring road" [...] and [...] "orbital motorway" [...] are sometimes used interchangeably, [...] "ring road" [...] often indicates a circumferential route formed from one or more existing roads within a city or town, with the standard of road being anything from an ordinary city street up to motorway level. An excellent {{example of this is}} London's North Circular/South Circular ring road.|$|R
50|$|Dartford gives {{its name}} to the Dartford Crossing of the River Thames, a pair of road tunnels (constructed in 1963 and 1980), with the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge (October 1991), dual-linking Kent with Essex and {{connecting}} sections of the London <b>Orbital</b> M25 <b>motorway.</b>|$|R

25|$|Whitefield's {{proximity}} to the M60 <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> and city of Manchester has ensured {{that there are many}} small businesses and trading estates located locally. Whitefield has experienced several new commercial developments {{since the turn of the}} 21st century, for example with the replacement of Elms Shopping Precinct by a new gym and several new outlets and with a new Morrisons supermarket built in 2008 on land previously occupied by a public house, the bus station and a former retail premises which had seen several uses.|$|E
25|$|Being both on {{the river}} and close to London, Thurrock is served with good {{communication}} links. The M25 London <b>Orbital</b> <b>Motorway,</b> the railway line between Southend and London Fenchurch Street which provides direct access to Central London and, eventually, Stratford International Station, the Port of Tilbury and the nearby London City Airport make Thurrock an important international trade centre. There is a grass airstrip south of Bulphan village. A ferry for passengers on foot connects Tilbury with Gravesend on the southern bank of the River Thames.|$|E
25|$|Greater Manchester has {{a higher}} {{percentage}} of the motorway network than any other county. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways – the M61 at Linnyshaw Moss, Greater Manchester, close to the M60 interchange. The M60 is one of only two motorways in the UK designated as an 'Orbital Motorway', (the other being the M25 around London), although the latter is not technically an entire <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> as a short non-motorway stretch forms the Dartford Crossing.|$|E

25|$|Croydon {{is linked}} into the {{national}} motorway network via the M23 and M25 <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway.</b> The M25 skirts {{the south of the}} borough, linking Croydon with other parts of London and the surrounding counties; the M23 branches from the M25 close to Coulsdon, linking the town with the south coast, Crawley, Reigate, and London Gatwick Airport. The A23 connects the borough with the motorways. The A23 is the major trunk road through Croydon, linking it with central London, East Sussex, Horsham, and Littlehaven. The old London to Brighton road, passes through the west of the borough on Purley Way, bypassing the commercial centre of Croydon which it once did.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} big scheme was {{improvement}} of the M30. This road is the inner ring motorway of Madrid. Significant portions of M30 run underground and its urban motorway tunnels have sections of more than 6 km in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction. Between the south entry of the Avenida de Portugal tunnel and the north exit of the M-30 south by-pass there are close to 10 km of continuous tunnels. M40 is a ring motorway which borders Madrid at a mean distance of 10.07 km {{and it has a}} total length of 63.3 km. M45 is a partial ring around the city serving the metropolitan area of Madrid. It was built to help alleviate the congestion of the M40 from the southern to the north-eastern, runs between the M40 and the M50 where the two ring motorways are more separated. M50 is the outer of the Madrid <b>orbital</b> <b>motorways</b> and has a total length of 85 km. It services mainly the metropolitan area at a mean distance of 13.5 km.|$|R
50|$|Harlow {{is reached}} from {{junction}} 7 of the M11 motorway, which runs from London to Cambridge, placing it {{within a short}} distance of Stansted Airport and the A120 and the <b>orbital</b> M25 <b>motorway.</b> Running through the town is the A414, a major road from Hertford to Chelmsford and linking the town with the A10 to the west. Another major road running from Harlow is the A1184, which also leads to {{the nearby town of}} Bishop's Stortford.|$|R
2500|$|The government's Smeed Report of 1964 was {{the first}} full {{assessment}} of the practicality of road pricing in a British city {{on the basis of}} congestion. It recommended a method of [...] "car user restraint" [...] by a variable system of charging for road usage – if the government had the will to do so. During {{the early years of the}} Greater London Council, which was formed in 1965, the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre. These plans were being developed at the same time as the London Ringways, a series of 4 <b>orbital</b> <b>motorways</b> around and within London including Ringway 1 (the London Motorway Box) leading to widespread public protest by Homes before Roads and others. Only a small section of these road schemes had been implemented by the time Labour gained control in the 1973 Greater London Council elections, and the new administration abandoned the road building plans in favour of public transport and traffic management. The new administration, to which Ken Livingstone had just been elected for the first time, studied a congestion scheme similar to the one which was eventually adopted the following year.|$|R
500|$|Although the {{majority}} of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> (the M25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected {{by a number of}} busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at [...] long. The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{finished}} in August 2008 in Moscow, Russia; {{it was the}} first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom; producer Katie Swinden stated that Spooks is usually [...] "London-orientated," [...] including when it comes to filming scenes set in other countries, and it usually does not take place outside the confines of the M25, an <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway</b> which encircles the UK's capital. However, the producers were able to afford to shoot in another country. A small crew were used to save costs. Armitage and Norris were the only two of the main actors who participated in the shoot. However, the main problem with filming in Moscow was of the 30 plus degree heat, and the actors had to wear winter coats because the episodes were set during the colder months.|$|E
500|$|Canterbury is {{by-passed}} by the A2 London to Dover Road. It {{is about}} [...] from the M25 London <b>orbital</b> <b>motorway,</b> and [...] from central London by road. The other main road through Canterbury is the A28 from Ashford to Ramsgate and Margate. The City Council has {{invested heavily in}} Park and Ride systems around the City's outskirts and there are three sites: at Wincheap, New Dover Road and Sturry Road. There are plans to build direct access sliproads {{to and from the}} London directions of the A2 where it meets the congested Wincheap (at present there are only slips from the A28 to and from the direction of Dover) to allow more direct access to Canterbury from the A2, but these are currently subject to local discussion. In 2011 a third junction was constructed, linking the A28 to the northbound A2; this leaves just the A2 southbound exit missing, but since this would cut across the Park & Ride car park and meet the A28 at an already complicated junction, it is not expected to be added in the near term.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} spatial and social impacts arising from {{implementation}} of a road-pricing scheme in the Madrid Metropolitan Area (MMA). Our analytical focus is on understanding {{the effects of the}} scheme on the transport accessibility of different social groups within the MMA. We define an evaluation framework to appraise the accessibility of different districts within the MMA in terms of the actual and perceived cost of using the road infrastructure "before" and "after" the implementation of the scheme. The framework was developed using quantitative survey data and qualitative data from focus group discussions with residents. We then simulated user behaviors (mode and route choice) based on the empirical evidence from a travel demand model for the MMA. The results from our simulation model demonstrated that implementation of the toll on the <b>orbital</b> metropolitan <b>motorways</b> (M 40, M 30, for example) decreases accessibility, mostly in the districts where there are no viable public transport alternatives. Our key finding is that the economic burden of the road-pricing scheme particularly affects unskilled and lower income individuals living in the south of the MMA. Consequently lower income people reduce their use of tolled roads and have to find new arrangements for these trips: i. e. switch to the public transport, spend double the time for their commuter trips or stay at home. The results of our research could be applicable more widely for anyone wishing to better understand the important relationship between increased transport cost and social equity, especially where there is an intention to introduce similar road-pricing schemes within the urban context...|$|R
