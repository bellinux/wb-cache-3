25|$|OBD II is {{no longer}} only used by {{professionals}} and hobbyists to repair vehicles. OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle telematics devices that perform fleet tracking, monitor fuel efficiency, prevent unsafe driving, {{as well as for}} remote diagnostics and by pay-as-you-drive insurance. Although originally not intended for the above purposes, commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed, RPM, and fuel level allow GPS-based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times, speeding, and <b>over-revving.</b> By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the nature of the problem. OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes.|$|E
500|$|Piquet retired on lap13, after {{spinning}} off and {{colliding with}} a wall. Following the race, the Renault driver blamed damp patches {{on the track}} for the incident, adding that [...] "It's a shame because I'm sure {{we could have done}} something today." [...] On lap17, Rubens Barrichello retired with a gearbox problem, suffering from a failing sixth gear and engine <b>over-revving.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To prevent <b>over-revving,</b> {{especially}} when driving without a trailer, {{the engine was}} fitted with a governor on the generator shaft (as fitted on the Type 155 static engine).|$|E
50|$|The engine {{will fail}} if <b>over-revved,</b> {{and it can}} also fail from {{overheating}} (but such a scenario is rare).|$|R
50|$|At the start, Al Unser swept {{from the}} outside of the front row, and led into turn one. Tom Sneva took second. Bobby Unser settled into third. Johnny Rutherford <b>over-revved</b> the engine, and dropped out with gearbox failure. Janet Guthrie was in the pits early with engine trouble. She would suffer a long day of {{numerous}} frustrating pits stops.|$|R
50|$|The {{most serious}} of the J2's {{technical}} failings is that {{has only a}} two-bearing crankshaft, which can break if <b>over-revved.</b> The overhead camshaft is driven by a vertical shaft through bevel gears, which also forms the armature of the dynamo. Thus any oil leak from the cambox seal goes into the dynamo brushgear, presenting a fire hazard.|$|R
50|$|In {{chain saw}} operation, where natural {{fluctuation}} of chain bite during a cut can cause momentary <b>over-revving,</b> the full throttle mixture is adjusted for four-stroking to occur at a set high rpm, cutting engine speed and enriching lubrication.|$|E

50|$|The {{scene where}} Big John tells Cole and Rowdy they will drive to dinner {{together}} {{is based on}} an actual meeting Bill France, Sr. had in the 1980s between Dale Earnhardt and Geoff Bodine. One scene in which Cole deliberately blows his engine by <b>over-revving</b> it reflects upon an incident in which Tim Richmond was said to have done so at Michigan in 1987.|$|E
50|$|This {{race was}} notable in that Pierre Levegh (Pierre Bouillin) {{attempted}} {{to drive the}} entire 24 Hours by himself - and almost won. Exhausted in the 24th hour, he missed a downshift in his Talbot-Lago and <b>over-revved</b> the engine, breaking a connecting rod. Antonio Lago carried {{a piece of the}} broken rod with him for several years thereafter as a keepsake.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{stroking}} {{will occur}} in a correctly adjusted two stroke engine at full throttle without load when the air-fuel mixture becomes overly rich and prevents the engine from running faster. At such high speeds too lean mixture will cause the engine to <b>over-rev</b> as well as overheat, and in engines running on premixed fuel a too lean mixture will cause poor lubrication.|$|R
50|$|Martland {{withdrew from}} the event after almost {{crashing}} on his second practice lap in the car, judging {{that it was too}} fast for him. Woolfe also <b>over-revved</b> the engine, causing it to fail, but Porsche transported a new unit to be fitted to his car. The German marque also loaned Woolfe two of its works drivers: Kurt Ahrens qualified the car in ninth position, whilst Herbert Linge was scheduled to partner Woolfe in the race.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} Grand Prix where grid {{positions}} were decided by practice time rather than the established method of balloting. Achille Varzi and Tazio Nuvolari exchanged the lead many times during the race and the race was settled in Varzi's favour on the final lap when Nuvolari's car caught fire due to <b>over-revving.</b> Nuvolari was then disqualified due to outside assistance while attempting to push his car to the finish.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 the Ducati Desmo {{dominated}} the racing {{season and the}} racing team was soon headed for the World Championship. Unfortunately a mid-season injury to winning Ducati rider Bruno Spaggiani spoilt their run, allowing Ubbiali to narrowly take the title again. Nevertheless, in that season the Desmodromic engine had proved its quality and reliability, in terms of maximizing engine power and as insurance against <b>over-revving</b> damage. These characteristics proved attractive to motorcycle buyers.|$|E
50|$|Following Le Mans, the DP215 {{appeared}} at the 12 Hours of Reims (a race accompanying the French GP), driven by Jo Schlesser. The car should have won easily, due to no serious opposition in the field. But after leading, Schlesser was having more trouble with the repaired CG537 transmission. Having difficulty changing gear, and missing gears, which caused <b>over-revving</b> of the engine, leading to bending all the valves, forcing the car to retire on lap 4.|$|E
2500|$|... 27 April 1980 saw {{the final}} ETCC race at Brands Hatch, {{literally}} saw Harald Neger blew away victory in his Racing Corporation Vienna BMW 635CSi. The Austrian stormed {{through the field}} in lap one, following a bad practice, but the engine had been <b>over-revved</b> – out! Now the Eggenberger Motorsport BMW 320s took over, and after Hans-Jürg Dürig had to retire with a broken seat, Siegfried Müller, Jr. and Helmut Kelleners won the race, with an older BMW 3.0 CSi second with the Belgian pairing of Michel Delcourt and Jean-Marie Baert.|$|R
50|$|All {{injection}} pumps incorporate a governor to cut fuel supply if the crankshaft rpm endangers the engine - the heavy moving parts of diesel engines do not tolerate overspeeding well, and catastrophic damage can occur {{if they are}} <b>over-revved.</b> Poorly maintained and worn engines can consume their lubrication oil through worn out crankcase ventilation systems and 'run away', causing increasing engine speed until the engine destroys itself. This is because most diesel engines only regulate their speed by fuel supply control and don't have a throttle valve to control air intake.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission {{also has the}} ability to change the shift points, and hold the gears longer when the engine is operating at higher RPM. This is achieved by pressing the accelerator pedal rapidly, which causes the transmission to hold the gear until 5000 rpm before shifting to the next gear. No indicator light appears in the instrument cluster, unlike previous generations. The transmission also has engine <b>over-rev</b> protection by shifting the transmission to the next available gear once 6500 rpm has been achieved, even if the gear selector is in a low gear position.|$|R
50|$|Launch control {{operates}} {{by using}} an electronic accelerator and a computer program. The software controls acceleration based on engine specifications to make the car accelerate smoothly and as fast as possible, avoiding spinning of the drive wheels, engine failure due to <b>over-revving,</b> and clutch and gearbox problems. In racing cars, this feature is only available {{at the start of}} the race, when the car is stationary in the starting grid. After the car is running at a certain speed, the software is disabled.|$|E
50|$|Before {{and after}} the race the player is able to set up tyre hardness, wing angle and the transmission, and can be forced to quit if the player fails to make a pitstop to replace worn out tyres, or simply overheats the engine by rapid {{downshifting}} at high speed, (<b>over-revving</b> is possible with automatic gears by knocking on other cars tyres, making the player car jump, causing a drastic increase in the RPM) noticeable by a loud squealing noise. On the Silverstone track {{there appears to be}} two 'retired' cars, one by the pits and one halfway round.|$|E
5000|$|It is a, [...] "humble but infamous hangout is like {{a church}} for wayward souls Whose paths to Heaven are found with {{throttle}} in hand," [...] {{in the words of}} Zapata Espinoza writing for Mountain Bike magazine, [...] "The gathering of the tribe at the Rock Store is unlike any other. There are... <b>over-revving</b> canyon racers in their full-leather regalia, celebrities riding bikes, vintage old-timers on ratty Indians, bourgeois bikers with their chaps and Nike Air-Stupids, dual-sport riders in their MX gear, freaks on V-8 powered trikes - there's even a group of two-wheeled Freemasons. It's a wonderful collection of humanity and two wheels where diversity isn't just tolerated, it's celebrated." ...|$|E

5000|$|Internally, {{the engine}} is {{essentially}} a six-cylinder variant of the EJ22 found in the first-generation Japanese market Legacy and Impreza. The new 3.3-liter variant was equipped with dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, and had an increased compression ratio of 10.1:1, bringing horsepower up to [...] at 5,400 rpm with 309 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm. Fuel delivery was accomplished with sequential multi-port fuel injection with dual spray injectors. Engine ignition used platinum spark plugs and a computerized management system with [...] "limp home feature", which included <b>over-rev</b> protection, monitors fuel injection and ignition.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission also has engine <b>over-rev</b> protection by shifting the transmission {{to the next}} available gear once 6500 rpm has been achieved, even if the gear selector is in a low gear position. The computer that monitors and controls {{automatic transmission}} operations and status is networked with the fuel injection management computer, {{as well as the}} cruise control and anti-lock brake computer, if so equipped. Information is shared so that the vehicle operates as efficiently as possible. The computers that monitored various conditions also have the ability to store occurrences of possible malfunction, and aid qualified mechanics in the diagnosis and possible repair of various systems.|$|R

50|$|Prost won 1985 after polesitter Senna retired with a blown Renault {{engine in}} his Lotus after <b>over-revving</b> {{it at the}} start, and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari retook the lead twice, but he went off the track at Sainte-Devote, where Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Italian Riccardo Patrese had a huge {{accident}} only a few laps previously and oil and debris littered the track. Prost passed Alboreto, who retook the Frenchman, and then he punctured a tire after running over bodywork debris from the Piquet/Patrese accident, which dropped him to 4th. He was able to pass his Roman countrymen Andrea De Cesaris and Elio de Angelis, but finished 2nd behind Prost. The French Prost dominated 1986 after starting from pole position, a race where the Nouvelle Chicane had been changed {{on the grounds of}} safety.|$|E
5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this extra loading on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} <b>over-revving</b> the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|E
50|$|Last year's winners, the No.1 Land Motorsport-Porsche (Gabriel Abergel-Xavier Pompidou-Carsten Tilke-Otto Klohs) were sidelined as {{well after}} Tilke had <b>over-revved</b> the engine. Almost {{at the same}} time, the number 148-AF Corse Ferrari (Robert Kaufmann-Michael Waltrip-Marcos Ambrose-Rui Águas-Niki Cadei) became {{involved}} in a collision with the car of NASCAR-star Michael Waltrip, who was in his first-ever 24-hour race in Dubai. Michael Waltrip couldn't avoid the collision when the other car started swerving in front of him. The Ferrari F430 also incurred considerable damage and retired. Up {{to the time of}} the accident, the car had always been in the top ten, running as high as sixth.|$|R
25|$|In 1916 it was {{suggested}} by naval planners to bring the CC-class submarines to the east coast. During 1917 that became a reality as the Admiralty ordered the two subs and Shearwater to Europe. On 21 June 1917 the three ships left Esquimalt. Off Cape Blanco, the fleet ran into a gale and CC-2 rolled heavily in the seas, seawater contaminating the sub's batteries. Half the crew was incapacitated by chlorine gas. The high seas also caused the propellers on both the submarines to be tossed out of the water, in turn causing the engines to <b>over-rev.</b> The stabilisation of this problem later caused the battery cells to start to break down and eventually short-circuit and start electrical fires.|$|R
50|$|Determined, Capeta, in {{his first}} time on a race track, manages to not only master the mangled racer, but also catches and {{attempts}} to overtake Naomi Minamoto (Minamoto Naomi) on the inside line, a talented young racer who drives for a works karting team, Endless Autohouse Racing. This overtaking maneuver shocks Naomi {{so much so that}} he drops the accelerator of his kart, accelerates past Capeta. This infuriates his mother and team manager, Nanako Minamoto (Minamoto Nanako), as he <b>over-revved</b> a brand new engine which {{he was supposed to be}} merely running in. Nobu Andou and Monami Suzuki, Capeta's best friends, support him in his karting - Nobu as his technical assistant/manager and Monami as the self-appointed team manager.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} ability to be driven {{for longer periods of time}} and the use of burning fuel, {{mechanical}} wear in nitro vehicles is generally greater than in electric vehicles. In addition, the increased weight of fuel-powered vehicles generally lead to higher speed collisions, causing greater damage to the collided vehicles, and a greater degree of safety concerns needs to be taken into account. Maintenance such as cleaning of the air filter and general chassis cleaning, replacement of worn clutch parts, proper after-run lubrication (necessary for storage) and maintenance of other motor-related items such as glow plug replacement makes for a more frustrating experience for first time RC users. In addition, nitro motors typically require rebuilding or replacement after 2-8 gallons (7-30 liters) of fuel run through them, due to loss of compression, which can be accelerated by poor tuning and overheating. It is also possible to seriously damage the engines by <b>over-revving</b> them with no load or ingestion of dirt into the carburetor. As such, nitro-powered vehicles are by nature expensive to maintain.|$|E
50|$|In April 1954, after {{securing}} the co-starring role of Cal Trask in East of Eden, James Dean purchased a 1955 Triumph Tiger T110 650 cc motorcycle and, later, a used red 1953 MG TD Midget sports car. In March 1955, Dean traded the MG {{for a new}} 1955 Porsche Super Speedster purchased from Competition Motors in Hollywood, California. He traded the Triumph T110 for a 1955 Triumph TR5 Trophy three days after filming wrapped on East of Eden. Just before filming began on Rebel Without a Cause, Dean competed in the Palm Springs Road Races with the Speedster on March 26-27. He finished first overall in Saturday's novice class, and second overall in the Sunday main event. Dean also raced the Speedster at Bakersfield on May 1-2, finishing first in class and third overall. His final race with the Speedster was at Santa Barbara on Memorial Day, May 30, where he started in the eighteenth position, {{worked his way up}} to fourth, before <b>over-revving</b> his engine and blowing a piston. He did not finish the race.|$|E
50|$|The {{connecting}} rod is under tremendous stress from the reciprocating load {{represented by the}} piston, actually stretching and being compressed with every rotation, and the load increases as {{the square of the}} engine speed increase. Failure of a {{connecting rod}}, usually called throwing a rod, {{is one of the most}} common causes of catastrophic engine failure in cars, frequently putting the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby rendering the engine irreparable; it can result from fatigue near a physical defect in the rod, lubrication failure in a bearing due to faulty maintenance, or from failure of the rod bolts from a defect, improper tightening or <b>over-revving</b> of the engine. In an unmaintained, dirty environment, a water or chemical emulsifies with the oil that lubricates the bearing and causes the bearing to fail. Re-use of rod bolts is a common practice as long as the bolts meet manufacturer specifications. Despite their frequent occurrence on televised competitive automobile events, such failures are quite rare on production cars during normal daily driving. This is because production auto parts have a much larger factor of safety, and often more systematic quality control.|$|E

5000|$|The 5.8 {{engine is}} {{formally}} {{known as the}} Trinity Engine or 5.8-liter V8. The 5.8 L benefits from cylinder heads with improved coolant flow, Ford GT camshafts, piston-cooling oil jets {{similar to those found}} on the 5.0 Coyote, new 5-layer MLS head gaskets, an <b>over-rev</b> function that increases the red line to 7000 rpm for up to 8 seconds (from 6250 rpm), and a compression ratio increased to 9.0:1 (from 8.5:1). Displacement is 355 cu. in. (5,812 cc) with a bore diameter of 93.5 mm (3.681 in) and stroke of 105.8 mm (4.165 in). Boost is supplied by a 2.3L TVS supercharger with maximum boost of 14 psi. [...] Trinity has 37.0 mm intake valves and 32.0 mm exhaust valves.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{positive}} review, Allmusics Tim Sendra praised core member John Dwyers songwriting and the albums overal aesthetic, writing: [...] "Dwyer continues to crank out consistently great to amazing songs and albums that overflow with hot-wired guitars, <b>over-revved</b> vocals, and giant, jagged hooks. ... After Drop some {{might have expected}} Thee Oh Sees to continue to explore their softer side, Mutilator Defeated At Last confounds those expectations. Blows them up, really, in a giant fireball of guitars, noise, and psychedelic power." [...] In another positive review Pitchforks Aaron Leitko wrote: [...] "As with Drop, this extra polish and attention benefits Mutilator. There are tasteful psychedelic embellishments—synth wooshes, delay trails—and new instrumentation, like electric organ and acoustic guitar. The fuzz and grime have been peeled back a little, leaving room for more density and detail." ...|$|R
