500|$|Before leaving, Han Solo {{runs into}} Princess Leia, who insists on Han staying with her. Apologizing to Leia for {{having to leave}} her, Han gives her his e-mail address, which is hosted by the nearly defunct company CompuServe at [...] "hansolo64@compuserve.com." [...] Han Solo then {{questions}} why Leia wants him to stay, and suggests that she is afraid that she will not get a [...] "goodbye kiss" [...] before he leaves. Leia then mulls over the thought, and tells him that she would rather kiss Star Trek actor George Takei. Abruptly entering, C-3PO and R2-D2 alert Han Solo of Luke Skywalker's disappearance. Han goes out to look for Luke on his [...] "Dondon", which has {{the body of a}} tauntaun, {{and the head of the}} late actor Don Knotts. Once Han locates Luke, the late comedian Rodney Dangerfield appears, to which Han responds, [...] "There are way too many elderly comedians <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the snow." [...] Before being rescued, Han first appears in a 1980s commercial for the chewing gum Juicy Fruit, with the original audio from the commercial and Juicy Fruit's current logo. The sequence was originally planned for the fifth season episode [...] "Road to Rupert", with Stewie and Brian taking the place of Peter.|$|E
500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} make some changes and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm going to make some {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I want to see some places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E

[...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E
2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there. He said, ‘You’ve {{got to make a}} film in Antarctica. It’s just like <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> the wasteland. It’s spectacular.’ And that always stuck in my head.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The imprint {{will not}} publish books written by Riordan, [...] "whose role will {{be closer to}} curator".

If I feel like I can recommend them ... we’re going to have them <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the spotlight." [...] A focus will be placed on [...] "diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans, without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.|$|E
