5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with {{passages}} totaling about , {{formed in}} marble. The parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes {{that created the}} Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E

5|$|The caves are {{the site}} of the first cave dives in Britain which were {{undertaken}} by Jack Sheppard and Graham Balcombe. Since the 1930s divers have explored the extensive network of chambers developing breathing apparatus and novel techniques in the process. The full extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> system is still unknown with approximately , including 25 chambers, having been explored. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by Herbert E. Balch. As a tourist attraction it has been owned by Madame Tussauds and, most recently, the circus owner Gerry Cottle. The cave is noted for the Witch of Wookey Hole– a roughly human shaped stalagmite that legend says is a witch turned to stone by a monk from Glastonbury. It has also been used as a location for film and television productions.|$|E

5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> where the witch was hiding.

5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached {{even in the absence of}} any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E

In 1901, he led a team of miners and cavers to dig into Swildon's Hole, where he found the 'Forty Foot Pot' as well as chambers full of stalagmites. Despite the publicity around the find, Balch refused to disclose the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> as he believed it was too dangerous for amateur explorers. The farmer who owned the land denied them entrance the following year, turning the valley into a fish farm, so the team headed upstream where they discovered Eastwater Cavern, one of Balch's personal favourites.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance.

The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cave</b> of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E

5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which {{were collected in}} a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and described as a new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and some material that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. As usual in Hipposideros, the second upper premolar is small and displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E
