50|$|The ECJ {{held that}} {{although}} the worker has the burden of proof, this cannot undermine enforcement of equal pay. Therefore when statistics show an appreciable difference between jobs of equal value, the burden passes to the employer to <b>objectively</b> <b>justify</b> the disparity.|$|R
5000|$|... is a UK {{labour law}} case, {{concerning}} {{the test for}} when the continued used of a fixed term contract is <b>objectively</b> <b>justified,</b> and when employees are covered by employment rights during work abroad. The case was joined with Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families v Fletcher.|$|R
40|$|In April 2010, the 'Default Retirement Age' was repealed. This had {{permitted}} {{employers to}} retire most workers at 65, thus legitimizing blatant age discrimination. Those approaching retirement age, arguably {{most in need}} of protection from age discrimination, may have welcomed the repeal. However, employers may still force workers to retire, but this time they must <b>objectively</b> <b>justify</b> the retirement. The ECJ has directed that an employer's objective justification must accord with expressed government social policy, which was changed radically by the Coalition Government, and now appears to be out of step with other ECJ and Court of Appeal pronouncements on compulsory retirement. Thus, litigants must scour various government statements for a social policy, and then decide if it can be reconciled with precedent, and any parallel claim for unfair dismissal. This article explores and speculates when an employer may succeed in <b>objectively</b> <b>justifying</b> compulsory retirement...|$|R

50|$|However, the {{majority}} of their Lordships were agreed {{that there had been a}} sufficient objective justification by the government, namely encouraging recruitment by employers, to pass the 1985 Order. This resulted from the broad margin of discretion that governments had to implement social policy to achieve a legitimate aim. Yet it was emphasised that experience may change whether a measure is <b>objectively</b> <b>justified.</b> Lord Nicholls concluded in the following way.|$|R

40|$|Although the {{international}} community has addressed whether environmental harm violates human rights norms, only recently has it asked whether international organizations must implement those norms. That changed when Greenland posited that the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has a duty to implement aboriginal subsistence whaling (ASW) in light of customary international human rights norms, including the rights to cultural identity and resources. This article explains why international organizations have an obligation to implement customary international human rights law. Implementation, however, may be challenging because the content of some rights is not clear. In addition, these rights are not absolute. Actions may interfere with human rights provided they can be reasonably and <b>objectively</b> <b>justified,</b> as the United Nations Human Rights Committee has concluded, or are necessary, legitimate, and proportional, as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has stated. The article concludes that the IWC’s ASW management regime interferes with certain customary international human rights, but that it can be reasonably and <b>objectively</b> <b>justified</b> or is necessary, legitimate, and proportional. Nonetheless, the IWC could strengthen implementation of human rights by, for example, clearly articulating criteria for preparing and evaluating “need statements”—the statements submitted to support an ASW quota...|$|R

50|$|Each {{test has}} its own {{indications}} and contraindications. An indication is a <b>valid</b> medical <b>reason</b> to perform the test. A contraindication is a <b>valid</b> medical <b>reason</b> to reject the test. For example, a basic cholesterol test may be indicated (medically appropriate) for a middle-aged person. However, if the same test was performed on that person very recently, then {{the existence of the}} previous test is a contraindication for the test (a medically <b>valid</b> <b>reason</b> to not perform it).|$|R

40|$|The CJEU's Achbita and Bougnaoui {{decisions}} on workplace bans of Islamic headscarves are disappointing {{as they are}} not providing enough guidance to the national courts concerning the criteria {{that they need to}} take into consideration in their attempts to find a balance between the rights in conflict. The judgments do not provide any criteria for the admissibility of dress codes other than that they should be neutral and <b>objectively</b> <b>justified.</b> Even those terms though are not analysed by the court in a sufficient manner...|$|R
5000|$|It {{requires}} an objective {{balance between the}} discriminatory effect of the condition and the reasonable needs of the party who applies the condition…. the employer had to show a real need {{on the part of}} the undertaking, <b>objectively</b> <b>justified,</b> although that need was not confined to economic grounds; it might, for instance, include administrative efficiency in a concern not engaged in commerce or business. Clearly it may, as in the present case, be possible to justify by reference to grounds other than economic or administrative efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Mangold was a 56-year-old German man {{employed}} on a {{fixed term}} contract in a permanent full-time job. The German government introduced the so-called Employment Promotion Act 1996 (Beschäftigungsförderungsgesetz) which allowed fixed term contracts for a two-year maximum, and otherwise were unlawful unless they could be <b>objectively</b> <b>justified.</b> But even this protection was removed (apparently to [...] "promote employment") if the employee was over 60. Further amendments then changed the age to 52. Mr Mangold claimed {{that the lack of}} protection, over age 52, was unjustified age discrimination.|$|R

It involves {{the application of}} a provision, criterion or practice to everyone, which has a disproportionate effect on some people and is not <b>objectively</b> <b>justified.</b> For instance, a requirement that applicants for a job be over a certain height would have a greater impact on women than on men, as the average height of women is lower than that of men. It is a defence for the employer to show that the requirement is “a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”.|$|R

The {{contracts}} were limited to nine years, or exceptionally ten years under the Regulations for Members of the Seconded Staff of the European Schools 1996. The Secretary of State claimed {{it was not for}} the court of one member state to question the Regulations, or that the nine year rule was <b>objectively</b> <b>justified.</b> The Secretary of State also contended that Duncombe was not covered because he was outside the UK.|$|R
