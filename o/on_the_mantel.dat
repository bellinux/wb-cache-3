5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel,</b> and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{lasted from}} August 1919 to May 1921. The general {{contractor}} was W.O. Heckart of Eugene. Washington Brick of Spokane did the brick, Rushlight and Hastorf did the heating, City Iron Works in Portland did the ironwork, and Standard Artificial Stone Company of Portland did the cast stone. <b>The</b> carvines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and <b>the</b> grand stairway {{were based on}} designs done by students in the Art Department and Professor Larry Schroff did the over-mantel paintings ...|$|R
6000|$|Two of our neighbors--two capable women, came in {{next morning}} to help, {{and in a few}} hours the windows were curtained, the linen laid out and the turkey in the oven. Under Zulime's hands the rooms bloomed into homeliness. The kitchen things fell into orderly array. Pictures took their places <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls, little knick-knacks which had been brought from the city were set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and bookcases, and when our guests arrived they each and all exclaimed, [...] "No one would ever know you'd had a fire!" ...|$|R
50|$|These {{colors were}} {{often used in}} other homes of the late 1700s and early 1800s. The only {{difference}} between how these colors were used in this home versus how they are used in other homes of the time {{is the way in}} which they are distributed. Most homes of the Federal period would concentrate colors in one room, giving a house a red room, blue room, etc. However, in the Vann House the colors have been mixed in almost every room, for a multi-color appearance, as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantels,</b> doorjambs, and wainscottings, all of which are original to the house.|$|R
25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> in his home.|$|E
2500|$|A bright {{fire was}} {{burning in the}} grate, casting golden patches that danced over the ceiling and the walls. The room was thus {{illuminated}} by a brilliant, vacillating glow which dimmed the lamp set on a table. Madame Raquin had tried to arrange the room attractively, all white and scented, as though {{to serve as a}} nest for young lovers; the old shopkeeper had chosen to add to the bed a few bits of lace and to fill the vases <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> with big bouquets of roses. A gentle warmth lingered in the air, with soft odors.|$|E
2500|$|New {{characters}} in the 2007 Christmas special include Emmeridge, the outspoken butler replacing Brabinger; Adam fforbes-Hamilton, Marton's nephew and Audrey's godson, who has recently moved to Grantleigh {{to learn how to}} run an estate; and Archie Pennington-Booth, a neighbouring landowner driven to bankruptcy by [...] "Farmer Tom". Marjory lives in the Old Lodge, and she develops a crush on Adam. A small acknowledgement of Bertie and Brabinger appears in the special, consisting of a photo of Brabinger and a small beagle statuette on a side table. Richard's mother, aka [...] "Mrs. Poo," [...] is acknowledged by a marble headstone in the church graveyard and a framed photograph <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> of the manor's sitting room.|$|E
60|$|He bathed {{his face}} and took a drink of water, and then all three began to {{speculate}} upon the next probable movement of the Comanches. By <b>the</b> clock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> living-room <b>mantel</b> it was now half-past four.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{internal}} {{features of}} this snug abode were a wide fireplace, enormous cupboards, a brown settle, and several sketches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>mantel,</b> done in outline with {{the point of a}} hot poker--the subjects mainly consisting of old men walking painfully erect, with a curly-tailed dog behind.|$|R
2500|$|During the Clinton administration, the faux {{white marble}} finish painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> and baseboards in the 1960s was removed {{to reveal the}} {{original}} [...] "rouge antique" [...] (reddish) marble from Vermont installed during the White House's renovation in 1951. Although the East Room's oak floors had been bare since 1903, three matching $259,330 wool carpets were installed in February 1995. These carpets, ordered in 1990, were designed to reflect the plaster ceiling moldings created during the John Quincy Adams administration in the late 1820s. Woven by Edward Fields Inc. of New York and paid for with private donations raised by the White House Endowment Fund, the carpets were designed to cover most of the floor {{to protect it from}} dirt and the occasional pebble stuck in the tread of a shoe.|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{furniture}} in the East Room was removed by Boudin to make the room appear to be of a single historic era. The 1902 console tables {{were removed from the}} piers between the windows, and the 1902 Louis XVI style floor lamps moved out of the corners and in front of the piers. The 1952 Adam-style camelback sofas were removed at the instigation of du Pont, and replaced with gilt benches. Research conducted by White House Curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce and Jacqueline Kennedy identified the four Monroe-era candelabra (which had been moved), and restored them to <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> in <b>the</b> room's southern wall. Early 19th-century crystal candelabra (of an indeterminate manufacture) were placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantels</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> room's northern wall. To compliment the paintings of George and Martha Washington, Jacqueline Kennedy was loaned portraits of a young Bushrod Washington (George Washington's nephew and an Associate Supreme Court Justice) and his wife, Julia Ann Blackburn Washington. These portraits by Chester Harding were hung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east wall. Kennedy's friend, Jayne Wrightsman, donated two early 19th-century wall sconces, which were wired for electricity by White House staff and hung {{on either side of the}} center window.|$|R
50|$|In Great Britain, Hogarth's set of {{paintings}} forming a melodramatic morality tale titled Marriage à la Mode, engraved in 1745, shows the parade rooms of a stylish London house, {{in which the}} only rococo is in plasterwork of the salon's ceiling. Palladian architecture is in control. Here, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kentian <b>mantel,</b> <b>the</b> crowd of Chinese vases and mandarins are satirically rendered as hideous little monstrosities, and the Rococo wall clock is a jumble of leafy branches.|$|R
5000|$|Hendreary Clock - Arrietty's uncle. He was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{fireplace}} <b>mantel</b> when <b>the</b> maid came to {{dust and}} attempted to pass himself off as a knick-knack but sneezed when he was dusted.

5000|$|Although {{initially}} placed {{beneath the}} Christmas tree, {{by the early}} 19th century a family's [...] "putz" [...] might have also been found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fireplace <b>mantel,</b> side tables, and other prominent places within the home. These expanded scenes might include other stories from the Bible. The story of Noah's Ark, an especially popular subject for a putz, {{could result in the}} arranging of several hundred carved animals wending their way towards the ark.|$|R
60|$|Father {{laughed at}} her this July till his fluffy hair shook like a dog's ears in fly-time. He pounded his fist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prim center-table by which Mother had been solemnly reading the picture-captions in the Eternity Filmco's Album of Funny Film Favorites. The statuettes of General Lafayette and Mozart <b>on</b> <b>the</b> false <b>mantel</b> shook with his lusty thumping. He roared till his voice filled the living-room and hollowly echoed in the {{porcelain}} sink in the kitchen.|$|R
50|$|Mantel clocks—or shelf clocks—are {{relatively}} small house clocks traditionally placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shelf, or <b>mantel,</b> above <b>the</b> fireplace. The form, first developed in France in the 1750s, {{can be distinguished}} from earlier chamber clocks of similar size {{due to a lack}} of carrying handles.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Donovan grinned in {{appreciation}} of this thrust, helped himself liberally {{from the bottle}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel,</b> and took {{a seat on the}} bed. We had a [...] "friendly chat." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the luxury of Francis in plate 8, Thomas and his companion are shown living in complete squalor somewhere in London. The sole article of furniture {{in the room is}} the broken down bed that Tom and his woman are lying on. She is busy examining the various nonmonetary spoils from his thefts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highway, including an earring that looks like a gallows. <b>The</b> bottles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fireplace <b>mantel</b> are suggestive of venereal disease, similar to those of plate 3 in A Harlot's Progress.|$|R
50|$|The Fisher-Richardson House is set {{close to}} {{the north side of}} Willow Street in a {{residential}} area of central Mansfield. It is a 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure, six bays wide, with a gambrel wood shingle roof, two internal chimneys, and clapboard siding. The front facade bays are irregularly spaced, with the door set right of center. The interior features wide pine floors, ceilings with exposed beams, and beaded paneling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. <b>Mantels</b> and some other features are recreations made as part of the 1930 restoration.|$|R
60|$|By noon {{they had}} reached Voiron, and here, at a quiet hostelry, they descended to pause awhile for rest and refreshment. It was a chill, blustering day, and {{although}} the rain held off, the heavens were black {{with the promise of}} more to come. There was a fire burning in the general-room of the hostelry, and Garnache went to warm him at its cheerful blaze. Moodily he stood there, one hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high <b>mantel</b> shelf, one foot upon an andiron, his eyes upon the flames.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE (glancing at {{the clock}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel).</b> I haven't got time to tell you,--I'm afraid I couldn't make it clear, anyway,--it isn't clear {{in my own mind}} yet. But,--go slow with this labour business, dad, there's {{dynamite}} in it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} pipe {{from his mouth}} and laid it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel,</b> then stood irresolute a moment (unconsciously, from old habit, {{thrusting}} his hands where his pantaloons pockets should have been, and meditatively dropping his chin on his breast), and finally said: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} pause. In {{the stillness}} the ticking of a clock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mantel</b> became audible. Then there was a laugh in the ante-room, where a {{professional}} brother of Jack's had been waiting, slightly {{under the influence of}} grief and liquor.|$|E

5000|$|... ==== Frieze ==== The {{triangle}} (white, {{blue and}} green) frieze that today is seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tympanum <b>mantel</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main façade of the villa is a copy made in 1986 {{by the manufacturer}} Richard Ginori, while the original is in a room <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first floor of the}} villa. This work is 14 meters long and 22 feet long, 58 centimeters long, of uncertain attribution and dating. It is principally attributed to Andrea Sansovino regarding the construction phase of Lorenzo il Magnifico, as It refers to the theme of the return to the Age of gold, or performed by Giuliano da Sangallo or Bertoldo. Two phases, the second of which ended at the time of Leo X.|$|R
50|$|Some authors, such as N.N Vasu, have {{depicted}} Odia Vaishnavism as 'Buddhist-Vaishnavism', {{since it}} does not accept Ramanuja's Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy (11th century), nor does it adhere to orthodox Gaudiya Vaishnavism created in the 16th century. Other scholars, such as Prabhat Mukerjee, have denied these claims supporting the different varieties of Vaishnava philosophy. Scholars debate {{the influence of the}} Panchasakha from the original Vaishnava Agama (Pancharatras) while others source their ideas in Sahajayana Buddhism, and the Natha sampradaya. Both the Sahajayana Buddhists and the Panchasakha worshipped the image of Jagannatha as the Buddha, though the Panchasakhas saw Jagannatha as an incarnation of Vishnu as seen in <b>the</b> Dasāvatara image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>mantel</b> of <b>the</b> Jagannatha Temple.|$|R
