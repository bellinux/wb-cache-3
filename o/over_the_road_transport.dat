Its responsibilities included the exercise of public authority <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> sector and the planning, building, operation, and maintenance of the national road network. The authority was organized into a head office and seven regional offices (a structure that has largely survived its subsumption into the Swedish Transport Administration in 2010). In 2003 the SRA introduced “customer-oriented” working processes—its work management system was adapted, the better to guide the SRA {{in the direction of}} what they termed greater “customer benefit”. New strategic posts were created with responsible for disseminating users’ wishes across the organization {{and to make sure that}} they were taken into account at the planning stage, and strategic and measurable goals for “customer orientation” were defined.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper explores how the {{automobile}} industries in Japan, Europe and the U.

In order to pursue these research questions, this paper hypothesize that automobile industries exercise Agency within (or together with) their home states, in order to reflect their preferences/interests <b>over</b> <b>the</b> post- 2012 <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> institutional architecture. As {{a result of the}} examination drawn from the case studies, conclusions are twofold: first, Japanese automobile industry exercises Agency within its home states while European industry does not, thus there are varieties of types/patterns of Agency may exist according to countries; second, Japan and the Europe – the two nations with high levels of fuel economy standards – are pursuing to reflect their preferences <b>over</b> <b>the</b> post- 2012 <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> framework in different ways, the one is the hybrid of Asian Pacific Partnership (APP) and UN oriented track pursued by Japan, and the other is UN-oriented track pursued by Europe. <b>The</b> future <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> climate policy <b>over</b> <b>the</b> post- 2012 Architecture is heavily depends on which tracks the U.

40|$|The world {{energy crisis}} {{and global warming}} call for a {{reduction}} of energy consumption. High speed rail, increasingly viewed as an effective solution to inter-city passenger transportation challenge of the 21 st century, has the significant ability of increasing passenger capacity and reducing journey time. The advent of high speed rail provided many research opportunities. So far studies have been contributed from different perspectives: economical, environmental, and technical. The main research gaps are: addressing {{the problem of the}} effects of route geometry on train energy consumption and quantifying the contributing factors towards differences in energy consumption between different types of high speed trains. In addition, this energy assessment cannot be based solely on the energy consumption in the operation phase. In the life cycle assessment of the whole railway system, the vehicle evaluation is relatively straightforward, but the infrastructure raises many difficult issues. In this thesis, an existing approach for modelling the traction energy of electric trains is developed and extended to simulate the train operation under different driving strategies. Baseline simulation is carried out to estimate the journey time and energy consumption of a High Speed 2 (HS 2) reference train running on the London-Birmingham proposed high speed route. The influence of route geometry and train configuration on energy consumption is investigated, based on the metric of energy consumption per passenger kilometre. Simulations are also carried out of different types of high speed rolling stock running on the proposed HS 2 route, to identify the key areas of vehicle design which help to minimise the energy consumption of high speed rail travel. The life cycle assessment of railway infrastructure is carried out in four stages of a whole life cycle: production, operation, maintenance and disposal, the influence of route parameters on life cycle cost is also investigated. Finally, high speed rail is compared with competing modes of transport, i. e. the aircraft, the automobile and the conventional train, in both operational energy efficiency and whole life cycle analysis. The high speed rail transportation has great advantage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and air <b>transport,</b> giving a reduction of carbon emission by roughly 95...|$|R
