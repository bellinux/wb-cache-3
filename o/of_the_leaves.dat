5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies {{have been named}} based on characteristics such as the hairiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> {{the extent to which}} the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal umbel.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E
5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of {{the areas of the}} leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and crinkling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> in infected plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} is {{native to}} northern Europe and Asia. It was cultivated in Russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements. Cultivation in Europe {{is thought to have}} started around the last decades of the 17th century. Decoction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> bark or roots was also used as traditional remedies.|$|E
5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E

5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses {{have been described}} as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|Botanists in the 20th century {{recognised}} B.oblongifolia as {{a species}} in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia {{as it was the}} oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B.paludosa, B.integrifolia or even B.marginata.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> aminolysis <b>of</b> phenacyl {{bromides}} (YC 6 H 4 COCH 2 Br) with benzylamines (XC 6 H 4 CH 2 NH 2) in acetonitrile, the Brönsted βX (βnuc) values observed {{are rather}} low (βX = 0. 69 - 0. 73). These values {{are similar to}} those (βX ≅ 0. 7) for other aminolysis reactions of phenacyl compounds with anilines and pyridines, but are much smaller than those (βX = 1. 1 - 2. 5) for <b>the</b> aminolysis <b>of</b> esters with benzylamines which are believed to proceed stepwise with rate-limiting expulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group. <b>The</b> relative constancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> βX values (βX 0. 7) irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amine, <b>leaving</b> group and solvent can be accounted for by a bridged type transition state in <b>the</b> rate-limiting expulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group. Thus <b>the</b> aminolysis <b>of</b> phenacyl derivatives are proposed to proceed stepwise through a zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate (T±), with rate-limiting expulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group from T±.

5|$|It {{closely resembles}} its relative, the Moreton Bay fig (F.macrophylla). Having similar ranges in the wild, {{they are often}} confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves).</b> This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs on the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E

5|$|The single {{leafless}} stem or scape, appearing {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The {{same could be said}} for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
