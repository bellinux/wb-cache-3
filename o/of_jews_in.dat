The Paradesi Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth. Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Gustaf Wallenberg (born 4 August 1912, death date unknown) was a Swedish architect, businessman, diplomat and humanitarian. He {{is widely}} celebrated for saving tens of {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Nazi-occupied Hungary during the Holocaust from German Nazis and Hungarian Fascists during the later stages of World War II. While serving as Sweden's special envoy in Budapest between July and December 1944, Wallenberg issued protective passports and sheltered Jews in buildings designated as Swedish territory.|$|E
5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna came {{to be seen as a}} prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|After {{violations}} of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neopaganism and racial superiority. The Church condemned the 1939 invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein. While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> the Holocaust, the Church has also been accused of encouraging centuries of antisemitism and {{not doing enough to}} stop Nazi atrocities.|$|E

5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution <b>of</b> <b>Jews.</b> <b>In</b> particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E
5|$|In December 1905 a mass {{meeting was}} held at the synagogue to protest massacres <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Russia and mourn their deaths, and the {{congregation}} donated $500 to a fund for the sufferers. In March 1909 Orthodox groups held meetings there to organize opposition to the constitution and make-up of Judah Leon Magnes's Kehilla, an overarching organization intended to represent all of New York's Jews, which lasted until 1922. A mass meeting of local residents and businessmen to combat Lower East Side gangsters {{was held at}} the synagogue in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Jews {{were also}} a native {{religious}} group to the Islands during the Venetian period. They were even fewer in number than the Catholics; in 1797 the number <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Corfu {{appears to have been}} only two thousand. Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{resources}} {{were required to}} construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park just behind the castle. As part of the project, the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence {{was built in the}} town instead, although it is possible that this church also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta {{and other}} Africans in London; {{he became the}} honorary {{secretary}} of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia's monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa to the treatment <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Nazi Germany. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, Heydrich {{was assassinated}} in Prague in an {{operation}} led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive. During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>in</b> Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E
