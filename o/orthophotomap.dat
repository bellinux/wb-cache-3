40|$|We {{elaborated}} a {{new method}} for observing water surface areas and river stages using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It {{is based on}} processing multitemporal five <b>orthophotomaps</b> produced from the UAV-taken visible light images of nine sites of the river, acquired with a sufficient overlap in each part. Water surface areas are calculated in the first place, and subsequently expressed as fractions of total areas of water-covered terrain at a given site of the river recorded on five dates. The logarithms of the fractions are later calculated, producing five samples, each consisted of nine elements. In order to detect statistically significant increments of water surface areas between two <b>orthophotomaps,</b> we apply the asymptotic and bootstrapped versions of the Student's t  test, preceded by other tests that aim to check model assumptions. The procedure is applied to five <b>orthophotomaps</b> covering nine sites of the Ścinawka river (south-western (SW) Poland). The data have been acquired during the experimental campaign, at which flight settings were kept unchanged over nearly 3 years (2012 – 2014). We have found {{that it is possible}} to detect transitions between water surface areas associated with all characteristic water levels (low, mean, intermediate and high stages). In addition, we infer that the identified transitions hold for characteristic river stages as well. In the experiment we detected all increments of water level: (1)  from low stages to mean, intermediate and high stages; (2)  from mean stages to intermediate and high stages; and (3)  from intermediate stages to high stages. Potential applications of the elaborated method include verification of hydrodynamic models and the associated predictions of high flows as well as monitoring water levels of rivers in ungauged basins...|$|R

In other words, an orthophoto is a simulation of a photograph taken from an infinite distance, looking straight down to nadir.

40|$|With rapid new {{technological}} development {{during the past}} 50 years, aerial photos have been increasingly and commonly used not only in geographic information systems but also in various spatially related applications. Many municipalities and government agencies have constructed aerial photo databases all over the world. Keeping these databases up to date {{is the most important}} part of making them effective so that aerial photo databases are expected to be updated as frequently as possible. However, in practice, some of them are barely updated because of high cost. In case of detecting where changes occur, aerial photo databases could be frequently and partially updated only in the changed areas. In this study, medium spatial resolution imagery is proposed to detect changes. Instead of using aerial photos, medium spatial resolution imagery could be a good alternative because of its wider coverage and lower price than aerial photos. Free accessible Landsat ETM+ and <b>orthophotomaps</b> are used for change detection. In order to compare with 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+, 1 m <b>orthophotomaps</b> are decomposed, segmented, and classified through wavelet transform and object-oriented classification. Although the detected changes are rough, the result shows that the method is quite costeffective and practical. Moreover, it could support decision making for updating aerial photo databases. 1.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{under the}} RS, GIS and GPS technology, data fusion and orthophotomaps of multi-temporal Landsat TM, SPOT, ERS SAR and RADARSAT images are made. Furthermore {{a lot of}} {{information}} on geology and structural deformation is extracted. An <b>orthophotomap</b> is a new type of map accurately corrected for geometry and a composite one with a simplified topographic map. In this study, the authors conduct the data fusion of Landsat TM, SPOT and ERS SAR images. Then, utilizing RSthoMapper vl. 0 software explored by themselves, they make three kinds of orthophotomaps, that is 1 : 250 000 map of Kaixian, 1 : 100 000 map of Baishahe and 1 : 50 000 map of Yunyang respectively. The last one is an <b>orthophotomap</b> of fusion image of TM 453 and SPOT panchromatic band with 10 m ground resolution, and DEM used in the rectification comes from SPOT stereopairs. Applying the 1 : 250 000 <b>orthophotomap</b> of Kaixian and the theory and method of phase-separation analysis of remote sensing information field, geological and structural features are systematically interpreted and the linear and circular structures are quantitatively analyzed. With a synthesizing analysis of the combined folds, faults and related major joint systems, four periods of structural deformation and the resulted deformation fields are determined. As a result, four tectonic stress fields produced successively during the Yanshanian to Himalayan period are recovered. Through the ARSIS fusion of the Landsat TM 4, 5, 3 images and SPOT P images, lots of best image results with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and affluent colors are obtained.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to confirm the {{possibility}} of making largescale orthophotomaps applying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Trimble- UX 5. A planned altitude reference of the studying territory was carried out before to the aerial surveying. The studying territory has been marked with distinctive checkpoints {{in the form of}} triangles (0. 5 × 0. 5 × 0. 2 m). The checkpoints used to precise the accuracy of <b>orthophotomap</b> have been marked with similar triangles. To determine marked reference point coordinates and check-points method of GNSS in real-time kinematics (RTK) measuring has been applied. Projecting of aerial surveying has been done with the help of installed Trimble Access Aerial Imaging, having been used to run out the UX 5. Aerial survey out of the Trimble UX 5 UAV has been done {{with the help of the}} digital camera SONY NEX- 5 R from 200 m and 300 m altitude. These aerial surveying data have been calculated applying special photogrammetric software Pix 4 D. The <b>orthophotomap</b> of the surveying objects has been made with its help. To determine the precise accuracy of the got results of aerial surveying the checkpoint coordinates according to the <b>orthophotomap</b> have been set. The average square error has been calculated according to the set coordinates applying GNSS measurements. A-priori accuracy estimation of spatial coordinates of the studying territory using the aerial surveying data have been calculated: mx= 0. 11 m, my= 0. 15 m, mz= 0. 23 m in the village of Remeniv and mx= 0. 26 m, my= 0. 38 m, mz= 0. 43 m in the town of Vynnyky. The accuracy of determining checkpoint coordinates has been investigated using images obtained out of UAV and the average square error of the reference points. Based on comparative analysis of the got results of the accuracy estimation of the made <b>orthophotomap</b> it can be concluded that the value the average square error does not exceed a-priori accuracy estimation. The possibility of applying Trimble UX 5 UAV for making large-scale orthophotomaps has been investigated. The aerial surveying output data using UAV can be applied for monitoring potentially dangerous for people objects, the state border controlling, checking out the plots of settlements. Thus, it is important to control the accuracy the got results. Having based on the done analysis and experimental researches it can be concluded that applying UAV gives the possibility to find data more efficiently in comparison with the land surveying methods.
