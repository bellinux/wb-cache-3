She eventually consents, and finally finds in the film an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> the cargo as planned. The aliens refuse and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and to detach the command module from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the nineteenth century, the game of {{baseball}} began to evolve from a sport played by amateurs for recreation into a more serious game played by professionals. One of the most dramatic changes was the transition of the pitcher's delivery from an underhand motion to an overhanded throw. Before the American Civil War, the pitcher's role was to initiate the action by offering an underhanded throw to the batter, in much the same way that a basketball referee <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> a jump ball to begin play. Since this type of pitching often caused the batter to hit lazy, foul pop-ups, catchers played their position approximately twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, and wore no protective equipment.|$|E

In her first solo effort, Beyoncé declares herself a singular personality, a body, and a performer. Not to mention a sensation with a hula-hoop." [...] Fuchs added to her comment about Beyoncé's hoola-hooping skills, referring to them as [...] "sensational" [...] and stated that it gave the video [...] "a giddy, gorgeous turn". Tamar Anitai of MTV News negatively reviewed Beyoncé's choice in hair-style as [...] "two-tone, too-tight curls". In 2003, the music video was nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan in the category Best Video from a Film. It eventually lost to Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] from the film 8 Mile.|$|E

500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any {{way you look}} at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns and the introduction of side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile."

500|$|The game's {{story has}} {{received}} {{a considerable amount of}} acclaim from reviewers. GamePro notes that [...] "the intense single-player campaign <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative; there are moments in the game that will send chills down your spine." [...] GameSpot mentioned that the fact the [...] "single-player campaign is over in a flash" [...] as the only major flaw. While IGN described the campaign as [...] "still very linear" [...] like that of its predecessors, [...] "eschewing the concept of sandbox gameplay," [...] it noted that this resulted in [...] "a much richer, more focused experience" [...] with [...] "beautifully scripted set pieces." [...] IGN's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it [...] "virtually plays on a rail, but that's part of its charm." [...] In contrast to later entries in the Call of Duty franchise, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw of Zero Punctuation gave the game a positive review, praising how it [...] "never sacrifices gameplay for story, or vice versa" [...] and that it featured [...] "less of the smarmy, black-and-white, 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee' jingoism that turns me off most war games".|$|E
500|$|Stone Sour {{received}} generally positive reviews. Most reviewers {{offered some}} comparison {{to that of}} vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root's other band Slipknot. While reviewing the album, Don Kaye wrote that [...] "it's rare that a musician <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> another venue for their talents that proves to be equal to their fulltime outfit," [...] stating that Stone Sour is one such case. While Rowan Shaeffer of Counterculture states that [...] "Get Inside" [...] is [...] "the closest to Slipknot that Stone Sour get," [...] even comparing it to the Slipknot single [...] "Left Behind". Citing [...] "the chugging rhythm, manic kick-drums and shout-along vocals" [...] as specific elements that are reminiscent of Slipknot, adding that it was [...] "an obvious choice for a single" [...] as it would not alienate their potential audience of Slipknot fans. Jason D. Taylor noted the similarity in lyrical content to that of Slipknot's; however, he stated that vocalist Taylor comes across as less infuriated which [...] "allows the songs themselves to settle smoothly, yet motivate the listener to feel the emotion". NY Rock stated that the album has a [...] "more balanced feel to it" [...] than that of Slipknot's most recent release at that time, Iowa.|$|E
500|$|Limbo was {{generally}} praised for its puzzle {{design and the}} simplicity of its controls. Jake Gaskill of G4 TV {{was impressed by the}} complexity of the puzzles based on the two simple actions of jumping and grabbing onto objects, similar to LittleBigPlanet, with a variety of elements to assure [...] "you're always facing something new and challenging" [...] during the game. Game Informer Matt Miller commented that part of the success of Limbo is that [...] "every one of these [...] stands alone"; the game accomplishes this in Miller's opinion by varying the elements throughout the game, and preventing the player from getting too accustomed to similar solutions since [...] "everything changes". GameSpy's Ryan Scott believed that the game empowered the player to work through solutions themselves, and its puzzle design, [...] "with its elegant simplicity, <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> what feels like a world of meaningful possibilities". The frequency of death was not considered a distraction from the game; not only were the deaths seen as necessary as part of learning and overcoming each obstacle, but reviewers found the checkpoints where the player would restart to be plentiful throughout the game. Will Freeman of The Guardian praised the game but noted that beyond the [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] of Limbo artwork, the game is [...] "undermined by the title's lack of innovative gameplay", which he says has been seen in earlier platform games.|$|E

500|$|His {{success on}} the field resumed in 1985, where he scored 1,657runs at 75.31, second only to Viv Richards in the {{national}} averages. He also shared a record opening partnership of 351 with Martyn Moxon. In contrast to the poor relations between Boycott and the senior players, many junior {{members of the team}} remember 1985 and 1986 as pleasant times to be around Boycott, who often coached them on their technique. 1986 saw Boycott score 890runs at 52.35, his season cut short by injuries which were becoming more frequent as he passed the age of 45. This season was the first since 1962 that he had not hit an overall total of 1,000runs; he finished eight short in his final match, when he was run out for 61. He advised the then captain to enforce the follow-on, and did not bat again. Since 1984, support for Boycott had waned in light of his slow scoring, multiple injuries and the general atmosphere around him. Both Brian Close and Ray Illingworth increasingly advocated his removal to Yorkshire's committee, and on 23 September 1986 it was confirmed {{that he would not be}} offered a contract for the following year. A few months later, captain David Bairstow, a long term ally of Boycott whose leadership had Boycott's support, was ruled out of the running for captaincy for the following season, which was instead given to Phil Carrick, of whom Boycott disapproved. Boycott paid tribute to the Reform Group in 1987, describing them as [...] "dedicated Yorkshire members with a heartfelt stake in their club." [...] He suggests that Close and Illingworth feared his popularity. Boycott was offered contracts by other counties, including Derbyshire and Glamorgan, but he never took these <b>offers</b> <b>up,</b> nor played professional cricket again. At the time of his retirement he had scored more first-class runs than any other player.|$|E

In October 2011, NME placed it at number 13 on its list [...] "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years". Additionally, in Summer 2012, an advertisement for New York State touting its economic comeback features the piano loop of this song along with Key's voice singing [...] "New York". Complex placed the song at number nine on its list of [...] "The 100 Best Jay-Z Songs" [...] and on number four on its list of [...] "The 25 Best Alicia Keys Songs", noting that the song [...] "has replaced Frank Sinatra's [...] "New York, New York" [...] as the city's go-to anthem, and remains one of Keys' greatest contributions to pop culture". In July 2013, PopMatters placed the song at number six on its list of [...] "The Top 20 Jay-Z Songs to Date", remarking that [...] "Alicia Keys' voice soars through the city night as Hov <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> his typical wit and, in this case, New York authenticity", making the song to become [...] "the unofficial anthem of the most celebrated city in the world".

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it <b>offers</b> <b>up</b> a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
