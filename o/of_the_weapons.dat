5|$|Lansdale had {{security}} {{concerns about the}} head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> laboratory, J.

25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{electricity}} and <b>the</b> claim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> being non-lethal, controversy has sprouted over particular incidents involving <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in general. In essence, controversy has been centered on <b>the</b> justification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in certain instances, and, in some cases, health {{issues that are}} claimed {{to be due to}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{charging}} handle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> {{is based on}} the AR-15 design at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> This is to ensure that cocking <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> does not interfere with any optics mounted onto the Picatinny rail. The weapon's rails are made out of cast steel and <b>the</b> standard <b>weapon</b> overall weighs 2.1 kg. <b>The</b> semi-automatic version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> can be registered as a Short-Barreled Rifle in most states in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Armbrust, the countermass {{counteracts}} <b>the</b> recoil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> upon firing. <b>The</b> countermass consists <b>of</b> shredded plastic, {{which is}} launched out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> {{when it is}} fired. This plastic is rapidly slowed by air resistance, allowing <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> to be fired safely within an enclosed space. In addition, <b>the</b> positioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countermass takes into consideration <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> to ensure good balance for better accuracy.|$|R
5|$|The project {{expenditure}} through 1 October 1945 was $1.845billion, {{equivalent to}} less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons,</b> to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Hurst was re-armed in 1940 {{with two}} 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns and {{a unit of}} the Isle of Wight Rifles was {{stationed}} there, controlled from the Fire Control Needles. Searchlights and two more 6-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed the next year, when the 37-strong detachment was retitled the 129 Coastal Battery Royal Artillery, followed by the installation of Bofors anti-aircraft guns. A tower, called the Director Tower, was built along the west wing. As the war progressed, the weapons were stood down and the battery finally closed in July 1945, with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> being removed after the war.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> {{makes it}} easier to fight mounted opponents, while the blade is still handy enough to use in close combat, as opposed to using a spear which is {{ineffective}} at close range because only the tip can be used to attack, or a sword which makes hurting mounted enemies significantly harder. <b>The</b> greater length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> would also help when fighting more heavily armed opponents, since an attack can be executed with considerably more force due to <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is {{a weapons}} {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> he created {{during the war}} was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them killing each other. The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is able to convince Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Project E {{modifications}} to Valiants commenced at RAE Farnborough in February 1956. Crew training {{was carried out}} with American instructors at RAF Boscombe Down. The planned V-bomber force had now been reduced to 144 aircraft, and it was planned to equip half of them with Project E weapons. The first 28 Valiants were modified by October 1957; the remaining 20 Valiants, along with 24 Vulcans, were ready by January 1959. Under the Project E Memorandum of Understanding, US personnel had custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons.</b> That meant they performed all the tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. The bombs were stored in Secure Storage Areas (SSAs) on the same bases as the bombers which British staff were not permitted to enter. It was therefore impossible to store British and Americans bombs {{together in the same}} SSA. Bomber Command designated RAF Marham, RAF Waddington and RAF Honington as bases with US SSAs. Another three sites had British SSAs. US custody created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra ten minutes to the bombers' reaction time, and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired.|$|E

5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons.</b> They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The mace or club {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} types of weapons. The {{popularity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> with Vishnu worshippers may have led to its depiction with the deity. The gada – a symbol of strength – was a common weapon for hand-to-hand combat and was regarded as the strongest of weapons. Vishnu's attributes originate from his avatars, Rama and Krishna, the heroes of the ancient Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata (existing in the 5th to 4th century BCE) respectively. Both the epics narrate various characters – gods, men and demons alike – using the gada.|$|E

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, {{as well as how}} to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the interregnum, Ludlow Castle {{continued}} to be run by Parliamentarian governors, the first being the military commander Samuel More. There was a Royalist plot to retake the castle in 1648, but no other military activity took place. The most valuable items in the castle were removed shortly after the siege, and the remainder of the luxurious furnishings were sold off in the town in 1650. The castle was initially kept garrisoned, but in 1653, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> in the castle were removed on the grounds of security and sent to Hereford, then in 1655 the garrison was disbanded altogether. In 1659, the political instability in the Commonwealth government led to the castle being regarrisoned by 100 men under the command of William Botterell.|$|E
