5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from {{the explosion of the}} SN 1987A supernova.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{weeks after}} the {{incident}} with the ambulance, Mac is in a coma and Guy has been suspended from his job. Caroline is {{spending too much time}} with Mac, in Sue's opinion, and tries to stop her from seeing him. During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's semen to make herself pregnant. Mac then comes out of his coma, but is suffering from memory loss and cannot remember his new-found love for Caroline. Angela soon leaves the hospital in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a career in television. With Angela gone, Guy becomes Caroline's new lodger.|$|E
5|$|The North West Development Agency used a {{compulsory}} purchase <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{control of the}} main site in 2003. This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards {{the restoration of the}} complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.|$|E

5|$|The various {{worlds that}} Sora explores often have an {{optional}} party character {{from the film}} on which the world is based. Such party members include Fa Mulan, the woman who passes as a man in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her ailing father's place in the army; Jack Sparrow, a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl; Simba, the self-exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land; and Tron, a security program in Hollow Bastion's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of Dragoon and support the initial landings, {{preliminary}} commando operations had to be carried out. The first target was the Hyères Islands, specifically Port-Cros and Levant. The guns of the German garrisons on both islands could reach the proposed Allied landing area and the sea lanes that the troops would follow. The First Special Service Force, a joint U.S.-Canadian special forces unit trained in amphibious assault and mountaineering and consisting of three regiments, received the <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the islands as part of Operation Sitka.|$|E
5|$|While {{the actual}} pitched battle was short, the French infantry, under Marshal Marmont, {{and most of}} all the cavalry, under General Emmanuel de Grouchy, {{launched}} a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy. Retreating in slow-moving square formations in broad daylight and along some excellent cavalry terrain, the Coalition forces suffered very heavy losses, with several squares broken by the French cavalry. At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his remaining forces to safety.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was {{translated}} to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V. Pope Martin delegated authority to Robert de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Lichton's oath to the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese, a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: {{he seems to have}} thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in career, the stalker (Doug Hutchison) catches up with Black, {{kidnapping}} Catherine. Black is able to track them down and rescue Catherine, stabbing the stalker {{to death in the}} process. Disturbed by both the abduction and Black's rage, Catherine moves out of their family home with Jordan for a time. Before they can reconcile, Catherine dies in a virus outbreak orchestrated by the Millennium Group, who Black discovers are attempting to control the possibility {{of the end of the}} world at the turn of the millennium. Disgusted by the group's motives and actions, Black breaks rank and returns to work with the FBI in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them down.|$|E

5|$|In November 1992, President Yeltsin {{handed the}} two {{recorder}} containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, {{but not the}} tapes themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL007 investigation in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the newly released information into account. The tapes were handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over {{at the same time}} were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military. The tapes were transcribed by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it easy to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, {{he stopped}} in Riobamba, {{where a group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Woodruff decided {{to travel to}} England in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the second half of}} the FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no {{guarantee}} of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return home and work. Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.|$|E
5|$|The 1924–25 season marked Nelson's {{return to}} the Football League Third Division North {{following}} their relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the previous campaign. It was the club's fourth season in the Football League, having previously competed in the Central League. Former Scotland international defender David Wilson retired from his player-manager role in the summer of 1924 in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the managerial post full-time. Thomas Jacques, who had played for Nelson during their inaugural season in the Football League, was hired as the assistant coach and groundsman. Unlike the previous summer, when Nelson had embarked on a pre-season tour of Spain, the team did not play any friendly matches during the build-up to the campaign. The club strip remained unchanged from the previous season; a blue jersey, white shorts and black socks with white and blue trim.|$|E
