25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E
50|$|Fan dampers {{are used}} to control gas flow {{into and out of}} the {{centrifugal}} fan. They may be installed on the inlet side or on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> of the fan, or both. Dampers on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> impose a flow resistance that is used to control gas flow. Dampers on the inlet side (inlet vanes) are designed to control gas flow by changing the amount of gas or air admitted to the fan inlet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> is {{fitted with}} a {{pressure}} gauge. As gas is drawn from the <b>outlet</b> <b>side,</b> the pressure inside the regulator body falls. The diaphragm is pushed back by the spring and the valve opens, letting more gas in from the supply until equilibrium is reached between the outlet pressure and the spring. The outlet pressure therefore depends on the spring force, which can be adjusted {{by means of an}} adjustment handle or knob.|$|E

50|$|The {{expansion}} device or {{refrigerant metering device}} (RMD) restricts {{the flow of the}} liquid refrigerantcausing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorbheat from the water in the evaporator.

50|$|In many areas, {{detention}} {{tanks are}} required to be installed inside a property and are used to temporarily hold rainwater runoff during heavy rains and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer.

An overflow outlet may also be utilized which connects higher on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> of the detention tank. This overflow would prevent the detention tank from completely filling up.

50|$|The {{supercharger}} {{takes in}} the fuel-air mixture, compressing it and pushing it into the airbox. From here it reaches the crank housings. On the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> it cools the thermically high loaded piston. After ignition the pistons move outwards, performing the power stroke. At first, the outlet piston opens its slots in the cylinder. The remaining pressure accelerates the gas column towards the exhaust. Then the other piston opens the inlet slots. The pressurized fresh mixture pushes the remaining waste gas out. While the inlet is still opened, the outlet is closed. The supercharger forces additional gas into the cylinder until the inlet slots are closed by the piston. Then the compression stroke starts and the cycle repeats.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. Ph. D. November 2012. Major:Biomedical Engineering. Advisor: Robert T. Tranquillo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 301 pages, appendices A-C. The ability to engineer microvasculature {{would be of}} great utility for the tissue engineering of highly metabolic tissues such as myocardium. In addition, the alignment of such a network {{is critical to the}} success of using it to deliver oxygen to tissue cells because it provides natural inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sides</b> for perfusion. In this work, the ability of engineered microvessels to align with their fibrin gel matrix has been examined and a bioreactor has been designed to harness this ability and perfuse the engineered tissue. The results indicate that engineered microvasculature can be aligned via cell-induced gel compaction and that this compaction improves lumen density. Interstitial flow provided an additional increase in lumen density. A mathematical model of fluid flow through engineered microvessels and a variety of image analysis methods were also developed...|$|R

50|$|In {{domestic}} applications, traps {{are typically}} U, S, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture. An S-shaped trap {{is also known}} as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. The most common of these traps in houses is referred to as a P-trap. It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> of a U-bend, thereby creating a P-like shape. It is also referred to as a sink trap because it is installed under most house sinks.|$|E
50|$|Twelve {{culverts}} {{were noted}} and they vary in date and design. They include circular concrete pipes, larger rectangular pipes and modern rectangular section pipes. Some are single, some double {{depending on the}} expected water flow. Around each of the inlets is a rock channel and wings to guide the water {{into the mouth of}} the pipe and these have been individually designed for the particular site. Many have concrete end walls and loose concrete added to the surface. On the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> there is mostly a rock surround around the pipe and, if space, a concrete apron to prevent erosion. As with any functional road, there is evidence of a continuous upgrade of surface and culverts as required for safety but many of the original culverts survive.|$|E

The bridges at Hoggards Lane, Cowlane and Willowbank have been replaced by corrugated steel tubes, backfilled up {{to the level of the}} road surface. Mains bridge is still a single arched brick structure, while at the end of the drain, Whinsgate bridge consists of the main brick arch under the A161 road, with arches in both wing walls, which enable tracks to cross Dodds Dyke and Eastoft Drain. The southern track over Eastoft Drain was formerly the course of the Fockerby Branch of the Axholme Joint Railway until its closure in 1965.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sides</b> of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R
40|$|Ducted flow {{devices for}} a range of purposes, such as air-moving fans, are {{routinely}} characterised experimentally to understand their acoustic performance as part of the continuing trend for quiet, high efficiency design. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) method 5136 is widely used in industry and academia to determine the sound radiated into a duct. This involves placing the device at the centre of a long cylindrical duct with anechoic terminations at each end to eliminate reflections. A single off-axis microphone is used on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sides</b> that can theoretically capture the plane-wave mode amplitudes but this does not provide enough information to fully account for higher-order modes. In this study, the 'two-port' source model is formulated to include higher-order modes and applied for the first three modes as a proof of concept. This requires six independent surface pressure measurements on each side or 'port'. The resulting experimental set-up is much shorter than the ISO rig and does not require anechoic terminations. The relative importance of the higher-order modes has been considered and the inaccuracies when using the ISO method to find source sound power has been analysed.

50|$|New York City, Washington DC, Seattle {{and other}} cities with {{combined}} systems have this problem due to a large influx of storm water after every heavy rain. Some cities have dealt with this by adding large storage tanks or ponds to hold the water until it can be treated. Chicago has a system of tunnels, collectively called the Deep Tunnel, underneath the city for storing its stormwater. In many areas detention tanks or roof detention systems are required to be installed for a property and are used to temporarily hold rainwater runoff during heavy rains and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer. This lessens {{the risk of the}} public sewer being overburdened during a heavy rain.

5000|$|Increasing {{the size}} of the poppet valves in the engine, thus {{decreasing}} the restriction {{in the path of the}} fuel-air mixture entering, and the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder. Using multiple valves per cylinder results in the same effect - it is often more difficult to fit several small valves than to have larger single valves due to the valve gear required. However, it is difficult to find space for one large valve in the inlet and a large valve on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side.</b> Sometimes a large exhaust valve and two smaller inlet valves are fitted for improved flow. As the pressure generated during combustion provides more force to exhaust the waste gases than the force available to inlet clean charged gas, a larger inlet valve area is needed to provide easier flow. The two smaller inlet valves' total area is larger than that of the single exhaust valve and thus provides that easier inlet flow. This is why exhaust valves are typically smaller in area than the inlet valves.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E
40|$|The noise {{sources and}} {{mechanisms}} {{of the front}} and rear HV AC systems of an automotive are characterized experimentally. The front system has three main outlet ducts equipped with louvers and operates in two modes of bypass and recirculation. The inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sides</b> of the rear system are both located in the cabin; hence, it always works only on the recirculation mode. The outlet duct of the rear system is covered by a ten-hole curved plate which is found to be a strong source of noise. Both systems are tested at the highest possible flow rate, as it is the most annoying condition of noise generation. The noise coming out of each duct of {{the front and rear}} systems and their fan units are measured separately. Since the fan {{is an important part of}} the systems, it is studied at different speeds with more details. In order to compare the effect of the noise generated by the fan section with the noise produced by the complete system, the impeller is replaced with a speaker generating an overall sound level similar to the fan noise. Under this condition, the flow noise due to the evaporator core, distributive ducts and louvers are cancelled. It is concluded that at low frequencies the duct flow-noise i...|$|R

The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the <b>outlet</b> <b>side.</b> For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing.

This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps.
