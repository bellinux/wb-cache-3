2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with Diane Sawyer, Williams {{admitted that she}} had recently suffered a stroke. [...] "I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I could see, but I couldn't remember anything from the past," [...] she said. In June 2008, Williams attended Cyd Charisse's funeral, which she did while seated in a wheelchair.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{his death}} in 1963, he never gave up in trying to obtain an amnesty for Nazis. Despite his protests against anti-Semitism in the 1930s, in his memoirs, with full {{knowledge}} of the Holocaust as of 1962, the [...] "Brown Bishop" [...] said of his actions in favour of war criminals and genocide perpetrators and participants: [...] "I thank God that He <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> allowed me to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and [...] them escape with false identity papers" [...] — however, the [...] "victims" [...] were Axis prisoners of war and their [...] "concentration camps" [...] were Allied detention camps.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Rabinowitz invited Sarna {{to join a}} {{group of}} select {{students}} he took along with him while being transferred to the Telz Yeshiva. When the yeshiva temporarily closed in 1906, Sarna returned to Maltsch, studying under Rabbi Shimon Shkop. One year later, he returned to Knesses Yisroel Yeshiva in Slabodka, where {{he became one of}} the yeshiva's best students. He drew attention of the Alter, who played a major role in his spiritual growth. Describing their special relationship, Sarna wrote, [...] "Without the Alter, I would have been like a blind and a deaf person. He <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> my ears, and I acquired my entire approach to Torah study from him." ...|$|E

2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
60|$|Comforted not {{a little}} by this assurance, I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked up.|$|E

50|$|Ahead of its European release, {{the film}} was {{programmed}} in Italy's inaugural Riviera International Film Festival, where it competed in the Main Competition for the Grand Jury Prize against films such as Xavier Dolan's It's Only the End of the World, Amanda Kernell's Sami Blood, Leyla Bouzid's As I <b>Open</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Ciro Guerra's Academy Award-nominated film Embrace of the Serpent.|$|R
50|$|He has {{collaborated with}} many European musicians, {{both as a}} co-composer and producer, {{including}} the Italian groups Hollowblue and Marti and the Spanish group Migala.

60|$|I sat up, <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{carried the}} tankard {{to my lips}} with both my hands. And as I drank I looked at Pons.|$|E
60|$|These {{were the}} words that greeted my ears on {{recovering}} my senses. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw that I {{was surrounded by a}} number of boys and men.|$|E
60|$|Presently, I {{heard a noise}} again, {{and woke}} up quietly, without starting, but just <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> peered {{about as well as}} the dim light of the little oil-lamp would allow me.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has said}} that without the {{financial}} help of Ethiopians abroad, {{he would not have}} made it to February's games in Italy. He also admitted that he had no chance of winning medals in either event he has entered in, Alpine and cross-country skiing. [...] "I'm a realist. My goals are for further down the road. I want this Olympics to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> hopefully the <b>eyes</b> of other Ethiopians." ...|$|R
5000|$|For many years, as {{she later}} recalled, she was {{haunted by the}} events of the Revolution. [...] "I used to have the same dream, as if I stood with my back to a pit {{and they were going to}} shoot me...my {{awakening}} was not less terrible than the dream itself, because I was constantly afraid to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> see that they had really come to take me to the execution".|$|R
60|$|With {{his thumb}} {{he turned up}} one of my eyelids, whereat I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> gazed up at the group bending over me.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked around, {{trying to}} make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was {{standing}} over me looking sour and sick, too. He says: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have lain insensible for many minutes, for when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw the surgeon and my second mate bending over me, it was still with the roar of cannon in my ears.|$|E
60|$|Once more my life came back, {{and with}} it a sense of deadly {{sickness}} and of aching pain. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw a kind face bending over me, and knew that I {{was in the room}} of a builded house.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} a {{clattering}} poker awakened me next morning and when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> sleepy <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked out a new world displayed itself before me.|$|R
6000|$|... "What? What?" [...] {{he murmured}} sleepily, without moving or opening his eyes. His head still felt heavy, {{and he had}} not the courage to raise his eyelids. In his ears there still lingered the sound of entreating whisper.--"Am I awake?--Why do I hear the voices?" [...] he argued to himself, hazily.--"I cannot {{get rid of the}} horrible {{nightmare}} yet.--I have been very drunk.--What is that shaking me? I am dreaming yet--I must <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> be done with it. I am only half awake, it is evident." ...|$|R
60|$|I awoke. Oh, {{broad and}} wide awake I was, {{although}} I did not <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>And</b> please {{know that in}} all that follows I knew no surprise whatever. Everything was the natural and the expected. I was I, be sure of that. But I was not Darrell Standing. Darrell Standing had no {{more to do with}} the being I was than did Darrell Standing's parchment-crinkled skin have aught to do with the cool, soft skin that was mine. Nor was I aware of any Darrell Standing--as I could not well be, considering that Darrell Standing was as yet unborn and would not be born for centuries. But you shall see.|$|R
6000|$|Then I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> my arms, too, {{and we were}} reunited. It {{must have}} been a happy moment, so happy that it numbed me beyond appreciation. [...] "Yes, Sally," [...] I agreed; [...] "but no man ever had such a {{wonderful}} girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} some beastly {{creature}}s. Once in the Sudan I was dozing on the sand when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> there was a horrid creature like a big slug with horns, short and thick, about a foot long, moving away in front of me." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. Was he very yellow {{when he came}} in, or had he turned very yellow in the last minute or two? I really can't say, and I can't ask Louis, {{because he was not}} in the room at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{features}} Maxi Jazz singing as an insomniac {{while he}} struggles to sleep ("I toss and I turn without cease, like a curse, <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> rise like yeast/At {{least a couple of}} weeks since I last slept, kept takin' sleepers, but now I keep myself pepped"). The subject is resonant with fans of dance music, as stimulant use is common in club/rave culture, and insomnia is a common side effect. The insomniac is also rather destitute ("Make my way to the refrigerator/One dry potato inside, no lie, not even bread, jam, when the light above my head went bam..."). This song uses the Roland D-50 custom patch [...] "Stable Master" [...] for its main riff.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I-to her!'Said Miriam, {{coarsely}} imitating {{his tone}} of shocked humility. 'I, the poor penniless boy-scholar, to her, the great, rich, wise, worshipped she-philosopher, {{who holds the}} sacred keys of the inner shrine of the east wind--and just because I am a man, and the handsomest man in Alexandria, and she a woman, and the vainest woman in Alexandria; and therefore I am stronger than she, and can twist her round my finger, and bring her to her knees at my feet when I like, as soon I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> discover that I am a man. Eh, boy! Did she ever teach you that among her mathematics and metaphysics, and gods and goddesses?' ...|$|R
50|$|The Fat Tulips {{were formed}} in the late 1980s in Peterborough by Mark D. Their first release was a flexi disc called You <b>Opened</b> Up <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{featured}} Sarah C. on vocals. Sarah quickly left the band, supposedly {{to pursue a career}} designing crop circles in Peru.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} I thought it well to wake up. Turning my head I yawned, <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at her}} vaguely, seeing which her {{expression}} changed in a flash from that of brooding power to one of moved and anxious girlhood; in short, it became most sweetly feminine.|$|E
6000|$|MR. A. So this is {{the society}} into which we have allowed our poor child to run! I blame myself {{exceedingly}} for not having made more inquiries. Grief made me selfishly passive, or I should have <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> theirs to the danger. My poor Mary, what a shock {{it will be to}} her! ...|$|E
6000|$|When I came to myself, I {{was lying}} upon {{the sofa in}} Dr. McCarthy's study, and the Doctor himself was seated beside me. He {{appeared}} to be watching me intently and anxiously, for as I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> looked about me he gave a great cry of relief. [...] "Thank God!" [...] he cried. [...] "Thank God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh! He'll serve {{me right}} enough, never you mind!' says Lavender {{to me with}} a laugh. 'If he don't pay up willingly, I've got that in my pocket which will make him sit up <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> lady's <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> Sir John Etty's too about their {{precious}} noble lord.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went back}} to my horse {{blankets}} and waited an hour for Garthwaite. My headache had not gone away. On the contrary, it was increasing. It was by an effort of will only that I was able to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> look at objects. And with the opening of <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the looking came intolerable torment. Also, a great pulse was beating in my brain. Weak and reeling, I went out through the broken window and down the street, seeking to escape, instinctively and gropingly, from the awful shambles. And thereafter I lived nightmare. My memory of what happened in the succeeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare. Many events are focussed sharply on my brain, but between these indelible pictures I retain are intervals of unconsciousness. What occurred in those intervals I know not, and never shall know.|$|R
60|$|I shut <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> once more, <b>and</b> {{looked hard}} into the past. Slowly, as I looked, {{a sort of}} dream seemed to come over me. I saw it vaguely now, or thought I saw it. Flash, flash, flash, flash. Then {{the sound of the}} pistol. Then the Picture, and the Horror, and the awful blank. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> again, <b>and</b> told the Inspector so.|$|R
