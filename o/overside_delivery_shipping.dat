50|$|A {{major problem}} {{was how to}} deliver the supplies. The first <b>delivery</b> <b>ship</b> had a {{hazardous}} journey, with many delays. Deliveries by road were slowed by the difficult logistics involved in contracting lorries in France. Rail {{was probably the most}} reliable form of supply.All three methods were used; with no consignment ever going astray. The Co-operative Wholesale Society's Export Department lent its assistance to ensure the safe delivery of all consignments.|$|R

It {{is also known as}} the Cantonese Clique because many of its leaders hailed from Guangdong.

25|$|The San Francisco Estuary {{together}} with the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta represents a highly altered ecosystem. The region has been heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water <b>delivery,</b> <b>shipping,</b> agriculture, and most recently, suburban development. These needs have wrought direct changes in the movement of water {{and the nature of}} the landscape, and indirect changes from the introduction of non-native species. New species have altered the architecture of the food web as surely as levees have altered the landscape of islands and channels that form the complex system known as the Delta.|$|R

5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built <b>delivery</b> <b>ship.</b> The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s, {{the average}} {{shipping}} distance for milk was 250 mi by rail. As most milk {{is produced in}} the West Country (where the rain falls), but consumed in London and the East where {{the bulk of the}} population resides, most milk trains were west-east running. Express Dairies had two major depots in London: one in Kensington, which took deliveries from the GWR and SR; and one in Hendon which took <b>deliveries</b> <b>shipped</b> by the LMS from Carlisle, then the longest dedicated milk train route in the United Kingdom. The term [...] "milk run" [...] became synonymous in railway terms and later the English language, as a routine trip where the timetable was set and remained unaltered.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water <b>delivery,</b> <b>shipping,</b> agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{storage in}} the presence of backwardation and the exist-ence of the Working curve for Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybeans, and wheat markets and the Kansas City Board of Trade wheat market using 1990 – 2010 data. Two spread measures—the futures-spot and futures-futures—are matched with deliverable stocks on the first Friday of delivery. To account for grade and location aggregation issues, the futures-spot spreads are measured using the lowest spot bid and highest futures price. Storage {{in the presence}} of backwardation is pervasive both in terms of the percentage of observations and the magnitude of the stockholdings. The Working curve emerges most clearly in KCBT wheat and soybeans. Convenience yield is also supported by the negligible holdings of <b>delivery</b> <b>shipping</b> certificates in backwardations. Overall, the results show that the Working curve does indeed still work today. When evaluating policy proposals to deal with heigh-tened price volatility in agricultural markets it is important that models incorporate this well-established relationship...|$|R
