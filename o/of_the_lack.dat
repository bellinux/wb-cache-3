5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
5|$|Any size {{estimate}} of A. fragillimus must be regarded with caution because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of specimens or even detailed, accurate documentation of its fossils.

5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist.

The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats {{at the hands of}} the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, {{but it is very}} likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} that because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E
5|$|Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who {{landed at}} Acre {{in late summer}} 1217, invited Bohemond to join the Fifth Crusade. Bohemond and his vassals marched to Acre. However, the crusade ended in failure because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a united command. Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{together}} with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh's half-sister, Melisende of Lusignan, in Tripoli. During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli.|$|E

5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of stopover or feeding sites, {{or the lack of}} thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of technology {{to keep it from}} spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} {{has been}} criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysoreâ€”in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavurâ€”left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 {{were the}} first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.

They took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.|$|E

The game was re-released as a part of both the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America.|$|E
