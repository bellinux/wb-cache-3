5|$|After the Restoration of King CharlesII in 1660 his father's {{fortunes}} took a {{turn for}} the better, although he remained far from prosperous. In 1661, Winston became Member of Parliament for Weymouth, and as a mark of royal favour he received rewards for losses incurred fighting against the Parliamentarians during the civil war, including the appointment as a Commissioner for Irish Land Claims in Dublin in 1661. When Winston departed for Ireland the following year, John enrolled at the Dublin Free School; but by 1664, following his father's recall to the position of Junior Clerk Comptroller of the King's Household at Whitehall, John had transferred his studies to St Paul's School in London. The King's own penury meant the old Cavaliers received scant financial reward, but the prodigal monarch could <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> which would cost him nothing – positions at court for their progeny. Thus in 1665, John's sister Arabella became Maid of Honour to Anne Hyde, the Duchess of York. Some months later John, 15, joined her at court serving as page to Anne's husband, James, Duke of York, the King's brother, destined to be king himself. It was also known that John Churchill, a keen student, was educated in the University of Oxford, where he studied philosophy, classics and mathematics. He was well-educated and proficient in French, Latin, Greek and German.|$|E
25|$|En {{route to}} the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who {{for the first time}} speaks to the Titan. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> other than death. At the Kyln Thanos {{encounters}} Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, and the Shi'ar warrior Gladiator, who are both prisoners, and the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn. Thanos departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite freed from the prison. Thanos then meets the Fallen, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control. He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.|$|E

[...] John Evan Seery, author of Political theory for mortals: shades of justice, images of death, commented that the song portrayed Madonna's [...] "discipline of gaze". Brian Hadden from Time found the song depressing. Tiju Francis from Vibe wrote: [...] "For a such a commonly titled song, Madonna’s take does at least <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> a little different. [...] 'The Look of Love' actually sounds like part of the score– Madonna could well be singing over what was previously just the moody character development background synth music apparently present in every film in the ’80s. [...] But its slow-burn feel means the song is four minutes of not-particularly-intense brooding that never peaks– unlike a ballad." ...|$|E
500|$|Picket Fences {{was one of}} {{the first}} American {{television}} series to feature an intimate kiss between two women. Two years earlier, L. A. Law had aired an episode (also written by Kelley) that included a kiss between bisexual-identified character C. J. Lamb (Amanda Donohoe) and straight-identifying Abby Perkins (Michele Greene). The kiss led to complaints to the network and five sponsors pulled their ads from the episode. In reviewing incidents of lesbian kisses on network television programs, the New York Times noted that they tended to happen during [...] "sweeps" [...] periods, when the networks use Nielsen ratings to determine advertising rates. Noting lesbian kisses during sweeps periods on such shows as L. A. Law, Roseanne, Party of Five and Ally McBeal in addition to the Picket Fences episode and noting that they were occurring about once per year, the Times concludes that kisses between women are: [...] "Eminently visual; cheap, provided the actors are willing; controversial, year in and year out; and elegantly reversible (sweeps lesbians typically vanish or go straight when the week's over), kisses between women are perfect sweeps stunts. They <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> for everyone, from advocacy groups looking for role models to indignation-seeking conservatives, from goggle-eyed male viewers to progressive female ones, from tyrants who demand psychological complexity to plot buffs." ...|$|E

500|$|When Madonna {{finally decided}} {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001. Jamie King was signed up as the {{creative}} director and the choreographer of the show. King {{said in an interview that}} the tour [...] "was so hectic that I suffered from depressions and fell considerably ill." [...] Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day, five days a week, with more and more dancers joining for the show. In the end, ten dancers and two backup singers were used. Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument, and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show. French house music expert Stuart Price, who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music, was signed as bassist and keyboards player. Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high-tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance. Madonna clarified: [...] "I don't see the point of doing a show unless you <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> that is going to mind-boggle the senses. It's not enough to get on stage and sing a song. It's all about theatre and drama and surprises and suspenses." ...|$|E
500|$|Katsuya Eguchi, {{who managed}} Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, {{produced}} Wii Sports. With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach {{people who had}} not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way. Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended Wii Sports to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this. Wii Sports {{was designed as a}} simple introductory line meant to <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> for both gamers and non-gamers. Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity. At one point in development, Mario characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players who preferred Miis. The game supports a [...] and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second, and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion. Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible. Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play Wii Sports, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players {{would be more likely to}} play Wii Sports through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.|$|E
500|$|Marvel's {{announcement}} {{was met with}} widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of Muslimah Media Watch, a diversity advocacy group, told Al Jazeera America that [...] "She {{is going to be}} a window into the American Muslim experience" [...] and that she [...] "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim." [...] Brett White of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes." [...] Hussein Rashid writing for CNN said, [...] "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims. She is born in the United States, appears to be part of the post-9/11 generation and is a teenager." [...] Muaaz Khan of The Guardian compared Kamala Khan to Malala Yousafzai and indicated that the rest of entertainment industry should follow Marvel's example. However, Dr. Leon Moosavi of the University of Liverpool felt that the character's family would reinforce the stereotype of restrictive Muslim parents and that her shape-shifting ability resembled several anti-Muslim stereotypes, especially taqiyya: a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are at risk of significant persecution. Political satirist Stephen Colbert joked about Marvel's decision to introduce a Muslim superhero on his television show. Comedian Conan O'Brien also made a joke via Twitter, linking the character's religion to polygamy, but later removed it due to public backlash.|$|E

[...] Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. [...] Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it [...] "really sweet, really funny and really scary, [...] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human." [...] Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a [...] "funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner" [...] and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel [...] "a masterpiece". [...] Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art [...] " [...] little uneven, but... at its best when the lights go out."

500|$|The {{ratings of}} the PC port were {{not as high as}} for the other versions. It was heavily criticized for no mouse support and {{frustrating}} keyboard controls, low-quality FMV cut scenes, choppy graphics rendering (lacks shadows and proper lighting) and requiring a gamepad controller for more precise aiming and gameplay. Despite the issues, the game still received generally positive reviews from IGN and GameSpot that praised the gameplay. Japanese game magazine Famitsu reviewed the Wii version of the game, with two editors giving the game a perfect 10 score, and the remaining pair giving it a 9, resulting in a score of 38 out of 40. The reviewers noted that the game's improved controls <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> fresh and different. Multiple reviewers agreed that even those who own the original will find something fun and enjoyable in this version. British magazine NGamer gave the Wii Edition a score of 96%, slightly lower than the 97% given to the GameCube version. They praised the visuals, controls, and features and commented on the fact that such an [...] "exceptional package" [...] was on sale for a low price; however, when writing about the Wii controls, they said, [...] "if you've played the GC version this won't be as special". Official Nintendo Magazine gave the Wii version 94%, 3% less than the original due to it simply not having the same impact it did back then. IGN praised the Wii version, stating it is the superior edition, but does not push the Wii like it did with GameCube and PS2. GameSpot praised the new controls of the Wii Edition but commented on the lack of exclusive Wii features. Hypers Jonti Davies commended Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition for its [...] "visual improvements" [...] but criticized it for having [...] "no new content".

And there was a cost to standing apart from Apple: Because of its popularity, there were millions of apps and accessories for the iPod. As good as it was, the Zune HD couldn’t match Apple’s sheer market power."

2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm said we could never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can <b>offer</b> <b>something</b> by way of satisfaction".

[...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love.
