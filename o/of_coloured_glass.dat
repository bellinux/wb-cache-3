5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, Michael Farrar-Bell {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} figurative window design, using backgrounds of transparent quarries and maintaining much the same range <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> as had been perfected by Clayton in the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{made headlines}} soon after construction as panes <b>of</b> the <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> shattered {{and fell to}} the street below due to impurities and the heat of Melbourne's summers.|$|R
25|$|Lace patterns: Strips <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> were twisted with a {{contrasting}} coloured {{thread of}} glass before being fused together. This {{was a popular}} method in the early period, but appears to {{have gone out of}} fashion by the mid-1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|These {{windows are}} simple and decorative, {{frequently}} utilising {{the skills of}} the provincial plumber/glazier. Many of these windows are among the earliest use <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> but comparatively few have survived because later Victorians have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s.|$|E
25|$|The solid {{brick wall}} of the rear {{elevation}} is pierced by a high window {{in the form of}} a narrow cross. It has two layers of glazing, consisting of an inner layer <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> segments and an outer layer of clear glass. Glazed doors provide access to the vestries. Adjacent to the western vestry door is a toilet block built up against the rear wall (this structure is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance).|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of ionizing radiation {{on the glass}} is described in this work, then it shows that roentgen or c – radiation causes structural changes in the glass, which manifests by colouring the glass and which can be prevented by suitable stabilisation of the glass structure (addition of CeO 2).

In what follows, given are the transmission features of three groups <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses</b> under the impact of X radiation...|$|R

25|$|Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns: This was {{produced}} by binding rods <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then wound round a glass rod whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern. Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be {{fused together to form}} a plate or fused to plain glass.|$|E
25|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{are created by}} cutting pieces <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> to match a drawn {{template}} and setting them into place in a mesh of lead cames and supporting the whole with rigid metal bars. Details such as facial features can be painted {{on the surface of}} the glass, and stains of bright yellow applied to enliven white areas. The effect is to add an appearance of brilliance and richness to a church interior, while the media lends itself to narratives. If the lead is properly maintained, stained glass is extremely durable and many windows have been in place for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Winston's {{interest}} in the technicalities <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> production led him to take shards of medieval glass to James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance was {{because it was too}} flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended a return to the manufacture of hand-made crown and cylinder glass with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coloured</b> <b>glass</b> {{has been}} {{produced}} since ancient times. Both the Egyptians and the Romans excelled at the manufacture <b>of</b> small <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> objects. Phoenicia {{was important in}} glass manufacture with its chief centres Sidon, Tyre and Antioch. The British Museum holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the Lycurgus Cup, which is a murky mustard colour but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the Portland vase which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.|$|R
50|$|The zellige {{tradition}} of Arabic North Africa uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, {{but as the}} different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use <b>of</b> small <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> fields also make it rather like enamelling, but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.|$|R

The implication of the digital image is that bleached coral may be all there is to see if we continue to remain passive about the denigration of the reef...|$|R
25|$|Glass making {{reached its}} peak at the {{beginning}} of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind. The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology. From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised, and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement. The use <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> as a decorative addition to pale and colourless glasses also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels. After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to Constantinople rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the Roman military in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there. By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.|$|E
500|$|The {{date of the}} {{original}} foundation of a Christian building at this location is unclear, although one 19th-century writer {{said that it is}} supposed that a church was first established here in about 605. No part of a building from that period survives; the walls of the present structure have been said (by the 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones) to be [...] "probably not older than the fifteenth century". Some restoration took place in 1812. The building was again restored, and a new roof added, in the late 19th century. [...] The work was funded by Lord Stanley of Alderley, a convert to Islam and patron of the church, whose donations to rural churches carried the requirement that Islamic detail should be included in any restoration work. [...] At St Peirio's, the windows have geometric patterns of small panes <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> as a result. The same condition was imposed by him for the work carried out in 1867 nearby at St Mary's Church, Bodewryd.|$|E
500|$|The date of {{foundation}} of the first religious building on this site is unknown. [...] A church was recorded here in the Norwich Taxation of 1254, and the church was owned by the Augustinian priory at Penmon, at the south-eastern corner of Anglesey, during the 13th century; the priory also owned (and therefore received the tithes from) the Anglesey churches of Llanddona and St Cwyllog, Llangwyllog at this time. The current building has medieval walls, and {{the doorway of the}} porch {{on the north side of}} the church, which is of 15th-century style, is the oldest dateable part of the building. A 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales put the date for the doorway at c.1500. St Mary's was restored in 1867 by Henry Kennedy, the architect of the Diocese of Bangor, after the previous church was struck by lightning. [...] It was funded by Lord Stanley of Alderley, a convert to Islam, whose donations to rural churches carried the requirement that Islamic detail should be included in any restoration work. [...] At St Mary's, the windows have geometric patterns of small panes <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> as a result. This condition was also imposed by him for the restoration work at the nearby church of St Peirio, Rhosbeirio (now closed), where the new windows were also decorated with geometric patterns in glass.|$|E
50|$|The church {{displays}} {{a letter from}} King Charles I from 1643 which has a painted coat of arms on the reverse. Monuments include a Classical marble wall monument to Benjamnin Sampson who died in 1840, <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> in east chancel window to John Jose <b>of</b> Mellingey and <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> in a south aisle window to geologist William Jory Henwood who died in 1875.|$|R

5000|$|As a rule, {{the glass}} is smooth with the deck fronts, but on each floor, one façade is {{withdrawn}} to create an outdoor space. These outdoor spaces are connected from ground to roof. In front of the glass facades, a series <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> semi-transparent <b>glass</b> louvers can open or close to protect from the sun, while adding dashes of colour to the indoor environment ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} Heaton, Butler and Bayne, Clayton and Bell often robed figures in their windows with dark-coloured cloaks that are dotted with gold stars or flowers. In general practice, a cloak was {{arranged}} {{in such a}} way that it could be cut from fairly large pieces of glass, so that the main folds fell along lead lines and the lesser folds could be applied with paint. But the characteristic [...] "gold-star" [...] decoration of Clayton and Bell necessitated that the entire cloak be divided into little pieces <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> with the gold stars set at the intersections. This created a network of lead which was not necessarily visually desirable. But in practice, the yellow stars catch the eye of the viewer to the extent that the lead disappears. It is another very effective technique for creating a rich and lively appearance, without resorting to heavy over-painting.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they entered}} the chamber, led by the Prince. It was a fine place, with a vaulted stone roof and windows <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> that looked like the chancel of a church. Only {{at the head of}} it, where the altar should have been, was a kind of dais. On this dais were set some high-backed oaken chairs with many {{lanterns}} behind them in which burned tapers that, together with a great wood fire, gave light to the chamber.|$|E
60|$|I make no {{apology for}} this digression, {{especially}} {{as this is}} an introduction which all young people and those who never like to think (and it is a bad habit) will naturally skip. It seems to me very desirable that we should sometimes {{try to understand the}} limitations of our nature, so that we may not be carried away by the pride of knowledge. Man's cleverness is almost indefinite, and stretches like an elastic band, but human nature is like an iron ring. You can go round and round it, you can polish it highly, you can even flatten it a little on one side, whereby you will make it bulge out the other, but you will never, while the world endures and man is man, increase its total circumference. It is the one fixed unchangeable thing -- fixed as the stars, more enduring than the mountains, as unalterable as the way of the Eternal. Human nature is God's kaleidoscope, and the little bits <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> which represent our passions, hopes, fears, joys, aspirations towards good and evil and what not, are turned in His mighty hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars, and continually fall into new patterns and combinations. But the composing elements remain the same, nor will there be one more bit <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> nor one less for ever and ever.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{the rooftop}} of Modernist {{architect}} Le Corbusier's Cité Radieuse building in Marseilles hosted an installation <b>of</b> mirrors and <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> by Buren. Défini, Fini, Infini (2014) was an installation for the Marseilles Modulor (MaMo), led by French designer Ora-Ïto, who in 2013 transformed the iconic rooftop {{into an international}} arts space.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of St Joseph's Cathedral houses many finely crafted items, including {{a black and}} white Italian marble [...] "checkerboard" [...] tiled floor and a number <b>of</b> stained and <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> panels depicting scenes from the New Testament.

50|$|Lyall's Jewllery Shop is a small, single story shop {{constructed}} of rendered brick.

60|$|Then one day I {{made up my}} mind, and so {{ended the}} trouble. In {{the window of a}} small plumber's shop in a back street near, stood on view among brass taps, rolls of lead piping and cistern requisites, various squares <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> the sort of thing chiefly used, I believe, for {{lavatory}} doors and staircase windows. Some had stars in the centre, and others, more elaborate, were enriched with designs, severe but inoffensive. I purchased a dozen of these, the plumber, an affable man who appeared glad to see me, throwing in two extra out of sheer generosity.|$|E

In a vague way, with some very early memories to help me, I can imagine it--the shock of pleased wonder at the sight of that immense interior, that far-extending nave with pillars that stand like the tall trunks of pines and beeches, and at the end the light screen which allows the eye to travel on through the rich choir, to see, with fresh wonder and delight, high up and far off, that glory <b>of</b> <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> as of a window half-open to an unimaginable place beyond--a heavenly cathedral to which all this is but a dim porch or passage! ...|$|E
50|$|The chancel is boarded {{to about}} 2100mm with timber panelling, {{featuring}} carvings of pointed arches with foiled heads. This panelling steps {{higher on the}} rear, northern, wall.

These examples are not painted. However {{it was not until the}} advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries.

60|$|Colour {{may also}} be {{introduced}} as a means <b>of</b> distinction. <b>Coloured</b> <b>glass</b> may be set in the alternate spaces; but {{it is necessary to}} remark that these coloured sectors will be inferior in power to those which remain white. This objection is, however, obviated to a large extent (especially where the dioptric spherical mirror is used) by such an arrangement as is shown in Fig. 4; where the two sectors, WW, are left unassisted, while the two with the red screens are reinforced respectively by the two sectors of mirror, MM.|$|R
