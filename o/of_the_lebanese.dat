25|$|Kamal Jumblatt's {{opposition}} to the Syrian military intervention of June 1976 in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official <b>Lebanese</b> Government and his adversaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian <b>Lebanese</b> Front militias, resulted in the PSP/PLA fighting Syrian Army troops at <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Bhamdoun in <b>the</b> Chouf District. Between 13 and 17 October 1976, the Druze PLA and its allies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunni Al-Mourabitoun militia, <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> Arab Army (LAA) and the PLO inflicted heavy losses on the Syrian 3rd Armoured Division {{when they tried to}} enter Bhamdoun by force.|$|R
5|$|From 1923 to 1958, {{conflicts}} erupted among Armenian {{political parties}} struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. The ARF and Hunchakian parties struggled in 1926 {{for control of}} the newly established shanty-town of Bourj Hammoud in Lebanon; ARF member Vahan Vartabedian was assassinated. The assassination of Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi followed in 1929 and 1931 respectively. In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. As a result, in the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> civil strife of 1958, an armed conflict erupted between supporters (the ARF) and opponents (Hunchakians, Ramgavars) of Zareh.|$|E

The {{following}} day, the 24th Division's 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry deployed to Turkey and flew to Beirut on 19 July. They were joined by a medium tank battalion (seemingly 3rd Battalion, 35th Armor Regiment) and support units, which assisted the Marines in forming a security cordon around the city. The force stayed until late October, providing security, making shows of force, including parachute jumps, and training the Lebanese Army. When factions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> government worked out a political settlement, they left. The 24th Division's 1/187th lost one soldier killed by a sniper.|$|E

The use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card and PIN in claiming goods and monies sent from abroad {{has been designed to}} prevent unauthorized persons from claiming what is due to the Lebanese Identity Card holder.|$|E
5|$|The DLM won {{its first}} {{parliamentary}} seat in Lebanon's 2005 elections representing the Tripoli district. On 2 June 2005, amid election rounds, Samir Kassir, {{a founder of}} the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> Communist Party and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> Civil War in 1975.

5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, {{the party}} was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and {{generally}} ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to {{play an active role}} in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian Lebanese MP, Maarouf Saad, {{was shot}} and killed, {{reportedly}} by the Lebanese Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces, precipitated the Lebanese Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias with the backing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lebanese</b> and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.|$|E
