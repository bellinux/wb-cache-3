5|$|After the English Reformation Northern England {{became a}} centre <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> and Irish {{immigration}} increased its numbers further, especially in North West cities like Liverpool and Manchester. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area underwent a religious revival that ultimately produced Primitive Methodism, {{and at its}} peak, in the 19th century, Methodism was the dominant faith in much of Northern England.|$|E
5|$|In Royal Prussia, 41% of the parishes {{were counted}} as Lutheran {{in the second}} half of the 16th century, but that {{percentage}} kept increasing. According to Kasper Cichocki, who wrote in the early 17th century, only remnants <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> were left there in his time. Lutheranism was strongly dominant in Royal Prussia throughout the 17th century, with the exception of Warmia (Ermland).|$|E
5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, which represented approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 Tongan census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put {{them back in the}} line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|In 1658, Parchevich was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Marcianopolis (named after an Ancient Roman city near modern Devnya, northeastern Bulgaria). Along with the Diocese of Nicopoli headed by Filip Stanislavov, Marcianopolis {{was one of the}} two sees which succeeded the Bulgarian Custody as the governing body <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in Bulgaria. Parchevich also held the position of Bulgarian internuncio to the Viennese court. In 1661, Parchevich had to step down as Archbishop of Marcianopolis due to pressure from Rome, which condemned his clerical inactivity, though in 1668 he became apostolic vicar to Moldavia despite continuing suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Pendle {{was part}} of the parish of Whalley, an area {{covering}} , too large to be effective in preaching and teaching the doctrines of the Church of England: both the survival <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and the upsurge of witchcraft in Lancashire have been attributed to its over-stretched parochial structure. Until its dissolution, the spiritual needs of the people of Pendle and surrounding districts had been served by nearby Whalley Abbey, but its closure in 1537 left a moral vacuum.|$|E

5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E
5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|Distrust of Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious pluralism, the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave the Counter Reformation {{a foothold in the}} lower Rhine. Ernst was a product of Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, he invited Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education and pastoral visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E
5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> The interview was published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Much of Colbert's {{personal}} life {{was reflected in}} his character on The Colbert Report. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often referenced his interest in and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism,</b> science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married. The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, was often downplayed or even denied outright, and he frequently referred to having attended Dartmouth College (which was {{at the forefront of}} the conservative campus movement in the 1980s) rather than his actual alma mater, Northwestern. In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of The Colbert Report until the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E

5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would {{be relegated to}} a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it {{on the basis of}} patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism.</b> When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Montreal Area is {{predominantly}} Roman Catholic; however, weekly attendance in Quebec {{is among the}} lowest in Canada. Historically Montreal has been a centre <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> in North America with its numerous seminaries and churches, including the Notre-Dame Basilica, the Cathédrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. Some 65.8% {{of the total population}} is Christian, largely Roman Catholic (52.8%), primarily because of descendants of original French settlers, and others of Italian and Irish origins. Protestants which include Anglican Church in Canada, United Church of Canada, Lutheran, owing to British and German immigration, and other denominations number 5.90%, with a further 3.7% consisting mostly of Orthodox Christians, fuelled by a large Greek population. There is also a number of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox parishes. Islam is the largest non-Christian religious group, with 154,540 members, the second-largest concentration of Muslims in Canada at 9.6%. The Jewish community in Montreal has a population of 90,780. In cities such as Côte Saint-Luc and Hampstead, Jewish people constitute the majority, or a substantial part of the population. As recently as 1971 the Jewish community in Greater Montreal was as high as 109,480. Political and economic uncertainties led many to leave Montreal and the province of Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant James I, {{who became}} King of England in 1603, was less {{tolerant}} <b>of</b> <b>Catholicism</b> than his followers had hoped. Catesby therefore planned {{to kill him}} by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament, the prelude to a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy Fawkes. Described latterly as a charismatic and influential man, {{as well as a}} religious zealot, over the following months he helped to bring a further eight conspirators into the plot, whose naissance was planned for 5November 1605. A letter sent anonymously to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, alerted the authorities, and {{on the eve of the}} planned explosion, during a search of Parliament, Fawkes was found guarding the barrels of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.|$|E
