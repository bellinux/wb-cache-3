5000|$|<b>On-bill</b> <b>financing</b> permits {{consumers}} to repay energy upgrade loans through utility bills. Similar to PACE financing, on-bill repayment affords lenders security in a developing market. Because electricity is a necessity, utility bills {{have a very}} high rate of repayment nationwide. Placing loan payments on a utility bill increases their chances of being repaid, appealing to private investors and facilitating affordable loans for consumers. [...] Also, the on-bill structure enables renters to reap the benefits of added energy efficiency. Furthermore, the simplicity of <b>on-bill</b> <b>financing</b> is attractive—it is logical that tenants pay for the good they consume.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to its federal policy work, EESI launched a community-focused energy efficiency program in 2014, following several years of work on a pilot program in South Carolina (starting in 2010). The <b>On-Bill</b> <b>Financing</b> Project is an ongoing initiative aimed at helping families reduce energy use, cut energy bills, and improve home comfort through an innovative financing approach known as <b>on-bill</b> <b>financing.</b> Participating organizations provide their customers with loans for home energy upgrades, such as better insulation or more energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. These loans are then repaid through a monthly charge on the customer's utility bill. When the program is properly designed, the savings resulting from the energy efficiency upgrades outweigh {{the cost of the}} loan, and the customer saves money every month.|$|E
40|$|Stormwater {{management}} can be {{a significant}} challenge in urban areas. As population density grows and impervious surface cover increases, the amount and intensity of stormwater runoff escalates correspondingly, placing added stress on water management systems and natural ecosystems. Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is increasingly being seen as a critical tool for addressing these challenges (Garrison and Hobbs 2011). Although a number of {{cities across the country}} have turned to GSI as a key component of their stormwater management system, oftentimes the scope is limited to public property. Since GSI is a distributed approach to stormwater management, programs must engage private property owners (Francis 2010). Energy efficiency programs have seen significant success engaging private property owners across the built environment despite experiencing many of the same challenges attracting investment in the face of high up-front costs and limited inherent collateral value (Palmer, Walls and Gerarden 2012). This project aims to better explain the key factors that influence the success of three types of energy efficiency financing programs in the United States and draw cross-sector parallels to GSI in order to inform a decision-making framework for GSI program design. This is accomplished through 1) a review of the existing literature on energy efficiency program design and the potential equivalencies between energy efficiency and green stormwater infrastructure, 2) an exploration of three financing mechanism case studies, and 3) the definition of decision criteria to provide initial direction for the evaluation of appropriate financing mechanisms in a specific case. In order to better understand the settings in which specific energy efficiency financing mechanisms would be most appropriate, this research evaluated three <b>financing</b> mechanisms: <b>on-bill</b> repayment, PACE <b>financing,</b> and performance contracting with Energy Services Companies (ESCOs). The data informing these case studies was gathered through research of secondary sources, a series of interviews of energy efficiency program administrators and energy and/or GSI industry experts, and a review of example programs. The case analysis informed a consideration of how each financing mechanism could be applied in the stormwater context. The findings reach beyond the existing literature to examine national level themes and provide a local-level decision making framework. Based on the findings of this report, a number of key factors exist that can direct decision-making around green stormwater infrastructure financing. First, a fundamental consideration is whether a stormwater fee structure exists to create the opportunity for savings. Assuming this requirement is met, the following criteria indicate the suitability of the three financing mechanisms for a specific jurisdiction: building stock of greatest concern, authorizing legislation, political buy-in, incentives, and regulatory requirements. The importance of each criteria varies for each financing mechanism. PACE programs are most appropriate in states with a history of PACE authorizing legislation, strong regulatory drivers for action and a wider range of target property sizes. Performance contracting is more appropriate in places with a high concentration of large-scale commercial building stock, limited legislative support and multiple available incentives. On-bill repayment programs are most applicable where there are more opportunities to pursue small-scale GSI and strong regulatory drivers for action. In addition, shared key factors that apply to all three of the case financing mechanisms will impact program viability and are important to consider in program design. These include the stormwater fee size and available margin, the potential to offer credit enhancements, the ability to leverage an economy of scale, the policy requirements affecting loan term stringency, and existing availability of financial partners. An applied analysis of how these findings impact Seattle, WA further illustrates the implications of these findings. The City has an itemized stormwater fee structure, an existing stormwater consent order and is actively investing in GSI. PACE financing is not possible in the state due to legislative restrictions. However, a stormwater credit already exists in the city and a commercial GSI program would target medium to large-scale commercial customers. Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Seattle explore performance contracting by supporting the development of a GISC. In order to make this possible, the City could create a public private partnership with local innovators and consider opportunities to provide credit enhancements. Secondarily, the City might also consider the potential to offer on-bill repayment for small scale projects. In both cases, the City will need to conduct further inquiry into the financial implications and political feasibility of these endeavors and create a framework for measurement and verification of stormwater savings...|$|R

40|$|PECI’s EnergySmart Grocer (ESG) {{program has}} {{implemented}} a comprehensive energy efficiency (EE) program targeting mid-to-large size {{grocery stores and}} supermarkets for Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) customers. Since 2012, {{the introduction of the}} utility’s <b>On-Bill</b> <b>Financing</b> (OBF) option to the ESG program has allowed ESG to more effectively engage hard-to-reach customers with small margins to commit to more expensive projects with a longer payback period. Together, ESG and PG&E have successfully leveraged this financing option to increase the comprehensiveness of energy efficiency projects, resulting in deeper savings on a larger scale. This paper will focus on how ESG integrated OBF into a target market approach for grocery stores in order to increase the size and scope of individual projects, thereby overcoming financial barriers to drive more complex measure adoption. ESG has built a program on a high-touch market engagement model that targets the entire community of market partners (e. g. contractors, manufactures, distributors and industry associations) and utilizes available resources, such as financing, to deliver high volume and comprehensive energy savings that support market transformation...|$|E

40|$|Energy, {{whether from}} electricity, natural gas, heating oil, propane, kerosene, or wood, is {{essential}} for the well-being of many Americans, yet those who spend more than 10 percent of their income of energy services can be considered “fuel poor. ” This study assesses the extent and severity of fuel poverty in Vermont. It analyzes energy burdens in Vermont by household income deciles, using data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Approximately 71, 000 people suffered from fuel poverty in Vermont in 2000, and in 2012 the number rose to 125, 000, or one in five Vermonters. Startlingly, fuel poverty grew 76 percent during this period. Excess winter deaths, caused potentially by fuel poverty, kill more Vermonters each year than car crashes. The article then provides 12 policy recommendations based on a small sample of elite semi-structured research interviews. These include suggestions that the Vermont legislature better fund investments in weatherization among low-income households; that community groups and social service agencies scale up the training of energy efficiency coaches; that state agencies endorse improvements in housing efficiency and appropriate fuel switching; and that utilities and fuel providers offer extra assistance for disconnected households and allow for <b>on-bill</b> <b>financing</b> of efficiency improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{stifling}} {{summer heat}} that raged {{across the nation}} was difficult for everyone, but one group had a more difficult time than others—those who {{could not afford to}} cool their homes. Disparities like these will likely only get worse. Poor communities of color that are already vulnerable and disproportionately impacted by pollution will shoulder a larger burden of climate change impacts. These neighborhoods, often called environmental justice communities, have fewer resources to adapt to the effects of climate change. More measures should be taken to increase the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in environmental justice communities before the gap becomes worse. New policies are needed to increase renewable energy development and energy efficiency in environmental justice communities. Current measures are insufficient to help these communities when energy prices and temperatures rise, as they are expected to. The right policies could reduce pollution in areas that are already overburdened and would provide these vulnerable communities with new economic opportunities. To develop new policies, innovative renewable energy structures including <b>on-bill</b> <b>financing</b> and a feed-in tariff should be explored. In addition, policymakers should examine the environmental tools used in settlements, mitigation measures, and pollution fees as potential areas for innovation. Finally, policymakers need to consider: how to assure benefits help the targeted community, gentrification issues, whether a separate entity can administer the program, and the potential legal implications...|$|E
