5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in their views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> of birth control. The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning, {{although}} {{large numbers of}} Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control. Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

25|$|Reports by investigative {{journalists have}} linked FIFA {{leadership}} with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging {{related to the}} election of FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. {{are expected to be}} extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017 reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethics</b> committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.
