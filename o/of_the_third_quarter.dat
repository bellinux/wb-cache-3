5|$|Despite {{starting}} {{almost at}} midfield, the offensive drive that {{began at the}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter</b> failed to reach field goal range, and the Hokies were forced to punt.

5|$|During {{the second}} half, however, {{things began to}} fall apart for Virginia Tech. Hokie quarterback Sean Glennon threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once, giving Georgia {{excellent}} field position and many chances to score. Tech clung to a 21–13 lead at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter,</b> but halfway through the fourth quarter, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech.

Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play was typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter,</b> which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
