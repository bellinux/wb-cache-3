5|$|A notable {{find in the}} Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at {{the time}} thought {{to be from the}} 5th century, and {{considered}} to be among the earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England. A copy of the amulet was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as its silver content dated to the 19th century <b>or</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom <b>or</b> <b>later</b> periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
