5|$|While waiting, {{he hears}} an {{explosion}} nearby, {{and leaves the}} room to investigate. He finds two men trapped by fallen components in a fire-engulfed room. Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, and tries to coax the <b>other</b> <b>man</b> to leave the burning room, but the man refuses. Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside and drags the <b>other</b> <b>man</b> to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the psychological test. Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year. Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time.|$|E

The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the <b>other</b> <b>man</b> were members.|$|E

It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the <b>other</b> <b>man</b> of publishing results based on those of the author.|$|E

While a service with 80 members {{attending}} was taking place, the men threw rocks etched with Nazi swastikas through the synagogue's stained glass windows, then sped off. The men were caught, pleaded guilty, and were convicted. They served sentences ranging from a 6-month work release term and five years probation, to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the ringleader, Jacob Laskey.|$|E

Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again.

5|$|At 19:00, {{two local}} men spotted Sabina whilst walking a dog on Christchurch Street, Fenton. One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The <b>other</b> <b>man</b> was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how {{she was trying to}} locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any <b>other</b> <b>man</b> to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each <b>other</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
5|$|President's Park, {{better known}} as Lafayette Square, may have its own {{spectral}} resident. Philip Barton Key II {{was the son of}} Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the <b>other</b> <b>man</b> pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near the spot where he was shot.|$|E

Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage.

5|$|Union {{military}} leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing {{him with a}} group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman saw him and told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson's group with 150 men and engaged them in battle. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson and one <b>other</b> <b>man,</b> the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.|$|E
