25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses,</b> and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|E
25|$|The {{achromatic}} lens, which {{greatly reduced}} color aberrations in <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, {{first appeared in}} a 1733 telescope made by Chester Moore Hall, who did not publicize it. John Dollond learned of Hall's invention and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and <b>objective</b> <b>lenses,</b> but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or <b>objective</b> <b>lenses,</b> although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E
40|$|A {{constant}} magnification {{optical tracking}} system for continuously tracking of a moving object is described. In the tracking system, a traveling <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> maintains a fixed {{relationship with an}} object to be optically tracked. The <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> was chosen to provide a collimated light beam oriented {{in the direction of}} travel of the moving object. A reflective surface is attached to the traveling <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> for reflecting an image of the moving object. The object to be tracked is a free-falling object which is located at {{the focal point of the}} <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> for at least a portion of its free-fall path. A motor and control means is provided for mantaining the traveling <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> in a fixed relationship relative to the free-falling object, thereby keeping the free-falling object at the focal point and centered on the axis of the traveling <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> throughout its entire free-fall path...|$|R

25|$|The {{refractive}} index (1.7) and optical dispersion properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an optical material for wide-angle lenses, in optical microscope <b>objective</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{and for the}} core of fiber-optic lines. See Optical fiber for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO2 are transparent to the infrared spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for night-vision technology in the military, luxury vehicles, and Thermographic cameras. GeO2 is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.|$|E
2500|$|In optical instruments, {{dispersion}} {{leads to}} chromatic aberration; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect. [...] This was {{especially true in}} refracting telescopes, before the invention of achromatic <b>objective</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Telescopes {{built in}} the 17th and early 18th century used single element non-achromatic <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> that {{suffered}} from interfering rainbow halos (chromatic aberration) introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of single glass lenses. This degraded {{the quality of the}} images they produced. Telescope makers from that era found that very long focal length objectives had no appreciable chromatic aberration (the uncorrected chromatic aberration fell within the large diffraction pattern at focus). They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the objective's focal length 4 times as long (focal length had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have focal lengths as long as 150 feet. Besides having very long tubes, these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. [...] Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's support frame and tube flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic sights are {{classified}} {{in terms of}} the optical magnification and the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> diameter, e.g. 10×50. This would denote 10 times magnification with a 50 mm <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> In general terms, larger <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> diameters, due to their ability to gather larger amounts of light, provide a larger exit pupil and hence provide a brighter image at the eyepiece. On fixed magnification sights the magnification power and objective diameter should be chosen {{on the basis of the}} intended use.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> {{compatible with the}} reading and writing of a blue-ray disc (BD) and a China blue high-definition disc (CBHD). The <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> comprises an incident surface and an emergent surface, wherein the incident surface is a free curved surface; and the emergent surface is a flat aspheric surface. Parallel laser beams sequentially pass through the incident surface and the emergent surface, and form diffraction limit-level focal spots on a BD information layer and a CBHD information layer. The invention also relates to an optical pickup head and a compact disc reading-writing device, which are compatible with the reading and writing of the BD and the CBHD. According to the <b>objective</b> <b>lens,</b> the optical pickup head and the compact disc reading-writing device compatible with the reading and writing of the BD and the CBHD, a free curved surface technology is adopted, and the working distance of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> is prolonged, so that requirements for the assembly accuracy of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> are lowered, the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> is high in yield and low in cost, and the numerical aperture of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> {{is not required to}} be manually regulated. 本发明涉及一种兼容BD和CBHD读写的物镜，其中包括为自由曲面的入光面和为平坦非球面的出光面，平行激光光束依次经过所述入光面和所述出光面分别在BD信息层处和CBHD信息层处形成衍射极限级聚焦光斑。本发明还涉及一种兼容BD和CBHD读写的光学头以及光盘读写装置。本发明的兼容BD和CBHD读写的物镜、光学头以及光盘读写装置采用自由曲面技术，增长物镜的工作距离，以降低对物镜装配精度的要求，成品率高，成本低，不需要人为调整物镜的数值孔径。Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 李荣彬Inventor name used in this publication: 杜雪Inventor name used in this publication: 李莉华Inventor name used in this publication: 王文奎Title in Traditional Chinese: 兼容 BD 和 CBHD 讀寫的物鏡、光學頭以及光盤讀寫裝置Chin...|$|R

50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. <b>Objective</b> <b>lenses</b> with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image.

50|$|In single {{particle}} imaging applications, {{the number}} of photons detected from the fluorescent label {{plays a crucial role}} in the quantitative analysis of the acquired data. Currently, particle tracking experiments are typically carried out on either an inverted or an upright microscope, in which a single <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> illuminates the sample and also collects the fluorescence signal from it. Note that although fluorescence emission from the sample occurs in all directions (i.e., above and below the sample), the use of a single <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> in these microscope configurations results in collecting light from only one side of the sample.
