5|$|Pope John Paul II {{provided}} a moral focus for anti-communism; {{a visit to}} his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement that galvanized <b>opposition</b> <b>and</b> {{may have led to}} his attempted assassination two years later.|$|E

5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the <b>opposition</b> <b>and</b> the media.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s {{plans were}} laid {{for a massive}} freeway system in Washington. Harland Bartholomew, who chaired the National Capital Planning Commission, thought that a rail transit system would never be {{self-sufficient}} because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline. But the plan met fierce <b>opposition,</b> <b>and</b> was altered to include a Capital Beltway system plus rail line radials. The Beltway received full funding; funding for the ambitious Inner Loop Freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the Metro system.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the golden dust metaphor in Bolesław Leśmian’s poems, fairy-tale prose, essays and plays. It is {{interpreted}} as one of many variations of the black sun trope, the gnostic and alchemical symbol for the unity of <b>oppositions</b> <b>and</b> for transformation. Analysis of Leśmian’s metaphor leads to the conclusion that his writing corresponds to gnosticism and alchemy. It takes up the concept of material concreteness, nudging the reader to combine <b>oppositions</b> <b>and</b> transmutation. Acting through words, through tropes, reflects the performative status of Leśmian’s creative work...|$|R

5|$|In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; {{their union}} was {{controversial}} {{because he was}} a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal.
