50|$|The {{combination}} of the interlocking wood grain {{at the apex of}} the branch and the <b>occluded</b> <b>knot</b> embedded into the tree's trunk make mature branch attachments in trees very strong components of a tree's crown. From static testing, branch attachments {{have been found to be}} far stronger than attachments made at forks in trees.|$|E
50|$|As {{the typical}} lateral {{branch of a}} tree and its trunk expand in {{diameter}} at different rates, {{the base of the}} smaller branch becomes occluded in the larger trunk of the tree which is producing a larger increment of growth, and this occluded part of the branch forms a knot that provides substantial additional mechanical support to the attachment as it develops (Fig. 2). This is not the case in tree forks, where the growth rate of both branches is approximately equal, and no <b>occluded</b> <b>knot</b> is formed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Failure {{to inject}} a drug through the {{epidural}} catheter because of epidural catheter connector malfunction {{is a rare}} complication. In this report, we describe a case of epidural catheter â€“ connector malfunction in a 45 years old male undergoing emergency explorative laparotomy for haemoperitoneum under general anaesthesia and insertion of epidural catheter for post operative analgesia. After insertion of catheter after completion of surgery, drug could not be injected in the catheter. After common causes like kinking, <b>knotting,</b> <b>occluded</b> catheter were ruled out, the cause {{was found to be}} in the epidural catheter connector assembly which is not encountered frequently. This case warrants that anaesthesiologists must also be aware of rare causes and the preventive steps to avoid such complications...|$|R
