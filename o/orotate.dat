5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base <b>orotate,</b> which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E
5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of <b>orotate</b> decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E
25|$|Lithium salts {{affect the}} central nervous system in a variety of ways. While the citrate, carbonate, and <b>orotate</b> salts are {{currently}} used to treat bipolar disorder, other lithium salts including the chloride were used in the past. For a short time in the 1940s lithium chloride was manufactured as a salt substitute, but this was prohibited after the toxic effects of the compound were recognized.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orotate</b> phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) or {{orotic acid}} phosphoribosyltransferase is an enzyme {{involved}} in pyrimidine biosynthesis. It catalyzes {{the formation of}} orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) from <b>orotate</b> and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. [...] In yeast and bacteria, <b>orotate</b> phosphoribosyltransferase is an independent enzyme with a unique gene coding for the protein, whereas in mammals and other multicellular organisms, the catalytic function is carried out by a domain of the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Nieper {{reported}} that lithium <b>orotate</b> contained 3.83 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg and lithium carbonate contained 18.8 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg Nieper {{went on to}} claim that lithium did not dissolve from the <b>orotate</b> carrier until it passed through the blood-brain barrier; however, a 1976 study documented that lithium concentrations within the brains of rats were not statistically different between equivalent dosages of lithium from lithium <b>orotate,</b> lithium carbonate, or lithium chloride. While {{this study was conducted}} with rats, it directly contradicts the aforementioned assumptions made by Nieper and others. The pharmacokinetics of lithium <b>orotate</b> in human brains is poorly documented and further inquiry is needed to affirm that lithium concentrations in the brain are higher with lithium <b>orotate.</b> Major medical research has not been conducted on lithium <b>orotate</b> since the 1980s due to its patent status and the abundant availability of lithium carbonate. As previously stated, lithium intake appears to be effective even at low doses, and this may account for lithium orotates claimed effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|Orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP), {{also known}} as orotidylic acid, is a {{pyrimidine}} nucleotide which is the last intermediate in the biosynthesis of uridine monophosphate.

50|$|While lithium <b>orotate</b> {{is capable}} of {{providing}} lithium to the body, like lithium carbonate and other lithium salts, there are no systematic reviews supporting the efficacy of lithium <b>orotate</b> {{and it is not}} approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any medical condition.|$|E

50|$|Synthesis of {{pyrimidine}} nucleotides is a {{much simpler}} process. The formation of the pyrimidine ring begins with the conversion of Aspartate to N-Carbamoylaspartate by undergoing a condensation reaction with carbamoyl phosphate. Dihydroorotase and dihydroorotase dehydrogenase then converts N-Carbamoylaspartate to <b>orotate.</b> <b>Orotate</b> is covalently linked with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) by <b>orotate</b> phosphoribysol-transferase yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). OMP follows with the decarboxylation by orotidylate decarboxylase to from the Uridylate (UMP) ribonucleotide structure. UMP can then be converted to Uridine-5’-trisphosphate (UTP) by two kinases reaction.

Transition state analyses have used isotopic effects and quantum calculations {{to reveal a}} completely dissociated dianionic <b>orotate</b> structure, a ribocation, and a nucleophilic pyrophosphate molecule. Nonetheless, this is unexpected, since most N-ribosyltransferases involve protonated and neutral leaving groups, whereas deprotonated <b>orotate</b> {{is not a good}} one in the cationic transition state.|$|E
5000|$|Lithium <b>orotate,</b> is a salt of {{orotic acid}} and lithium. It is {{available}} as the monohydrate, LiC5H3N2O4·H2O.

It is marketed as a dietary supplement, though only barely researched between 1973-1986 to treat certain medical conditions, such as alcoholism, and Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|In yeast and bacteria, OMP decarboxylase is {{a single}}-function enzyme. However, in mammals, OMP decarboxylase {{is part of}} a single protein with two {{catalytic}} activities. This bifunctional enzyme is named UMP synthase and it also catalyzes the preceding reaction in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, the transfer of ribose 5-phosphate from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to <b>orotate</b> to form OMP.

5000|$|This bifunctional enzyme has {{two main}} domains, an <b>orotate</b> phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase, [...] ) subunit and an orotidine-5’-phosphate decarboxylase (ODCase, [...] ) subunit. These two sites {{catalyze}} {{the last two}} steps of the de novo uridine monophosphate (UMP) biosynthetic pathway. After addition of ribose-P to <b>orotate</b> by OPRTase to form orotidine-5’-monophosphate (OMP), OMP is decarboxylated to form uridine monophosphate by ODCase. In microorganisms, these two domains are separate proteins, but, in multicellular eukaryotes, the two catalytic sites are expressed on a single protein, uridine monophosphate synthetase.|$|E

50|$|It {{is often}} given in {{combination}} with drugs that alter its bioavailability and toxicity such as gimeracil, oteracil or uracil. These agents achieve this by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (uracil/gimeracil) or <b>orotate</b> phosphoribosyltransferase (oteracil).|$|E
50|$|Oteracil mainly {{stays in}} the gut because of its low permeability, where it reduces the {{production}} of 5-FU by blocking the enzyme <b>orotate</b> phosphoribosyltransferase. Lower 5-FU levels in the gut result in a lower gastrointestinal toxicity.|$|E
