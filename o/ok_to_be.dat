[...] "It's <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mad after a breakup or after something goes wrong with a relationship", Swift said. The subject of [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] remains unaware that he is the inspiration behind the song. The song was chosen as a single based on the reactions it garnered at concerts. Swift recalled that, although [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] (2006) was her only single at the time she began opening for Rascal Flatts' Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07), [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it [...] "at the top of their lungs".|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too young for a role." ...|$|E

Hader toured the studio over a week, and also [...] "helped out" [...] in the story room. He was invited to play Fear {{by the end of}} his stay there, but was also asked to contact fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) veteran Amy Poehler, whom the team viewed as perfect for the character of Joy. [...] "They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" [...] he recalled. He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film. When the story was pitched to Kaling, she broke down in tears, explaining [...] "I just think it's really beautiful that you guys are making a story that tells kids that it's difficult to grow up and it's <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sad about it." ...|$|E

Hollywoodlife.com reported that Gaga spent the first week of February editing the video at the Greenwich Hotel, New York, working during the night as she had to spend the morning rehearsing for her upcoming Grammy Awards performance. Media reports suggested that the singer might play the character of Jo Calderone, the male model she had portrayed in the September issue of Japanese Vogue Hommes.

500|$|Giveamanakick {{formed in}} 2001 {{following}} {{the demise of}} Tooth. Left with several songs, Ryan performed as a solo artist with an electric guitar. One night, he encountered Keith Lawler, who played guitar in another band at the time, and Lawler began drumming with Ryan. In 2002, the duo released a split single with Mr. Creosote titled [...] "Darko Filopovic", a song which would later feature as the final track on their debut album. By 2003, they had supported several more established acts, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Rocket from the Crypt. In 2003, {{there were reports that}} the duo's debut album, titled Is it <b>ok</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loud, Jesus?, would be released on a label called Larry Gogan Records but this later emerged to be a joke published by a fledgling Foggy Notions. The duo's debut album was in fact published on 3 July 2003 with that same title by the independent label Out On A Limb Records as the label's first release, with Giveamanakick having finished recording it in January that year. It received two out of five stars in a review by RTÉ's Tom Grealis who wrote, [...] "this is what happens when rawness comes without any real sense of purpose". The Hot Press reviewer said listening to the album was [...] "something akin to being battered round the head with a plank of wood for half an hour" [...] but, nonetheless, [...] "bloody fantastic".|$|E

500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest and talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E

To prepare {{to write the}} script, Etheredge-Ouzts viewed as many horror films from the 1980s as he could locate. From these, he identified a film structure and stock character types ("the final girl", [...] "the ingénue", [...] "the slut", [...] "the tough guy"), turning each type into a gay version of the heterosexual trope. Rather than write characters who are LGBT stereotypes or whose sexuality is their critical, defining personality trait, Etheredge-Ouzts wrote characters whose sexuality appeared incidental to them.

A set of six stamps was issued by Royal Mail in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Twits, The Witches, Matilda, Fantastic Mr Fox, and James and the Giant Peach. Dahl's influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance film director Tim Burton recalled from childhood [...] "the second layer [...] of connecting to a writer who gets {{the idea of the}} modern fable – and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get. I've always like that, and it's shaped everything I've felt that I've done." [...] Steven Spielberg read The BFG to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it's <b>OK</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different as well as to have an active imagination: [...] "It's very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing."
