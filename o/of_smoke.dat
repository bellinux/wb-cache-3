5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types <b>of</b> <b>smoke,</b> such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E

It has been found that for large-space buildings with a height greater than 6 m and a building area more than 1500 m 2, factors like building height and building area can slightly affect the curve trend <b>of</b> fire <b>smoke,</b> while such factor like fire power has more significant influence on the curve trend <b>of</b> fire <b>smoke.</b> Through the analysis of temperature rise curves <b>of</b> fire <b>smoke</b> in various fire scenarios, the paper proposed a whole-process prediction model for the temperature fields <b>of</b> fire <b>smoke</b> <b>of</b> localized fires in large-space buildings.
