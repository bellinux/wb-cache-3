5|$|In mid-August, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. The northern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> {{led to the}} formation of Tropical Storm Emily in the Atlantic, while the southern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> continued westward. It crossed Central America on August31 and September1, characterized by a large area of convection and a mid-level circulation. The disturbance traversed southern Mexico before emerging offshore, where it began to interact with a broad area of low pressure that existed in the eastern Pacific for several days prior. Shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated about a well-defined center, leading to the formation of {{a tropical}} depression near Manzanillo, Mexico by 12:00UTC on September5. A portion of the tropical wave also combined with monsoonal-like flow across the Bay of Campeche to form Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, a small {{burst of}} {{moisture}} in the system was noted in the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave,</b> but no other notable development occurred. On July 2, the wave moved over Central America and produced scattered areas of strong convection {{off the coast of}} Honduras. Later in the day, the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT satellite pass. By the afternoon, the wave developed into an area of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended from the Caribbean Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Young's {{interference}} experiment {{played a}} major role in the general acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains.

5|$|On October 7, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa near Cape Verde, and despite semi-favorable conditions, the wave did not develop initially, due to embedded westerlies, which caused the wave to remain disorganized, despite having deep convection.

5|$|The {{genesis of}} Tropical Storm Don {{was from a}} {{tropical}} wave first identified off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July16. It tracked westward over the open Atlantic for several days, with minimal convection confined to the monsoon trough. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the potential for gradual tropical cyclogenesis on July21, when it was positioned about 750mi (1200km) to the east of the Windward Islands. As the system moved through the Lesser Antilles on July23, it produced tropical-storm-force winds in Puerto Rico. The combination of vertical wind shear and the wave's proximity to land impeded further development. Convection increased along the northern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> on July24, although by the following day the NHC expected no significant redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Jeanne {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 7. Containing a scattered area of moderate convection, the wave tracked westward at 12–17mph (19–28km/h), located to the south of a large ridge. The system initially showed no signs of development, with unfavorably dry air persisting across the region. On September 11, convection became slightly better organized, and the next day broad cyclonic turning became evident. However, overall development was hindered by upper-level wind shear from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean Sea, as well as from an upper-level low to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Norman {{were from the}} same {{tropical}} wave that spawned Atlantic Hurricane Gordon, which emerged {{off the coast of}} Africa on September4.

When the wave reached the eastern Pacific Ocean on September16, it interacted with a pre-existing low-level circulation, which produced a large area of disturbed weather. On September18, the convection began contracting and organizing, gradually developing a circular area of thunderstorms with well-defined outflow. It is estimated that at 0000UTC on September20, the system developed into Tropical Depression Sixteen-E, about 205miles (335km) south-southeast of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
