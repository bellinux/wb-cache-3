I don't believe Mr. Maxwell can make the play different from what it is, structurally, and I don't believe <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Salome can be subdued or subordinated. Then why not play Salome as strongly as possible, and trust to her strength to enhance Haxard's effect, instead of weakening it?" ...|$|R
