Fourth, to foster economic development for the highland.|$|E
5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is an aspect <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> important for food security. The loss <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> {{is considered one}} of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have a high rate <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment of protected areas {{around the world and}} the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Loss <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> stems {{largely from}} the habitat loss and {{fragmentation}} produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|Modern botany is a broad, {{multidisciplinary}} {{subject with}} inputs from most {{other areas of}} science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, plant propagation, breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, and the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems are strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone.|$|E

A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.|$|E
40|$|The {{pertinent}} {{roles of}} mangroves have been clearly recognised particularly after the 2004 tsunami. Lots of interests {{have been created}} {{on the importance of}} sustainable management <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity,</b> which plays an important role to the environment {{as well as in the}} socio-economic growth in coastal zones. As the world’s fifth largest, Malaysian mangroves are facing threats from anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, aquaculture, pollution run off and land development. A signatory to both the Convention of Biological Diversity and UNCLOS, Malaysia has to develop national strategies, plans and programmes by taking legislative, administrative and policy (LAP) measures for the conservation and sustainable use <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity</b> outlined by these two conventions. Sustainable management <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity</b> requires proper and effective LAP framework including clear allotment of jurisdictional boundaries between the various departments involved. The existing LAP framework in the management <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity</b> was examined where three problems were found to hinder the sustainable management <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity</b> in Malaysia namely the unclear policies, segmented laws and overlapping administrative jurisdictions. These problems collectively contribute to the insufficiency of the existing LAP framework to provide for the sustainable management <b>of</b> mangrove <b>biodiversity</b> in Malaysia...|$|R

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

The lowest density of snake species in the watershed is along the central part of Nescopeck Creek. The highest density of bird species in the watershed is in the southern and central part of the watershed.

5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity.</b> This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution <b>of</b> <b>biodiversity</b> and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
