5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the Newman Center includes three sculptures created by Denver artists Madeleine Weiner and Kathy Caricof. The two M Allan and Margot Gilbert Frank Bas Relief Carvings on the north facade of the Newman Center were designed to act as [...] "bookends" [...] on the north wall of Trevorrow Hall, home of the Lamont School of Music. The artists wished to depict and celebrate music, specifically jazz (trumpet, bass, drum and saxophone) and classical (opera, horn and violin). The figures and instruments are carved in an energetic style, {{a constant reminder of}} the music being created behind the walls. Each relief is 24 feet tall by 12 inches deep, and is carved from Indiana Limestone. The sculpture on the west patio of the Newman Center, against the exterior wall of the Department of Theatre's Byron Theatre, was also designed and carved by Denver artists Madeline Wiener and Kathy Caricof. This sculpture depicts three characters from the Commedia Dell’Arte, Italian quasi-improvisational theater popular during the Renaissance. Colombina (Columbine), who hides behind Arlecchino (Harlequin), is demure and gentle, while Arlecchino gestures to the throne on which passers-by can sit to join the audience. The smaller figure represents Pantalone, a miserly, scheming masked character in tattered clothing. He clutches a purse, out <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>coins</b> are falling. Note also the hat on the ground that is filled with coins, as if the players are collecting money for a performance. This sculpture is 12 feet tall and is carved from Indiana Limestone. Don’t miss the cute bunnies under the feet of the characters on the left, each of which even has on its own theatrical mask.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was soon}} {{back on his}} feet, and opened {{the first of his}} Institutes of Physical Culture, where he taught methods of exercise, dietary habits and weight training. His ideas on {{physical}} fitness were novel at the time and had a tremendous impact. The Sandow Institute was an early gymnasium that was open to the public for exercise. In 1898 he also founded a monthly periodical, originally titled Physical Culture and subsequently renamed Sandow's Magazine of Physical Culture that was dedicated to all aspects of physical culture. This was accompanied by a series of books published between 1897 and 1904 - the last <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>coined</b> the term 'bodybuilding' in the title (as [...] "body-building").|$|R

It mixed elements of house with the [...] "squelchy" [...] sounds and deep basslines produced by the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. As singles began to reach the UK the sound was re-created, beginning in small warehouse parties held in London in 1986-87. During 1988 in the Second Summer of Love it hit the mainstream as thousands of clubgoers travelled to mass raves. The genre then began to penetrate the British pop charts with hits for M/A/R/R/S, S'Express, and Technotronic by the early 1990s, before giving way to the popularity of trance music.|$|R

40|$|Given a {{long string}} of {{characters}} from a constant size (w. l. o. g. binary) alphabet we present an algorithm to determine whether its characters have been generated by a single i. i. d. random source. More specifically, consider all possible k-coin models for generating a binary string S, where each bit of S is generated via an independent toss of one of the k coins in the model. The choice <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>coin</b> to toss is decided by a random walk on the set of coins where the probability of a coin change is much lower than the probability of using the same coin repeatedly. We present a statistical test procedure which, for any given S, determines whether the a posteriori probability for k = 1 is higher than for any other k > 1. Our algorithm runs in time O(` log `), where ` is the length of S, through a dynamic programming approach which exploits the convexity of the a posteriori probability for k. The problem w...|$|R
