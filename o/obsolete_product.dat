50|$|Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was {{released}} on 27 August 2001, {{a few months before}} Windows XP. This version included DHTML enhancements, content restricted inline frames, and partial support of CSS level 1, DOM level 1, and SMIL 2.0. The MSXML engine was also updated to version 3.0. Other new features included {{a new version of the}} Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK), Media bar, Windows Messenger integration, fault collection, automatic image resizing, P3P, and a new look-and-feel that was in line with the Luna visual style of Windows XP, when used in Windows XP. Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 offered several security enhancements and coincided with the Windows XP SP1 patch release. In 2002, the Gopher protocol was disabled, and support for it was dropped in Internet Explorer 7. Internet Explorer 6.0 SV1 came out on 6 August 2004 for Windows XP SP2 and offered various security enhancements and new colour buttons on the user interface. Internet Explorer 6 updated the original 'blue e' logo to a lighter blue and more 3D look. Microsoft now considers IE6 to be an <b>obsolete</b> <b>product</b> and recommends that users upgrade to Internet Explorer 8. Some corporate IT users have not upgraded despite this, in part because some still use Windows 2000, which will not run Internet Explorer 7 or above. Microsoft has launched a website, http://ie6countdown.com/, with the goal of getting Internet Explorer 6 usage to drop below 1 percent worldwide. Its usage is 6% globally as of October 2012, and now about 6.3% since June 2013, and depending on the country, the usage differs heavily: while the usage in Norway is 0.1%, it is 21.3% in the People's Republic of China. On 3 January 2012, Microsoft announced that usage of IE6 in the United States had dropped below 1%.|$|E

40|$|At {{a recent}} {{congress}} of the European Accounting Association, the President of the Belgian Institute of Registered Auditors, Paul Behets, delivered a plenary speech with the title: Are Financial Statements an <b>Obsolete</b> <b>Product?</b> Behets' answer was "no," that financial statements are {{an essential component of}} the financial reporting system that is necessary for the proper functioning of capital markets. In this article, we reach a similar conclusion, but for somewhat different reasons. A central argument of this article is that an effective system of corporate governance requires an effective financial reporting system, and that an effective financial reporting system requires a well-ordered system of financial accounting. Behets speech provides evidence that financial reporting, and the role of traditional audited financial statements within financial reporting, are undergoing a period of change. The future of financial reporting is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty, but {{it is likely to be}} a future marked by change. One possible path for change has been suggested by Elliott (1994), who has indicated that the currently accepted model of financial reporting might be replaced by electronic information systems providing financial and other forms of information about companies, not necessarily in the form of audited financial statements, which would be widely available via the Internet. Under this scenario, decision-makers could decide on the types information that are important, and then arrange the information in the ways they see fit. Financial reports in their present form (i. e. audited financial statements) might become obsolete as users decided individually on the types of information that are important to them. If this scenario were to come into being, the question arises at to whether there would be a continuing need for financial reports as presently constituted. It is the argument of this article that even if it is technologically feasible for financial reports to be changed from their present form, there would still be a need for financial reports as an important component of corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic metal cycles today confront three {{interconnected}} large challenges: {{an increasing}} global demand due to rising population and escalating industrialization and urbanization, a profound {{change of the}} global supply chain induced by globalization process, and growing pressures on climate change mitigation in a carbon constraint world. For example, the global demand for aluminum, the currently second most used metal worldwide, is anticipated to triple by 2050, by which time global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are advised to be cut by 50 %- 85 % to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Process efficiency improvement and recycling can contribute to reducing emissions per material output; however, long-term material demand and scrap availability for recycling depend fundamentally on the dynamics of societies’ stocks of products in use. Meanwhile, on a country level, growing trade of aluminum products leads to cross-boundary leakages of both GHG emissions and secondary materials. This thesis aims to address these interconnected sustainability challenges using a systems approach that characterizes material flows both along their technological life cycle and across national boundaries, that enables an integrated analysis of the materialenergy- emissions nexus, and that considers both system feedbacks and time lags. We are essentially rolling out the anthropogenic aluminum cycles to understand their dynamics from a temporal perspective, to explore the trade links and interdependencies of individual country cycles from a geographical perspective, and to investigate the environmental consequences and mitigation strategies from a GHG emissions perspective. We endeavor to support industry and government in strategic decisionmaking related to aluminum production, trade, and climate change mitigation. Simulation {{results show that the}} contemporary global aluminum stock in use (0. 6 Gt or 90 kg/capita) has reached about 10 % of that in known bauxite reserves and represents an embodied energy amount that is equivalent to three quarters of the present global annual electricity consumption. The largest proportions of in-use stock are located in the U. S. (28 %), China (15 %), Japan (7 %), and Germany (6 %) and in sectors of building and construction (40 %) and transportation (27 %). Industrialized countries have shown similar patterns of aluminum in-use stock growth: once the per-capita stocks have grown to a threshold level of 50 kg, they kept a near linear annual growth of 5 - 10 kg/capita; no clear signs of saturation can be observed yet. The present aluminum stocks in use vary widely across countries: approximately 100 - 600 kg/capita in industrialized countries and below 100 kg/capita in developing countries. The growing global aluminum in-use stock has significant implications on future aluminum demand and provides important recycling opportunities that will be critical for GHG emissions mitigation in the aluminum industry in the coming decades. The trade-linked multilevel contemporary global aluminum cycle reveals several important features of the aluminum production, trade, and use patterns. (i) While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we thus also find the largest potential for recycling; (ii) The varying magnitudes of aluminum stocks and flows at the country level strongly reflect the availability of resources, the state of development, the structure of industry and economy, and the wealth and lifestyle of the country; (iii) The global aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms, but trade patterns vary significantly by commodity and country; (iv) The major industrialized countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages from aluminum production on, while developing countries rarely create value added in later stages after bauxite refining; (v) A small group of countries {{play a key role in}} the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network. These results provide potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource and supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation. Strategies to decarbonize the anthropogenic aluminum cycle can be divided into process technology improvements (e. g., best available technology, new technologies such as inert anode and wetted cathode) and system-wide improvements (e. g., electricity decarbonization, improvement of post-consumer scrap recycling and processing and manufacturing yield). Taking the U. S. aluminum cycle for example, the reduction potentials that may be theoretically achieved for all process technology improvements add up to a 61 % reduction relative to the baseline in 2006, the majority of which lies within the smelting process. Low emission energy, which implies that all electricity and fuels for the aluminum cycle can be produced with near-zero emissions, shows the highest theoretical reduction potential (83 %) of all system-wide strategies. If we can recover the aluminum lost in landfills, scrap export, and <b>obsolete</b> <b>product</b> stock accumulation and export, significant reductions (in territorial emissions) can be achieved (81 %, 47 %, and 15 %, respectively). Maximizing yield of semi-manufacturing and manufacturing processes (i. e., yield loss completely eliminated) can each reduce emissions by about 10 %. However, combination of these strategies does not lead to additive reductions due to system interactions; challenges are likely to arise while approaching these theoretical potentials in practice. The global model results show that future aluminum in-use stock patterns set essential boundary conditions for future emission pathways and mitigation priorities. Higher stock saturation levels result in higher aluminum demand and higher emissions, and earlier saturation times lead to earlier emission peaks and higher cumulative emissions until 2050. If developing countries follow industrialized countries in their aluminum stock patterns, a 50 % emission reduction by 2050 below 2000 levels cannot be reached even under very optimistic recycling and technology assumptions. The target can only be reached if future global per-capita aluminum stocks saturate at a level much lower than that in current major industrialized countries (200 kg/capita). As long as global inuse stocks are growing rapidly, radical new technologies in primary production (e. g., inert anode and carbon capture and storage) have the greatest impact in emission reduction; however, their ‘window of opportunity’ is closing once the stocks begin to saturate and the largest reduction potential shifts to post-consumer scrap recycling.

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) air {{concentrations}} remain surprisingly high in parts of Africa and Asia.

We conclude that the potential for detrimental effects on the environment and human health due to long-range transport by air, water, or wastes should be of equal concern when managing and regulating industrial organic contaminants.

In particular, it is accepted that clinical evidence evaluating the relative merits of a clinical technique follow its introduction. As such, the licensing of these techniques does not hinge on the existence of this supporting clinical data. Historically, the potential pitfalls associated with this approach were exemplified by the re-introduction of self-ligating brackets. This was accompanied by positive and indeed compelling marketing, which was given credence by {{the findings}} from early non-randomized studies [15, 16]. However, these observations were contradicted by more robust randomized studies, which consistently failed to corroborate either the manufacturers’ claims or {{the findings from}} earlier research [17, 18]. This situation is typical of differences in research design [19] and was aggravated by the subsequent refinement of bracket sub-types, including introduction of updated versions, meaning that by the time potentially influential research was published, <b>obsolete</b> <b>products</b> were being reported on. As such, clinical research should be encouraged at an earlier stage during orthodontic product development to mitigate against this time lag and to provide a meaningful and contemporary clinical underpinning.|$|R
