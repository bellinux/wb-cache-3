By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP <b>operations</b> <b>have</b> had considerable environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E

Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E

Some mining and quarrying <b>operations</b> <b>have</b> been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E

5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture <b>operations</b> <b>have</b> also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
