5|$|After {{crossing}} the Neches River, RE 255 enters Jasper County and proceeds easterly. After a short distance, it crosses <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> relief creek for the Neches River and continues through heavily forested rural areas before turning slightly southeast. The route proceeds <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> creek before slowly bending northeastward. The roadway turns northerly and passes the small community of Beans. While traveling through Beans, the road passes several small farms and houses. It also intersects several county roads, including the former RE 255 Spur, {{which is now}} CR 32. The highway then enters Angelina National Forest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs Main Street, U.S.A. Station, it crosses an access {{road in the}} Adventureland section, travels <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> bridge, enters a small tunnel, then crosses a second access road in the Frontierland section. After going through a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, the train stops at Frontierland Station.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales most {{commonly}} live {{alone or with}} one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations {{where there is a}} high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.|$|E

Station. This completes what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E
5|$|After this junction, NY12E crosses Guffin Creek on its {{way into}} the village of Chaumont. Here, NY12E becomes Main Street again as it {{transitions}} from a rural highway back to a residential street. In the southern part of Chaumont, the route connects to CR125, at which point NY12E begins to pass by a mix of commercial and residential properties. It crosses <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> creek leading away from Chaumont Bay before turning slightly westward and entering the Chaumont Historic District.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> part of the gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E
5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. A small area of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt to take <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> area of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|RE 255 enters Newton County {{traveling}} eastward. The highway proceeds eastward before bending northeasterly {{and entering}} dense forest. Continuing eastward, the road reaches an intersection with SH 87. The route continues east, passing the Mitchell Cemetery. The highway intersects {{a couple of}} county routes and turns east before crossing <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> cove on the Toledo Bend Reservoir. RE 255 the enters the community of South Toledo Bend. It travels parallel to the reservoir, passing several small neighborhoods before shifting eastward. RE 255 passes the Shady Oaks Marina and the Sam Forse Collins Recreational Area before reaching its eastern terminus at an at-grade intersection with FM 692.|$|E

5|$|RE2 {{begins at}} the Rough Canyon boat-launch ramp on the Amistad Reservoir in the Rough Canyon Colonia region of the Amistad National Recreation Area. From this terminus, the highway {{proceeds}} as a two-lane, paved road, which travels through a small parking lot and turns northeastward. The road continues northeast as it passes the Rough Canyon Marina and the Rough Canyon Colonia camping area on {{the eastern edge of}} the park, as well as several houses and independent camp sites. The highway intersects Cam Real Road, which leads to the Devils Shores community and the surrounding area. The route bends eastward, passing the Rough Canyon Inn and a small parking lot and intersecting a small road before it continues into rural areas again. Proceeding along a small ridge, the highway bends northeastward and travels <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> unnamed wash before reaching its eastern terminus with US277/US377.|$|E
5|$|Route59 {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} with Union County Route610 (CR610; South Avenue) {{in the community}} of Cranford. Route59 heads northwestward, passing a couple of businesses in both directions. The route crosses under the New Jersey Transit-owned Raritan Valley Line at which point the border of Cranford and Garwood runs along the center of the road. The route continues to the northwest, passing businesses before ending at a signalized T-intersection with Route28 (North Avenue). The pavement ends at the intersection though a state-constructed bridge carrying the intersection <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> creek is angled such that a road could continue northwest. Throughout {{the entire length of the}} route, it is four lanes wide (two in each direction). There is no signed speed limit on any portion of the route.|$|E
5|$|The Syrian Army, which {{consisted}} of 4,500 soldiers, had been mostly repelled in their offensive {{during the first few}} days of the war, gaining control <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> area along the Syrian border. As a result of the army's poor showing, Quwatli pressed defense minister Ahmad al-Sharabati to resign his post, which Sharabati did on 24 May. He then replaced chief of staff Abdullah Atfeh with Husni al-Zaim during that same period of the war. Following the war, Quwatli accused Zaim of military incompetence and his officers of profiteering. In turn, Zaim accused Quwatli of mismanagement during the conflict. The Syrian public did not spare Quwatli blame for the army's poor performance, causing his popularity, built on his nationalist reputation, to erode further. The Syrian press was also sharply critical of Quwatli and Prime Minister Mardam Bey, urging them to leave their positions. Mardam Bey resigned on 22 August 1948 and was replaced by Khalid al-Azm.|$|E

5|$|The storm made {{landfall}} {{in northern}} Mexico, {{just south of}} the Texas border, shortly after the warnings were extended. Around the time the storm made landfall, a pressure of 1002 mbar (hPa) was recorded in Brownsville, Texas. The storm dissipated later that day over southwestern Texas. No known damage was caused {{as a result of this}} storm and storm-force winds were only recorded <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> area on the Texas coastline. The storm produced minor rainfall over south Texas with Brownsville recording 0.56 in (14.2 mm) and Corpus Christi recording 0.95 in (24.1 in). Winds up to 43 mph (69 km/h) were reported in Brownsville around 1 am CST (0800 UTC) on September 7.|$|E
5|$|Thorfinn the Mighty was {{a son of}} Sigurd and a {{grandson}} of King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II of Scotland). Along with Sigurd's other sons he ruled Orkney {{during the first half}} of the 11th century and extended his authority <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> maritime empire stretching from Dublin to Shetland. Thorfinn died around 1065 and his sons Paul and Erlend succeeded him, fighting at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. Paul and Erlend quarreled as adults and this dispute carried on to the next generation. The martyrdom of Magnus Erlendsson, who was killed in April 1116 by his cousin Haakon Paulsson, resulted in the building of St. Magnus Cathedral, still today a dominating feature of Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} and amplitude of Haumea's light curve were argued to place strong constraints on its composition. If Haumea were in hydrostatic equilibrium {{and had a}} low density like Pluto, with a thick mantle of ice <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rocky core, its rapid rotation would have elongated it {{to a greater extent}} than the fluctuations in its brightness allow. Such considerations constrained its density to a range of 2.6–3.3 g/cm3. By comparison, the Moon, which is rocky, has a density of 3.3 g/cm3, whereas Pluto, which is typical of icy objects in the Kuiper belt, has a density of 1.86 g/cm3. Haumea's possible high density covered the values for silicate minerals such as olivine and pyroxene, which make up many of the rocky objects in the Solar System. This also suggested that the bulk of Haumea was rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice. A thick ice mantle more typical of Kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during the impact that formed the Haumean collisional family.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of the Panaro (or Modena or Castelfranco) was {{a victory}} for King Joachim Murat's Neapolitan forces <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> Austrian force under Frederick Bianchi on 3 April 1815 early in the Neapolitan War. This defeat on the banks on the Panaro River, just south of Modena forced the Austrians to retreat behind the Po River.|$|R
5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E
