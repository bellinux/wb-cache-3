5|$|Like the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament (1999), the game includes almost every character from past Tekken games, {{giving it the}} largest playable roster in a Tekken game to date. Players can choose either a team of two characters <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a solo character. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been positively received by critics, earning averaged review scores {{in the range of}} 82-83% at both GameRankings and Metacritic for the PlayStation 3, Wii U and Xbox 360 versions, as well as several fighting-game-of-the-year awards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament of the PBB {{consisted of}} five powered turrets, equipped with Browning [...]50 M2 machine guns. They were {{installed in the}} nose, in the tail, on the upper fuselage just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, and in two waist positions at the rear fuselage. Except for the waist guns, the turrets had two guns each. Offensive armament could consist of up to 20,000lb of bombs in internal bomb bays in the wing center section (five bays <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> of two Mk.13 or Mk.15 torpedoes slung under the wing center section.|$|E
50|$|The colour may be {{metallic}} (self-coloured or variegated in {{a pleasing}} pattern and similar <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side),</b> orange <b>or</b> calico. Also {{may be in}} full black colour. Metallic colours should appear as burnished metal, extending into the fins. Calico fish should have a blue background with patches of violet, red, orange, yellow and brown, spotted with black.|$|R

2500|$|Tennis {{is played}} on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77m) long, and [...] wide for singles matches and [...] for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is {{required}} in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can {{be no more than}} [...] The net is [...] high at the posts and [...] high in the center. The net posts are [...] outside the doubles court <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or,</b> for a singles net, [...] outside the singles court on each side.|$|E
5000|$|Stenoglossan or rachiglossan radula: each row has {{one central}} tooth and one lateral tooth <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> (<b>or</b> no lateral teeth in some cases) (most Neogastropoda).|$|E
5000|$|... 1 km2 {{means one}} square {{kilometre}} or {{the area of}} a square that measures 1000 m <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 106 m2 (as opposed to 1000 square meters, which is the area of a square that measures 31.6 m on each side).|$|E
25|$|Club cricket, by far {{and away}} the widest form of cricket played worldwide, is largely amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams {{organised}} into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or time may be placed <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> individually, <b>or</b> they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as declaration cricket.|$|R
50|$|Footwraps are {{typically}} square, rectangular or less often triangular. They measure about 40 cm <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> if square <b>or</b> about 75 cm <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> if triangular. Thinner cloth may be folded {{to produce a}} square, rectangular or triangular shape after folding. Russian army footwraps were made of flannel for use in winter and of cotton for use in summer.|$|R
50|$|In shogi, Double Wing Attack {{or simply}} Wing Attack or Centre Game (相掛かり aigakari) is a Double Static Rook (相居飛車) opening {{in which both}} sides play Static Rook (居飛車) by {{directly}} advancing their rook pawns (歩) forward toward their opponent's bishop (角) with the first several moves <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> being identical <b>or</b> very similar.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 km3 {{means one}} cubic {{kilometre}} or {{the volume of}} a cube that measures 1000 m <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 109 m3 (as opposed to 1000 cubic meters, which is the volume of a cube that measures 10 m on each side).|$|E
50|$|To further {{balance the}} forces {{and spread out}} strain, a single large {{flywheel}} can be balanced by two half-size flywheels <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions. However this increases housing and bearing complexity.|$|E
5000|$|Brunoise is {{a culinary}} knife cut {{in which the}} food item is first julienned and then turned a quarter turn and diced again, {{producing}} cubes of about 3 mm or less <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/8-inch dice. In France, a [...] "brunoise" [...] cut is smaller, 1 to 2 mm <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/16-inch dice. Some typical vegetables for a brunoise are carrots, celery, leeks, and turnips. The diced vegetables are blanched briefly in salty boiling water and then submerged in salted ice water {{for a few seconds}} to set the color. The brunoise is used as a garnish in many dishes; it is often used to garnish consommé. A brunoise should be consistent in size and shape, as this helps to create a pleasing and professional presentation.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{commemorative}} plaques {{similar to}} those used in Europe are called historical markers. These vary in colour and design by state. The National Trust for Historic Preservation or the U.S. government, through the National Register of Historic Places, can bestow historical status, with a small bronze marker affixed to the building. Other markers are erected by state historical commissions and similar authorities, local governments or civic groups. These can also be affixed to the building, but are frequently free-standing markers with the text <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> -- <b>or,</b> in larger instances, beginning on one side and continuing to the other.|$|R
50|$|Brownish or golden above; a pale band, edged above {{with a black}} one, along <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of {{the body}} and tail, commencing from the {{supraciliary}} edge; another pale, black-edged band along the upper lip and side of the body; the space between the two light bands <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> usually black, <b>or</b> spotted with black; lower surfaces yellowish-white, tail and hind limbs often reddish.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{field has}} at least one marker at each corner, on the centre line at each side, and 10 metres from each back line on each side. The goals consist of a marker <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> some {{mechanism}} at least half a metre deep to catch the ball [...]|$|E
50|$|With the canting keel {{handling}} the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering {{can be managed}} separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> fore and aft), such as daggerboards. This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast.|$|E
5000|$|The average global hectare would {{occupy the}} area of a {{standard}} hectare. A hectare ( [...] ; symbol ha) is a unit of area equal to 10000 m2 (a square 100 metres <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or,</b> a square 328.08 feet on each side), 2.471 acre, 0.00386102 square miles, or one square hectometre (100 metres squared).|$|E
5000|$|A simple rising vote (in {{which the}} number of members voting <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> stand, <b>or</b> [...] "rise") is used principally in {{cases in which the}} chair {{believes}} a voice vote has been taken with an inconclusive result, or upon a motion to divide the assembly. A rising vote is also the normal method of voting on motions requiring a two-thirds vote for adoption. It can also be used as the first method of voting when only a majority vote is required if the chair believes in advance that a voice vote will be inconclusive. The chair can also order the rising vote to be counted.|$|R
50|$|Double Wing Attack (相掛かり aigakari) is a Double Static Rook opening {{where both}} sides play Static Rook {{with the first}} several moves <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> being {{identical}} <b>or</b> very similar. Both sides advance their bishop pawns to the e rank. Then, golds are moved to defend each bishop's head. Afterwards, pawns on both rook files exchange. Then, the joseki branches off into several different josekis and strategies.|$|R
50|$|Cream flowers form on panicles from February to August. Flowers with a dough like scent. Panicles {{grow from}} the forks of leaves {{or at the}} end of branchlets. The fruit is a brown woody capsule, with blunt prickles. 4 to 8 cm long. Opening up in 5 valves. Each valve has a woody middle divide, and <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> are two <b>or</b> three seeds. The wind blown seeds mature from November to February.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} fast-swimming fish have a {{horizontal}} caudal keel just {{forward of the}} tail fin. Much like the keel of a ship, this is a lateral ridge on the caudal peduncle, usually composed of scutes (see below), that provides stability and support to the caudal fin. There may be a single paired keel, one <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> two pairs above and below.|$|E
50|$|According to {{traditional}} design principles, a boat utilizing a leeboard either {{needs to have}} two retractable leeboards, one <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> a method of removing the leeboard and attaching it to either side while under way, because nearly all sailboats tack {{to work their way}} upwind (with the exception of the proa). However, some small sailboat designers claim to have created seaworthy vessels with only a single, fixed leeboard.|$|E
50|$|The thermal bump {{uses the}} {{thermoelectric}} effect, {{which is the}} direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. Simply put, a thermoelectric device creates a voltage {{when there is a}} different temperature <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. This effect can be used to generate electricity, to measure temperature, to cool objects, or to heat them.|$|E
50|$|In osteichthyes, {{the gills}} contain 4 gill arches <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the head, two <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> for chondrichthyes <b>or</b> 7 gill baskets <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the fish's head in Lampreys.In fish, the long bony {{cover for the}} gill (the operculum) {{can be used for}} pushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum. Without an operculum, other methods, such as ram ventilation, are required. Some species of sharks use this system. When they swim, water flows into the mouth and across the gills. Because these sharks rely on this technique, they must keep {{swimming}} in order to respire.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of dorsal rami of the otic ganglion was traced on one <b>or</b> both <b>sides</b> of 1 rhesus and 15 cynomolgus monkeys using interrupted serial sections. From 15 to 24 fine rami containing unmyelinated and small myelinated nerve fibres entered the cranial cavity with the mandibular nerve through the foramen ovale. Most rami {{contributed to a}} plexus positioned in the crotch of the mandibular and maxillary nerves adjacent to the trigeminal ganglion. The plexus was augmented by an accessory otic ganglion. Rami then continued dorsally <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of <b>or</b> through the maxillary nerve and joined the cavernous sinus plexus. The pathway described probably gives otic parasympathetic fibres access to the cerebral arteries and may share a wider distribution in common with other nerves contributing to the cavernous sinus plexus...|$|R
5000|$|Yellow flowers form on panicles from June to September. Panicles {{are smaller}} than the leaves, and growing from the forks of leaves or {{at the end of}} branchlets. The fruit is a brown woody capsule, 7 to 10 cm long. Opening up in 5 valves. Each valve has a woody middle divide, and <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> are two <b>or</b> three seeds. Seeds {{includes}} thin seed [...] "wings", which surround the heavier central part of the seed. Seeds dispersed by wind. Germination from fresh seed is relatively swift and reliable. Germination commences after three weeks, with an 85% success rate after two months.|$|R
50|$|Crash cymbals were {{traditionally}} {{placed on the}} left side of the drum set (for a right-handed drummer), since the normally larger ride cymbal is usually on the right, however some drummers set up their crash on the right. Often a drummer will have multiple crashes, and so may set them up with one or two <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> less commonly, with one mounted very closely above another, usually larger crash or ride.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier {{the iron}} ore {{transport}} from the mines in Ghelari to the chutes and tipplers of the ironworks from Govăjdia {{was done by}} horses with two baskets attached <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> other hired carriers until the demand and the price for the transported iron ore rose in 1859 from 18.6 Fillér/1 quintal to 53.6 Fillér/1 quintal of transported iron ore. Because of the rising expenses for the transportation of iron ore, the administration was forced to replace the transport system.|$|E

40|$|This {{new species}} is closely allied to and {{strongly}} resembles Schizorrhina Whitei Thoms. (= Emiliae Thoms. ¹) nec White) {{of the same}} locality, but can at once be distinguished by the different shape of the elytra which are broadly truncated posteriorly, and strongly spined at the suture. Length 18 mm.; breadth at the shoulders 9, 25 mm. — Entirely of a bright metallic green, spotted and striped with fulvous-yellow in the following manner, which however will probably prove to vary individually as in the allied species: on the head: a small spot between the eyes; on the pronotum: the thickened lateral margins without however reaching the hind margin, a narrow irregularly edged line <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> more <b>or</b> less parallel with the lateral margins and divided into three spots of which the anterior and intermediate ones are of an elongated shape, the posterior one of a transverse triangular shape, and two square somewhat obliquely directed spots before the median lobe...|$|R
50|$|In the US and less-so in Canada, {{nearly all}} new pickups are sold with {{automatic}} transmissions. The Cummins diesel-equipped Ram {{is the only}} full-size pickup truck available with a manual transmission. It has an ultra-low first-gear ratio for heavy hauling. The Chevrolet Colorado, Nissan Frontier, and Toyota Tacoma are available with a clutch, Fords are automatic only.A regular cab has a single row of seats and a single set of doors, one <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Extended <b>or</b> super cab pickups add an extra space behind the main seat, sometimes including small seats. The first extended cab truck in the U.S. was called the Club Cab and introduced by Chrysler in 1973 on Dodge trucks. A crew cab, or double cab, seats five or six and has two full-size front-hinged doors on both sides. The first crew cab truck in the U.S. was made by International Harvester in 1957 and was later followed by Dodge in 1963, Ford in 1965 and Chevrolet in 1973.|$|R
2500|$|The DLR is {{operated}} by 145 high-floor bi-directional single-articulated Electric Multiple Units (EMUs). Each car has four doors <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> and two <b>or</b> three cars {{make up a}} train. There are no cabs because normal operations are automated, and a small driver's console is concealed behind a locked panel at each end, from which the PSA can drive the car. Consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train.
