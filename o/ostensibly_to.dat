5|$|Augustus {{also created}} the Praetorian Guard: nine cohorts, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|Otto pursued policies, such as {{balancing}} power {{among all the}} parties and sharing offices among the parties, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{the power of the}} parties while trying to bring a pro-Othon party into being. The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability.|$|E
5|$|A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush is a 1958 book by the English travel writer Eric Newby. It is an autobiographical {{account of}} his adventures in the Hindu Kush, around the Nuristan {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> make the first mountaineering ascent of Mir Samir. It {{has been described as}} a comic masterpiece, intensely English, and understated. Publications including The Guardian and The Telegraph list it among the greatest travel books of all time. It has sold over 500,000 copies in paperback.|$|E
50|$|He was {{the first}} emperor <b>to</b> <b>ostensibly</b> retire <b>to</b> a monastery, but in fact {{continue}} to exert considerable influence over his successor. This process would become known as cloistered rule.|$|R

5|$|In October 2008 President Fernández de Kirchner nationalised private {{pension funds}} for almost $30 billion, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> protect the {{pensions}} from falling stock prices around the world, although critics {{said the government}} simply wanted to add the money to its budget. Private pension funds, which were first licensed in 1994, suffered large losses during the 19982002 crisis and by 2008, the state subsidized 77% of the funds' beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Military flights {{also used}} Fairbanks as a base. In 1920, {{the first flight}} from the {{continental}} United States to Alaska used Fairbanks as a base. In 1934, a flight of Martin B-10 bombers flew from Washington, D.C. to Fairbanks, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the feasibility of long-range bomber deployments. In reality, the bombers flew photographic missions intended to scout locations for military airfields {{to be built in}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew. Instead, Berg sneaked onto the roof of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E

5|$|Once Emperor, Domitian {{immediately}} {{sought to}} attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, {{he went to}} Gaul, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> conduct a census, and suddenly ordered {{an attack on the}} Chatti. For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75kilometres (46mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{secret service}} {{defector}} Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> derail the peace process, {{which would have}} resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but he offered {{no evidence to support}} the accusation. Russian and Armenian officials denied this claims.|$|E
5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of the slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
50|$|At the 1949 federal {{election}} the Chifley Government lost power, <b>ostensibly</b> due <b>to</b> the problems regarding this legislation and the Court case.|$|R
50|$|A Fine and Private Place was a {{proposed}} feature film from Paul Watson that was abandoned during filming, <b>ostensibly</b> due <b>to</b> poor weather.|$|R

5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> examine their character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view}} to expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E
5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> break up the demonstrations, but in reality {{to prepare for a}} military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall. At first his treatment was poor, but Allen wrote a letter, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> the Continental Congress, describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way. Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the men should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was {{the final}} and most devastating of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. The {{previous}} war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrow II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrow proceeded to declare war, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia, the Aegean Sea and even before the walls of Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> defend the southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The {{mission of the}} ground forces was expanded to combat operations and, from that point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and the escalation of ground operations in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The office formulates two {{plans to}} save their jobs. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is tasked with {{tracking}} down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the emails before California {{has a chance to}} view them, while Andy, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) head to Schrute Farms, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> try and change Dwight's mind. However, Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device, saying she knows Dwight and is confident that he will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} further stamps were issued in 1968 and 1969 inscribed BIAFRA or REPUBLIC OF BIAFRA, {{including}} miniature sheets, further overprints and stamps <b>ostensibly</b> issued <b>to</b> {{raise funds for}} charity.|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed ''. Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of Empress Catherine, Şahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these {{settlers}} {{had been sent to}} Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of Şahin as Khan. Local residents banded together to prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against Şahin. He sent the new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on Şahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> preserve the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni-Kale in February 1778, crushing the revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was forced to flee. Şahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, and now, with the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, <b>ostensibly</b> <b>to</b> defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E
