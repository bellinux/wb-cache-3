5|$|In 1908, {{the number}} of {{attendees}} at St. Peter Church began to dwindle. Many of the priests who had served the congregation had been reassigned a few years earlier. In 1908, a popular priest, Father Sacchi, was sent to Mother of Sorrows Church in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Parishioners formed a committee to go speak to the Bishop <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Sacchi's behalf. Although Father Sacchi {{was not allowed to}} return to St. Peter, Reverend James Vocca, who had also been at St. Peter prior to his reassignment, was brought back to the church.|$|E

25|$|The ever-growing {{number of}} German-speaking {{immigrants}} necessitated a larger church. The second Church of St. Nicholas {{was built in}} 1848 in the Gothic Revival style and on December 24 dedicated by Archbishop Hughes. The schoolhouse was built in 1867. <b>On</b> <b>Father</b> Buchmeyer's death he was succeeded by Father Krebesz, also a Capuchin, and upon {{the death of the}} latter in 1876, Father Francis J. Shadier became pastor, assisted by Revs. Anthony Lamell and John B. Mayer. In 1879 Father Nicholas Sorg became pastor, and was succeeded by Father Mayer, P.R., in 1888. Rev. John A. Nageleisen took charge in 1908.|$|E

The group also celebrated the first Children's Planet Award Gala and its focus on the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted on 20 November 1989.|$|E
25|$|His first {{assignment}} {{was to the}} mission at Sillery. In 1686 {{he was assigned to}} the mission to Ottawas of the Great Lakes.

There from 1689 <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Aveneau {{spent the better part of}} his life. Fort St. Joseph was established nearby in 1697.

25|$|On February 8, 1945, {{prior to}} the end of World War II, Orsenigo moved to Eichstätt, in Bavaria. The nunciature lost its {{official}} status in May 1945, with the defeat of Nazi Germany, although the Allied Control Council allowed Orsenigo to remain in Eichstätt. Orsenigo died in Eichstätt on April 1, 1946, leaving his aide de camp, Monsignor Carlo Colli as the only remaining link between Pius XII and the German Church. Colli died in January 1947, leaving his secretary Monsignor Bernard Hack alone in Eichstätt. After a lengthy interregnum, during which Pius XII relied <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Igo Ziegler at the Villa Grosch in Kronberg, the next nuncio would be Aloisius Joseph Muench.|$|E
500|$|Lee Percy {{served as}} editor of the film. He said the final cuts {{provided}} to him already contained the actors' strongest performances, but that he placed a greater focus <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> John's character in an effort to [...] "help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally". Percy was assisted by editor Scott Ferril. Patrick Coyle's father, Jim, followed production of the film closely, making weekly calls to inquire about it. When his father's health started to decline, Patrick Coyle [...] "worked like hell" [...] to finish the film quickly so his father could see it before he died. The film was finished in December 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{trustees}} soon renounced the agreement. When word of {{the compromise}} reached the Holy See, the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had {{had little to do}} with the compromise, which he blamed <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Michael Hurley and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall. Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place. The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop. By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the [...] "old and confused" [...] Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland. In 1827, the Vatican's Propaganda Fide formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well. They summoned Conwell to Rome.|$|E

500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E

The protagonist's ignorance of his father is compared to his son's inability to understand him; {{the lack of information}} about his father's story makes the task impossible to complete, but capable of endless repetition, and, [...] "repetition becomes the fabric of the stories".|$|E
2500|$|Preparations for {{receiving}} {{the bodies of}} the USS Maine began in June 1911. Captain James D. Tilford and undertaker Oliver B. Jenkins of Washington, D.C., took charge of the remains in Havana. They were assisted by the Maine former chaplain, Father John Chidwick. Their plan was to place each set of remains in a coffin, which would be kept under guard at the La Cabaña fortress. The assumption of many involved in the operation was that the USS Leonidas would take the remains to the United States (just as it did other relics from the ship). Tilford and Jenkins ordered 25 coffins from the United States, believing that most of the 75 missing bodies had been blown far out into the harbor by the explosion and would not be recovered. (Their assumption was based, in part, <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Chidwick's testimony that he saw bodies blown as high as [...] into the air by the explosion.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In spring 2000, LucasArts began {{production}} of Full Throttle: Payback, an official sequel {{to continue the}} storyline of Full Throttle. Since Tim Schafer had already left the company at the time, Larry Ahern, {{who was involved in}} the original game's development, was appointed the project lead and Bill Tiller, the art director. The story would have focused on Ben's efforts to foil a plan by a [...] "large corporation" [...] and the local governor to replace all paved highways with hover pads, robbing the bikers and truckers of their traditional ground. In {{the first half of the}} game, Ben would have prevented an assassination attempt <b>on</b> <b>Father</b> Torque, who now leads the anti-hovercraft rally, then team up with a [...] "persistent undercover female reporter" [...] to bring down the villainous governor. In Tiller's opinion, Payback [...] "was going to capture the feel of the first game yet expand upon the milieu". At the early stages, the project received positive feedback from other LucasArts employees but according to Tiller, it eventually fell apart because of disagreements on the game style between the production team and [...] "a particularly influential person" [...] within the management, which led to a series of [...] "mistakes". The production ceased in November 2000, when 25% of the levels and about 40% of the preproduction art were complete. LucasArts never released an official statement regarding the game cancellation. Both Ahern and Tiller left LucasArts in 2001, after Payback was cancelled.|$|E
