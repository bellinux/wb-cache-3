5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as <b>oil</b> <b>pollution,</b> predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. <b>Oil</b> <b>pollution</b> threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> {{in the sea}} {{comes from}} cities and industry. Oil is {{dangerous}} for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to <b>oil</b> <b>pollution.</b> Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} petroleum products accidently or deliberately released in the environment varies considerably with time under the action of biological (biodegradation) and physico-chemical (photo-oxidation) processes. It {{becomes more and more}} difficult to trace the origin of the oil spilled. A technique widely used for monitoring ancient <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> is the study of oil biomarkers like terpanes and steranes^ 1, 2 ^. Here we show that the geochemical technique of asphaltenes pyrolysis can be successfully applied to environmental samples. This method allows the reconstitution of the original oil from the asphaltenes fraction of severely degraded oil residues. We applied the two techniques: biomarkers analysis and pyrolysis of asphaltenes to the long-term characterisation of the _Amoco Cadiz_ oil 23 years after the spill in the salt marshes of Ile Grande, Northern Brittany, France. The results show that the oil reached the ultimate degradation stage. The total biodegradation rate was 60 % relatively to initial oil. The asphaltenes pyrolysis generated a gas-chromatographic profile very similar to the original _Amoco Cadiz_ oil. In the biomarkers fraction, gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analyses demonstrated that terpanes were conserved whereas steranes were partly degraded. We also showed that the class of seco-hopanes biomarkers are conserved and can be used in the long term monitoring of <b>oil</b> <b>pollutions...</b>|$|R

25|$|According to the International Maritime Organisation {{oil spills}} can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention {{recognized}} that most <b>oil</b> <b>pollution</b> resulted from routine shipboard operations {{such as the}} cleaning of cargo tanks. In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended {{by means of an}} amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO.

It is argued that present <b>oil</b> spill <b>pollution</b> laws are coercive and militant and do not encourage communities in the Eastern Niger Delta to act as pressure groups for a clean environment. The paper posits that environmental damages resulting from oil spills can be minimized through co-operative action between and amongst stakeholders-government,oil companies and community representatives.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pollutions</b> {{impact the}} environment, {{the economy and}} {{the quality of life for}} coastal inhabitants. The {{increasing}} importance of petroleum products and the list of oil spill events in last two decades raised the concern on maritime safety and environmental protection. Indeed, annually, on average 1, 300, 000 t of oil entered the oceans during the 1990 s with tanker vessel spills accounting for 100, 000 t, run-off 140, 000 t, and pipeline leaks just 12, 000 t. Aside from natural seeps, which contribute an estimated 600, 000 t or ~ 45 % of total emissions, other important sources include vessel operational discharges. For these reasons, there has been an increasing interest in frameworks for remotely detect oil spill at sea and several technological advances were made, especially under the propulsion of catastrophic events, like the Deep Water Horizon spill, during which several remote sensing technologies moved up to the technological readiness scale...|$|R
