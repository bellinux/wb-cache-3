5|$|The atlas {{was not an}} {{immediate}} success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted {{and there were no}} detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps. Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book</b> Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard {{published}} {{three more}} books {{about love and}} faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries {{to see if the}} new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book,</b> is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.|$|E
25|$|The Question of Separatism {{incorporated}} {{and expanded}} Jacobs’ {{presentation of the}} 1979 Massey Lectures, entitled Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association.

This {{was in fact the}} first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist Richard Gwyn advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the 1980 referendum was just defeated by a vote of 60%). The Question of Separatism was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in The Globe and Mail.|$|E

Towards the climax <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book,</b> Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War.

He also appears with Lupin and Tonks at the very end, when they give the Dursleys a warning concerning their treatment of Harry. Moody only features briefly in Half-Blood Prince. In Deathly Hallows he is killed by Voldemort after being abandoned by Mundungus Fletcher, who was acting as a Potter decoy. The Order is unable to recover his body; but later his magical eye is found by Harry mounted on Dolores Umbridge's office door to spy on Ministry of Magic employees.

25|$|A book {{attributed}} to Ardashir about {{the bases of}} government is written in an Arabic translation in the book Nahayat-ol Aarab and the warriors (Asawereh), writers (Kottab), Judges (Gozat), invasion (Bo'uth va Thoghur), accepting ambassadors (Fi Godum-el Vofud alayhe men gabl-e Moluk) constructing cities (Bana-ol Modon), his strategy for noble houses (Tadbirohu fi Ahl-e Boyutat-el Sharaf), complaint (Mazalem) and development of lands (Tadbirohu Emarat-al Arzain) are discussed in it. The Persian translation <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book</b> is written in the translation of Nahayat-ol Aarab called Tajarob-ol Omam and also in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. It is not known whether the book is translated directly from Middle Persian or not. Grinaski believes that an Arabic-writing author had assembled it from different places. In order to prove his opinion, he mentions evidence that shows the influence of Islamic principles in it, for instance the writing {{in the book that}} one fifth of the war plunder is for the shah. However, since the text is written in Shahnameh, it probably existed in Khwaday-Namag too and some matters aligning with Islamic principles were added to it in the translation.|$|E
500|$|Other {{contemporary}} newspapers took separate sides on the Sword and Lord of the Rings issue. John Batchelor, {{writing for}} The Village Voice, {{thought that it}} was the weakest of the 1977 surge in fantasy, ranking it below Stephen R. Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever, Seamus Cullen's Astra and Flondrix, and The Silmarillion, edited by Christopher Tolkien, while commenting that it [...] "unabashedly cop" [...] Lord of the Rings. However, he also believed that it was serviceable, simply because there is something exciting about sending off a group to face evil alone. Taking the opposite stance, L.V. Keptert in the Sydney Morning Herald believed that the book was similar enough to Tolkien that it would draw the many fans <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book</b> to Sword, but it was only similar on a most basic level, and a valid comparison could not be made between the two. The Pittsburgh Press took a similar stance, saying that Sword embodied the Tolkien spirit and tradition but was quite able to stand apart from Lord of the Rings.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 American {{young adult}} novel The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins {{has been accused}} of being strikingly similar to Battle Royale in terms of the basic plot premise. While Collins {{maintains}} that she [...] "had never heard <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book</b> until her book was turned in", Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff," [...] but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of The Hunger Games film adaptation.

500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted.

500|$|Adams' art {{style is}} {{noted for its}} high level of detail, {{and he has a}} {{reputation}} of being a [...] "tight" [...] penciller. He states that he works at a slow pace, which limits the amount of work he does. When he penciled Fantastic Four #347–349 in 1990 for regular writer/illustrator Walter Simonson, who needed a break in order to catch up on his own work on that title, Adams managed to pencil the first two issues in five weeks and four weeks, respectively, but was considerably late on the third. In 1997 Adams stated that he could produce a page of either pencils or inks in a day. In a 2007 interview, he stated he tends to produce ⅔ to ¾ of a page a day, and can also ink at that rate, but can do up to two pages in a day if he is under pressure, as when he produced Cloak and Dagger #9 (1986) in 22 days, for example. Another example is the 1989 one-shot , which due to changing deadlines, he completed at a quicker pace. Adams singles out one page <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>book</b> that he drew a half-hour as his personal record for speed, but decries its poor quality. Adams is also noted for the humor in his work, as with, for example, the extraneous characters he places in cameo appearances in the backgrounds of his comics, as when he drew Gumby in the panels of Longshot, or the forms in which he depicted the shapeshifting alien Warlock in his The New Mutants work.|$|E

[...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it.
