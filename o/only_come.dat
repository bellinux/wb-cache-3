Homer, however, saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together. Ultimately, the kids do not care for this one and wind up watching Itchy & Scratchy while Homer and Marge share a moment together.|$|E
5|$|The Stoic view of fate {{is entirely}} {{based on a}} view of the {{universe}} as a whole.

5|$|In 1986, Eastwood co-starred with Marsha Mason in the {{military}} drama Heartbreak Ridge, about the 1983United States invasion of Grenada. He portrays an United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant veteran of the Korean War and Vietnam War who realizes he is {{nearing the end of}} his military service. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense who expressed contempt for the film. At the time, the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has <b>only</b> <b>come</b> to be viewed more favorably in recent times. The film grossed $70million domestically.|$|E

5000|$|Around 16,850 BP, the Puget Lobe began {{retreating}} northward {{at a rate}} {{of about}} 340 meters (1,120 feet) per year. [...] By about 16,650 BP, the glacier <b>only</b> <b>came</b> down to present-day Olympia. [...] The Puget Lobe began to uncover Glacial Lake Russell. By 16,450 BP, the Puget Lobe <b>only</b> <b>came</b> down to Tacoma. By 16,150 BP, the glacier <b>only</b> <b>came</b> down to Seattle. [...] By about 16,000 BP, the Puget Lobe retreated far enough north that Glacial Lake Russell and the Straight of Juan de Fuca became connected, making Glacial Lake Russell the salt water body of Puget Sound again.|$|R
5|$|Laforey's {{success was}} {{considered}} impressive by historian William James, as his ship carried only 28 nine-pounder cannon {{in contrast with}} L'Huillier's 32 twelve-pounder guns and four 24-pounder carronades. Castor was also a larger ship with a slightly larger crew, and although L'Huillier and his men had only been aboard for ten days, the crew of Carysfort had <b>only</b> <b>come</b> together immediately before the cruise and had not had much longer to become acquainted with their vessel than the French crew.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} the horse tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had <b>only</b> <b>come</b> to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that the horse tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of the horse.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{competitions}} around the world, the Copa Libertadores historically {{did not use}} extra time, or away goals. From 1960 to 1987, two-legged ties were decided on points (teams would be awarded 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss), without taking goal difference into consideration. If both teams were level on points after two legs, a third match would be played at a neutral venue. Goal difference would <b>only</b> <b>come</b> into play if the third match was drawn. If the third match did not produce an immediate winner, a penalty shootout {{was used to determine}} a winner.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Yogyakarta, Darwis (now played by Lukman Sardi) changes his name to Ahmad Dahlan and begins {{teaching}} Islam, preaching that prayers need <b>only</b> <b>come</b> from inner peace and do not require large donations or sacrifices. Conflict soon arises between Dahlan and the local kyais (religious leaders) after he shows that {{the direction in which}} they pray is wrong, pointing not to the Kaaba in Mecca but to Africa. The kyais, especially Cholil Kamaludiningrat (Slamet Rahardjo), decry Dahlan as the leader of a cult and provoke a crowd of their followers to destroy the building next to Dahlan's house used for studying prayer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have <b>only</b> <b>come</b> later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would <b>only</b> <b>come</b> after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{government}} may occur during the campaign, for example {{as a consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may <b>only</b> <b>come</b> into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the middle or upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to side with the rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations. While religion no longer plays a central role (as in Medieval II: Total War), it is still important in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in influencing diplomatic relations between nations.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{playing in}} 168 cinemas, Dr. No grossed $840,000 {{in just two}} weeks and wound up being the fifth most popular movie of the year there. The box office results in {{mainland}} Europe were also positive. The film ended up grossing $6 million, making it a financial success compared to its $1 million budget. The original North American gross rental was $2 million, increasing to $6 million after its first reissue in 1965, as a double feature with From Russia with Love. The following reissue was in 1966 paired with Goldfinger, to compensate {{the fact that the}} next Bond movie would <b>only</b> <b>come</b> out in the following year. The total gross of Dr. No ended up being $59.6 million worldwide, IGN listed it as sixth-best Bond film ever, Entertainment Weekly put it at seventh among Bond films, and Norman Wilner of MSN as twelfth best. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 51 reviews and judged 96% of the reviews as positive. President John F. Kennedy was a fan of Ian Fleming's novels and requested a private showing of Dr. No in the White House.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could <b>only</b> <b>come</b> up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should <b>only</b> <b>come</b> if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
