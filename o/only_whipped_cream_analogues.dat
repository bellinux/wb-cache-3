50|$|Cream pies {{are often}} {{associated}} with comedians who use them as a gimmick in their routines, with the pie being pushed against someone's face. When used for show business purposes, cream pies are generally mock-up pies made from <b>only</b> canned <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> or sometimes the less expensive shaving cream. Pieing is the act of throwing a pie at a person or people. This can be a political action when the target is an authority figure, politician, or celebrity {{and can be used}} as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim. In most or all US jurisdictions, pieing is punishable as battery, and may constitute assault as well. Some political activists throw cream pies onto the faces of politicians to shame them and humiliate them (e.g., les Entartistes).|$|R

50|$|In Europe, where {{production}} {{and use of}} <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers originated, there are presently 3 factories involved in its production. Standard size for <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers is 8 grams of nitrous oxide per cartridge. <b>Whipped</b> <b>cream</b> chargers are intended for low-volume or occasional use, such as home kitchens, restaurants, and coffee shop applications.

40|$|Vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are {{nowadays}} {{a popular}} {{alternative to the}} traditional dairy <b>whipped</b> <b>creams.</b> The emulsions standing {{at the base of}} vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are classified as O/W emulsions. During whipping air is incorporated and entrapped by a fat crystallize network. This is achieved by the fat droplets interaction through the partial coalescence mechanism. Hence the presence of a crystalline fat phase is imperative within the formulation of the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> In order to control the partial coalescence and stabilize both the emulsion and the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> emulsifiers are required. Therefore in such systems, proteins and LMW surfactants coexists and dictate the degree and rate of partial coalesce. This allows the tailoring of the sensorial attributes and physico-chemical properties of the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> (e. g. stability, overrun, texture). Nevertheless the impact of the components on the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> properties has to be understood as a whole and not as individual effects of fats, proteins and LMW surfactants...|$|R

40|$|<b>Whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which by whipping can be formed to a foam by {{the incorporation of}} air into the system. Traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are made out of milk but today imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat has gained {{a large share of}} the marked due to their many benefits compared to traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> Imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are both cheaper and more flexible than traditionally creams. By vary the characteristics of the fat system and the cream recipe the properties of the imitation creams can be adapted to fit the purpose of a specific product. The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of how different types of fat systems and other ingredients affect the properties of imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat. This was done by studying three vegetable fat systems with different physicochemical properties. The properties of the fat systems were characterized and the three fat systems were then used for making different imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> The properties of the creams were characterized and the properties of the fat systems and the creams were assessed and compared with each other. The study showed that the fat characteristics that generally seem to have the highest impact on the properties of <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are the structure, the solid fat content and the crystallization temperature of the fat. A fat solution with a hard structure, a high crystallization temperature and a high solid fat content at a wide range of temperatures overall seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with the best properties. This as these fat properties provide the creams with a high foam stability, a high overrun and a short whipping time. This study has also shown that other ingredients than the fat systems provide the creams with diverging properties. This is best shown by the results of the freeze-thaw stability which indicate that a recipe with a high amount of sugar seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with good freeze-thaw stability. Other properties of the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> also seem to be very much influenced by other ingredients than the fat systems but further studies are needed to provide clarity to the complexity of the interplay of the ingredients in <b>whipped</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R
