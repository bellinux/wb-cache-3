5|$|A {{calculated}} {{titration curve}} for <b>oxalic</b> acid is {{shown at the}} right. <b>Oxalic</b> acid has pKa values of 1.27 and 4.27. Therefore, the buffer regions will be centered at about pH 1.3 and pH 4.3. The buffer regions carry the information necessary to get the pKa values as the concentrations of acid and conjugate base change along a buffer region.|$|E
5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of <b>oxalic</b> acid, a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to <b>oxalic</b> acid. <b>Oxalic</b> acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of <b>oxalic</b> acid—a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid—into the soil around its woody substrate. This chemical stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, as the organic matter in soil breaks down into smaller molecules. This influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are <b>oxalic</b> acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When broken down by the body it results in glycolic acid and <b>oxalic</b> acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, <b>oxalic</b> acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: <b>oxalic,</b> citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due {{probably}} {{to a combination of}} various organic acids (such as <b>oxalic,</b> citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, phenolic compounds and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps. Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study. Porcini were thought to have anti-cancer properties according to Hungarian research conducted in the 1950s, but later investigations in the United States did not support this.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} {{the age of}} a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to {{the activity of the}} standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is <b>oxalic</b> acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though {{not nearly as}} often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of <b>oxalic</b> acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as <b>oxalic</b> acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of <b>oxalic</b> acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

25|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>oxalic</b> acid {{is due to}} kidney failure caused by precipitation of solid calcium oxalate, {{the main component of}} kidney stones. <b>Oxalic</b> acid can also cause joint pain due to the formation of similar precipitates in the joints. Ingestion of ethylene glycol results in <b>oxalic</b> acid as a metabolite which can also cause acute kidney failure.|$|E

25|$|The {{preparation}} of salts of <b>oxalic</b> acid from plants had been known, at the latest, since 1745, when the Dutch botanist and physician Herman Boerhaave isolated a salt from sorrel. By 1773, François Pierre Savary of Fribourg, Switzerland had isolated <b>oxalic</b> acid from its salt in sorrel.|$|E
25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated <b>oxalic</b> acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% <b>oxalic</b> acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces <b>oxalic</b> acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxalic</b> acid's main {{applications}} include cleaning or bleaching, {{especially for}} the removal of rust (iron complexing agent). Bar Keepers Friend {{is an example of a}} household cleaner containing <b>oxalic</b> acid. Its utility in rust removal agents is due to its forming a stable, water-soluble salt with ferric iron, ferrioxalate ion.|$|E
