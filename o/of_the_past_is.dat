500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for The Dissolve analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, sometimes we deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating our memories of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of confabulation. Leonard's use of confabulation poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento we are faced with the question of how much of Leonard's memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group on}} the beach begin {{flashing}} through time, landing in fourteen different times throughout the Island's past and future {{in the span of}} about a week before the wheel is turned again; however, according to fellow freighter science team member physicist Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> changed because their suddenly appearing in various times is what had always happened. [...] The survivors settle in 1974, by which point only Miles, Faraday, former Other Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and 815 passengers James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) remain; Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) and Vincent the dog (Pono) also survive, but they are physically separated and do not meet any of them again for three years until July 1977. [...] Miles and his group move into the Barracks and pseudonymously join the DHARMA Initiative, an organization conducting scientific research while living there that would eventually be purged in 1992 by Ben and the Others. [...] Despite the option to board the DHARMA submarine and [...] "go back to the real world", the survivors from 2004 stay on the island together in the hope that they can somehow return to the time that they knew. Miles becomes a security officer and ends up becoming friends with Sawyer. [...] He discovers that his mother and father Dr. Pierre Chang live on the island as part of DHARMA and his father is even the man in the organization's station-specific orientation films; however, Miles does not approach or befriend his father, continuing to harbor resentment for his absence from much of Miles's life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{past and}} present are {{constantly}} intertwined in The House in Paris, and the middle section, [...] "The Past," [...] is an imagined history. Characters in the past already have in mind future characters and events. For example, hours after conceiving Leopold, Karen thinks about her son as if he already exists: [...] "the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." [...] This thought of Karen's is, in the end, Leopold's, since he imagines these events; the reader learns Leopold's past while he does, [...] "simultaneously gaining information from disconnected fragments derived {{from a combination of}} hints and opinions filtered through all he experiences in the house in Paris." [...] Bowen herself discussed the [...] "bendability" [...] of time in an essay published in 1951, in which she discusses [...] "factitious memory": [...] "one route to the past (or the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past)</b> <b>is</b> factitious memory. That is to say, by art we are made to seem to remember that which we have not actually known." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many of my colleagues. As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame everybody out of being so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to understand how they manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion.
