50|$|This two-storey Baroque mansion {{was built}} {{in the first half of}} the 18th century on two parcels of medieval land. It was built using Gothic and Renaissance masonry from {{previous}} buildings. The mansion was built by the Count of Torna County, Joseph Keglevich.From 1601 to 1608 the <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> S. Alter. By the 18th century, the ownership had changed several times. In 1634, the <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Thomas Baranay. From 1646 to 1656, the <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> H. Ch. Pärtinger.|$|R
5|$|By 2004, the <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms of explosives to the building for its demolition and watch the explosion as a deterrent measure.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball.

5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 <b>owners</b> <b>were</b> able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700.
