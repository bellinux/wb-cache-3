The knives are arranged radially in the cylindrical <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> such that their cutting edges protrude from the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> {{so that they will}} come into contact with the board being cut as the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> spins. The <b>cutter</b> <b>head's</b> axis of rotation is parallel to the table surfaces and perpendicular to the feed direction. The knives cut into the board in the direction opposite to the feed.|$|R

50|$|A {{thickness}} planer {{consists of}} three elements: a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> which contains the cutting knives; a set of rollers which draw the board through the machine; and a table which is adjustable relative to the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to control the resultant thickness of the board.

40|$|Geotechnical risks play an {{important}} role in the selection of tunneling method and machine types. In order to prevent some geological and geotechnical hazards during tunneling, selecting the most appropriate tunneling machine is very important. In this research study the main geotechnical hazards of tunneling by roadheader with their common mitigation measures are discussed. At present, three roadheader are excavating the three drifts of the Tabas coal mine in Iran. Hence, these drifts were used in this research study. The risk assessment matrix method in these tunnels showed that there is a lower risk of tunneling by roadheader than utilising the drilling and blasting method. The determined geotechnical risk assessment showed that the transverse <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> was more suitable in comparison to a longitudinal <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> for such tunnels. Then by using an instantaneous cutting rate model, the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> power of the roadheader was determined. According to the model, a lightweight roadheader with a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> power of about 80 - 110 KW and 40 t weight are suitable. Finally, four types of manufactured roadheader with similar specifications were selected...|$|R

50|$|In hard rock, either {{shielded}} or open-type TBMs can be used. Hard rock TBMs excavate {{rock with}} disc cutters {{mounted in the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> The disc <b>cutters</b> create compressive stress fractures in the rock, causing it to chip away from the tunnel face. The excavated rock (muck) is transferred through openings in the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> to a belt conveyor, where it runs through the machine {{to a system of}} conveyors or muck cars for removal from the tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|The 1950s also {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the product that Braun is most known for today: the electric shaver. The S 50 was the first electric shaver from Braun. The shaver was designed in 1938, but World War II delayed its introduction until 1951. It featured an <b>oscillating</b> <b>cutter</b> block with a very thin, yet very stable steel-foil mounted above it. This principle is still used in Braun's shavers of today.|$|R
50|$|Fundamentally, a jointer's table {{arrangement}} is designed with two levels like a narrower thickness planer {{so that it}} consists of two long, narrow parallel tables in a row with a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> recessed between them, but with a side guide. This <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> is typically driven by an electric induction motor. (Older machines were driven by belts from line shafts.) A moveable fence is normally set perpendicular to the tables, though some models may allow settings (adjustments) to various angles.|$|R
50|$|In operation, {{the board}} to be jointed is held with its face against the fence and the edge to be jointed resting on the infeed table. The board is fed across the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> and onto the outfeed table. The knives in the {{revolving}} <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> remove an amount of material {{and the relationship of}} the two tables and the fence keeps the board oriented {{in such a way that}} the result is an edge which is flat along its length and perpendicular to the board's face.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} and versatile types of modern dredges is the cutter suction dredge. Specific regulations mandate the placement of screens over the suction mouth during dredging operations to prevent ordnance, wildlife, and other debris from entering the system; however, these screens change the operational capability of the dredge {{in the form of}} an additional minor loss. The goal of this experiment was to determine the effects of different dredge operating parameters ? <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speed, ladder arm swing speed, flow rate, and screen opening area ratio ? on a screen?s calculated minor loss coefficient (or k-value). The Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory and Center for Dredging Studies at Texas A&M University houses a model cutter suction dredge that is used to test various parameters associated with hydraulic dredging. Testing consisted of 121 test dredge runs, which included water-only runs and slurry runs, at three flow rates, three swing speeds, three <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speeds, and three screen configurations. Minor loss coefficients were calculated for each test run and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that neither <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speed nor swing speed had a significant, direct correlation with the screen?s minor loss in the range of selected parameters; however, they did have an indirect effect on k-value through an increased specific gravity in the slurry. The screen opening area ratio (?) showed a direct correlation with the screen?s k-value and was quantified for water tests and sand tests {{in the form of an}} empirical equation which can be applied to both model and prototype cutter suction dredges. The k-values for different screen opening shapes showed an upward or downward shift in the overall k-value curves, indicating the possibility of inherent efficiencies for differently-shaped openings. Qualitative observations of the Haynes Laboratory model dredge included sediment spillage at high <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speeds and a sand bulldozer effect at low <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speeds. Future testing should focus on a wider range of <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> speeds and swing speeds to determine if any correlation exists beyond the ranges tested in this experiment. Additional testing of screens with more ?-values and different screen opening shapes would increase the resolution and precision of the proposed k-value prediction equations...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined {{the impact of}} water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable dust levels and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine was equipped with a flooded-bed dust scrubber and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. Dust levels were measured in the return airway and at locations representing the operators of the continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on dust levels, although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated dust levels, likely by {{reducing the amount of}} airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased dust levels at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels {{on both sides of the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> and in the return by limiting the quantity of ventilation airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays provided additional airflow along the off-curtain side of the machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal of gas on the curtain side of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> Use of the underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> Use of the external sprays provided the best control of respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in miner operator dust levels produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on the off-curtain side of the <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> Although the underboom sprays minimally impacted respirable dust levels, use of these sprays was not recommended because they increased face gas levels...|$|R

40|$|Dredging is a {{critical}} part of maintaining the nation?s ports and harbors that {{play a major role in}} international trade. The design of dredge equipment requires knowledge of the forces expected on an average dredge. For a cutter suction dredge one of the largest forces is applied on the <b>cutter</b> <b>head.</b> To determine the design criteria for a given cutter suction dredge the forces on the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> must be known. Forces on a 33 cm (13 inch) model <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> have been measured using a model cutter suction dredge 10. 2 cm ((4 inch)) suction and 3 inch (7. 6 cm) discharge) in the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory. The experimental results are compared to the results of a previously developed theory for estimating cutterhead forces. A MATLAB program is written and used to solve the theoretical equations. The sediment used in the study had a d 50 of 0. 27 mm and an angle of internal friction of 21. 6 ?. The sediment is contained in the deep sediment pit 7. 6 m (25 ft long), 3. 7 m wide(12 ft) and 1. 5 m deep(5 ft) in the dredge/tow tank that is 45. 7 m long(150 ft), 3. 7 m wide(12 ft), and 3. 0 m deep(10 ft). The objectives of the study are to calculate the forces using existing theory and MATLAB program and compare the theoretical results to those measured in the laboratory. The effects of the depth of cut, direction of swing, and cutter rpm on the forces acting on the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> are evaluated. The forces on the cutterhead are determined through the use of a set of six load cells rated at 13. 3 kN (3000 lb). The load cell measurements allow direct calculation of the forces on the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> through the use of static equilibrium equations with the assumption of a constant swing speed. Once the forces are determined the results can be scaled to fit an actual dredge and then be applied in the determination of dredge design characteristics. The study shows the ability of the theory to determine the forces within an order or magnitude. The theoretical forces allow design of a cutter using a factor of safety. The variability of the forces in the laboratory study shows the assumption that the cutting forces are generally steady is not always valid...|$|R
