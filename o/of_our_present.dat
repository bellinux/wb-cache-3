25|$|The free {{practice}} of eugenics could lead {{not only to}} the development of stronger individuals, but also of strains endowed with more endurance, intelligence, and courage. These strains should constitute an aristocracy, from which great men would probably appear. Modern society must promote, by all possible means, the formation of better human stock. No financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who, through the wisdom of their marriage, would engender geniuses. The complexity of our civilization is immense. No one can master all its mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have to be mastered. There is need today of men of larger mental and moral size, capable of accomplishing such a task. The establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>present</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the origin}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>present</b> system of {{numerical}} notation is ancient, {{there is no}} doubt that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, the Advance Party Report {{recommended}} a total redesign and modernisation of the uniform, commenting {{that there had}} been much criticism of [...] "the Boer War appearance of our uniforms" [...] and that the [...] "wearing of shorts by members of the Movement {{is one of the most}} damaging aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>present</b> public image". Although the Cub uniform barely changed, retaining short trousers, the Scout section were to wear a long sleeved dark green shirt and long trousers in a brownish colour described as [...] "mushroom". Venture Scouts and male Scouters had identical khaki shirts and mushroom trousers, but the neckerchief was replaced by a tie, brown for Venture Scouts and green for Scouters. Female Scouters had a dark green dress and a cap similar to those worn by airline flight attendants at the time. These recommendations were accepted and implemented from October 1967. Later amendments included khaki shirts for female Venture Scouts and Scouters, the abolition of all uniform headgear except Sea Scout caps and Air Scout berets, and black long trousers for Cubs as an option to shorts. A grey sweatshirt was introduced for the new Beaver Scout section and a dark green sweatshirt replaced the Cubs' knitted jersey. In 2001, following a consultation process within the association, a new range of uniforms designed by Meg Andrews was launched on Founder's Day, 22 February.|$|E
500|$|The {{practice}} of rifling—casting spiraling lines inside the cannon's barrel—was applied to artillery more frequently by 1855, as it gave cannon gyroscopic stability, which improved their accuracy. One {{of the earliest}} rifled cannon was the Armstrong gun—also invented by William George Armstrong—which boasted significantly improved range, accuracy, and power than earlier weapons. The projectile fired from the Armstrong gun could reportedly pierce through a ship's side, and explode inside the enemy vessel, causing increased damage, and casualties. The British military adopted the Armstrong gun, and was impressed; the Duke of Cambridge even declared that it [...] "could do everything but speak." [...] Despite being significantly more advanced than its predecessors, the Armstrong gun was rejected soon after its integration, {{in favor of the}} muzzle-loading pieces that had been in use before. While both types of gun were effective against wooden ships, neither had the capability to pierce the armor of ironclads; due to reports of slight problems with the breeches of the Armstrong gun, and their higher cost, the older muzzle-loaders were selected to remain in service, instead. Realizing that iron was more difficult to pierce with breech-loaded cannon, Armstrong designed rifled muzzle-loading guns, which proved successful; The Times reported: [...] "even the fondest believers in the invulnerability <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>present</b> ironclads were obliged to confess that against such artillery, at such ranges, their plates and sides were almost as penetrable as wooden ships." ...|$|E

Ultra small low power dissipated SET is combined with high gain and high current drivable CMOS and the write operation of the memory cell is briefly analyzed. This work is a comparative work of power consumption between conventional CMOS based SRAM and hybrid SET-CMOS based SRAM.

30|$|In this section, we {{demonstrate}} the speedup potential <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>presented</b> method to significantly speed up transient analog circuit simulations. The {{implementation of the}} presented approach was done in Infineon’s in-house SPICE simulator TITAN, and all the numerical comparisons {{were made in the}} frame of this simulator, assuring that the numerical methods are tested in the same environment. The TITAN simulator is used in productive environment and its implementation is trimmed for high performance computing, therefore the presented novel method is tested in practical productive environment, showing the true potential <b>of</b> <b>our</b> approach.|$|R

In this paper {{we present a}} study {{to solve this problem}} based on the surface extension algorithm [Computer-Aided Design 2002; 34 : 415 – 419]. Nice properties of this extension algorithm are exploited in depth and thus make our solution very simple and efficient.

These requirements, as understood here, are secularism, rationalism and science-orientation". He once again finds the philosophical development – debates and clashes – in ancient India embedded in the class struggles of the time. He discusses the materialist foundation of Vedic rituals, which he finds similar to the magical belief of controlling the natural forces through yajnas, etc. He shows how these rites and rituals that evolved as primitive scientific endeavours were transformed into superstitions and monopolies {{in the hands of}} the oppressors with the advent of class divisions.|$|E

Although the simulations were performed using sophisticated tools and incorporated most physical effects in the SPCCT system, the findings have to be proved in an in-vivo study with a real SPCCT system in future. Second, there is currently very little clinical experience with the subsequent injection of iodine-based CA and gadolinium-based CA in humans.
