Also an EU agency CEPOL (European Police College) is financed from this area. The {{second part of the}} thesis is dedicated to CEPOL.

40|$|This study emphasises {{the fact}} that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the {{financial}} statements are not compatible with the principles that establish measurement in the social sciences, and that they therefore cannot be considered to be measurement <b>objectives.</b> The concept <b>of</b> measurement presupposes the comprehension of the principal state and consequently the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> a measurement discipline only make measurement sense {{in the presence of a}} theory of measurement in which they are contained. Currently, accounting is considered to be a measurement discipline with complete measurement objectives, even in the absence of a measurement theory that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the measurement process. In this study the principles of the representational theory of measurement (a theory that establishes measurement in the social sciences) are used to emphasise that the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the financial statements are not measurement objectives unless they are supported by a theory of measurement. Hence the financial statements cannot contain measurement information until a theory of measurement is established that incorporates the <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> the accounting measurement processes.
