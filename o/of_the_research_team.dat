5|$|James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, {{university}} professor, {{research scientist}} and inventor. Cade, {{a native of}} Texas, earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the University of Texas, and became {{a professor of medicine}} and nephrology at the University of Florida. Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered as the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> that created the sports drink Gatorade. Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.|$|E
25|$|The University of Florida {{has been}} portrayed in several books, movies and {{television}} shows. In addition, the University of Florida campus has been the backdrop {{for a number of}} different books and movies. Robert Cade, a professor in the university's College of Medicine, was the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> that invented the ubiquitous sports drink Gatorade as a hydration supplement for the Florida Gators football team in 1965–66.|$|E
25|$|Kent, Howard Hansen, the Riglers, and Curtiss readily {{acknowledged}} {{that it had been}} extremely difficult to determine the course of the study, but maintained that all disputes during the meetings were impersonal and typical of scientific discourse. David Rigler said that, despite his disagreements with Shurley, Shurley's early recommendations were the only useful advice he received on handling Genie and he attempted to follow them as much as possible. The Riglers and Curtiss further stated that everyone involved in Genie's life, with the exception of Jean Butler Ruch, worked together as best they could to rehabilitate Genie and never fought with each other, and independently denied allegations of factionalism. Ruch never stated a motive for her actions, but members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> believed they were due to her anger over her foster custody rejection and her perception that Children's Hospital staff influenced the decision. The role of the scientists in Genie's case has become the source of debate within the scientific community.|$|E

25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain about {{most of her life}} from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E

2500|$|Susan Curtiss {{said that}} in late December 1977 she had been {{asked if she could}} be Genie's legal {{guardian}} but that, after she met with Genie on January 3, 1978, Genie's mother suddenly stopped allowing her and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> from seeing Genie again, immediately ending all testing and observations. On March 30, 1978, without consulting John Miner authorities officially transferred guardianship to her mother, and she subsequently forbade all of the scientists except for Jay Shurley from seeing her or Genie. [...] Jean Butler Ruch remained in contact with Genie's mother and continued to spread negative rumors about Genie's condition, especially targeting Curtiss, until 1986, when a stroke left Ruch with aphasia. Ruch died in 1988 following another stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{people who}} worked with Genie, {{including}} Curtiss and James Kent, harshly criticized Rymer's works. A late April 1993 New York Times review of Rymer's book from scientific reporter Natalie Angier, which took an extremely negative view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team,</b> prompted David Rigler to write his first public account of his involvement in Genie's case. In his letter to the Times, published in mid-June 1993, Rigler wrote that Genie was doing well in a small, private facility where her mother regularly visited her. He also stated that he and Marilyn were in contact with Genie's mother and had recently reestablished contact with Genie, writing that Genie was happy and that on their first visit she immediately greeted him and Marilyn by name, and said that, [...] "my wife and I have resumed our (now infrequent) visits with Genie and her mother." ...|$|E

Donald Rumbelow criticised the claim, saying that no shawl is listed among Eddowes's effects by the police, and mitochondrial DNA expert Peter Gill said the shawl [...] "is of dubious origin and has been handled by several people who could have shared that mitochondrial DNA profile." [...] Two of Eddowes's descendants {{are known to have}} been in the same room as the shawl for three days in 2007, and, {{in the words of one}} critic, [...] "The shawl has been openly handled by loads of people and been touched, breathed on, spat upon."

30|$|Information system {{organization}} measures <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> {{information on}} <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business {{organization and the}} information system. The organizational aspect is of great importance in the innovation process. Very frequently in spin-offs, an organization is informal and tends to replicate that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>teams.</b> However, if an informal organization {{can be useful in}} <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> <b>the</b> same may not occur inside an innovative company.

2500|$|Regional media {{immediately}} {{picked up}} the lawsuit, and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> were shocked {{when they found out}} about it. All of the scientists named in the suit were adamant that they never coerced Genie, maintaining that Genie's mother and her lawyers grossly exaggerated the length and nature of their testing, and denied any breach of confidentiality. While David Rigler was giving his deposition he discovered that Jean Butler Ruch had goaded Genie's mother into suing, and in an interview several years later the lawyers who worked with Genie's mother confirmed Ruch heavily influenced the actions of Genie's mother throughout the course of the lawsuit. According to author Russ Rymer, the suit was settled in 1984. However, in 1993 David Rigler wrote, [...] "he case never came to trial. It was dismissed by the Superior Court of the State of California 'with prejudice,' meaning that because it was without substance it can never again be refiled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lisp deeply {{influenced}} Alan Kay, {{the leader}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>team</b> that developed Smalltalk at Xerox PARC; {{and in turn}} Lisp was influenced by Smalltalk, with later dialects adopting object-oriented programming features (inheritance classes, encapsulating instances, message passing, etc.) in the 1970s. [...] The Flavors object system introduced the concept of multiple inheritance and the mixin. The Common Lisp Object System provides multiple inheritance, multimethods with multiple dispatch, and first-class generic functions, yielding a flexible and powerful form of dynamic dispatch. It {{has served as the}} template for many subsequent Lisp (including Scheme) object systems, which are often implemented via a metaobject protocol, a reflective metacircular design in which the object system is defined in terms of itself: Lisp was only the second language after Smalltalk (and {{is still one of the}} very few languages) to possess such a metaobject system. Many years later, Alan Kay suggested that as a result of the confluence of these features, only Smalltalk and Lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object-oriented programming systems.|$|E
