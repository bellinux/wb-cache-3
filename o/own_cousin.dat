5|$|Edmund, Earl of Kent (1301 to 1330). Edmund's {{loyalty to}} his half-brother, Edward II, {{resulted}} in his execution {{by order of}} the rebel Mortimer and his lover, Edward's queen, Isabella. His daughter, Joan, inherited his estates and married her <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> Edward the Black Prince; together, they had Richard, who later became the English king.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's {{coronation}} {{was celebrated}} on 23 August 1389 with a lavish ceremonial entry into Paris. Her second cousin and sister-in-law Valentina Visconti, who had married her <b>own</b> <b>cousin</b> Louis of Orléans (Charles' younger brother) {{two years earlier}} by proxy and papal dispensation, arrived in style, escorted across the Alps from Milan by 1,300 knights carrying personal luxuries such as books and a harp. The noblewomen in the coronation procession were dressed in lavish costumes with thread-of-gold embroidery, and rode in litters escorted by knights. Philip the Bold wore a doublet embroidered with 40 sheep and 40 swans, each decorated with a bell made of pearls.|$|E
25|$|In 1621, {{a wealthy}} man named Alessandro Marchetto of Udine {{submitted}} a memorandum to the Holy Office accusing both a fourteen-year-old boy and a local shepherd named Giovanni of being a benandanti, each of whom he had previously tried to employ to cure his <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> whom it was believed had been bewitched by sorcery.|$|E

25|$|In Arngrímur and the Chronicon Lethrense, Heoroweard is the {{son-in-law}} of Adils, {{married to}} his daughter Skuld, whereas Hrólf Kraki's saga makes him the son-in-law of Helgi (according to Olrik, {{he could not be}} {{married to his}} <b>own</b> <b>cousin).</b> The account shows that Heoroweard had close connection with Adils and Olrik suggests that the real reason behind Hrólfs voyage to Uppsala was Adils' support of Heoroweard.|$|E
25|$|Semmelweis' {{advice on}} {{chlorine}} washings was probably more influential than he realized. Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared {{quite willing to}} experiment with the practical hand washing measures that he proposed, but virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking theoretical innovation— that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. Professor Gustav Adolf Michaelis from a maternity institution in Kiel replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions— eventually he committed suicide, however, because he felt {{responsible for the death}} of his <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> whom he had examined after she gave birth.|$|E
25|$|The jazz pianist Laurent LeClaire {{returns to}} New Orleans from World War II and runs into {{his old friend}} Camille Raquin who is a frail man with an overprotective mother. Camille is married to his <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> Therese. Laurent {{falls in love with}} Therese, they become lovers, and conspire to kill her husband. Laurent murders Camille, who is pushed over the side of a rowboat. The news of his death sends Camille's {{mourning}} mother into a crippling stroke. After waiting a year, Laurent marries his friend's widow, but every time he tries to touch her, the ghost of Camille appears and drives them apart. In time, Therese is driven into madness and suicide, and Laurent kills himself.|$|E

25|$|Radu VII Paisie, {{also known}} as Radu vodă Măjescul, Radu vodă Călugărul, Petru I, and Petru de la Argeș (ca. 1500 – ?), was Prince of Wallachia almost {{continuously}} from June 1535 to February 1545. A man of uncertain origins, he depicted himself as an heir to the House of Basarab and the Drăculești, the son of Prince Radu the Great and half-brother of Vlad Vintilă and Radu of Afumați. The scholar Nicolaus Olahus partly supported this account, and further claimed that Paisie was his <b>own</b> <b>cousin.</b> The descent is accepted by other historians, whereas others suggest that Paisie was a regular member of the boyar class, or even a fishmonger. He {{is known to have}} been a monk of the Wallachian Orthodox Church before his coronation.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} {{put him at}} {{odds with}} the country's new democratic government led by Nazim al-Kudsi, and he was a political outcast during those years from 1961 to 1963, when a new coup in March of that year brought to power a more nationalist and unionist wing of the Baath. Jamal's <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> the future president Nureddin al-Atassi became Minister of the Interior, and Jamal became Minister of Information in the cabinet of Prime Minister Salah al-Din al-Bitar, {{one of the founders of}} the Baath party. He was also voted into the party's Revolutionary Command Council. A mere four months later Atassi resigned after coming to the realization that restoration of the UAR was not a party priority. He then formed his own party, the Arab Socialist Union, an umbrella group of dedicated unionists who wanted to restore the UAR and reappoint Nasser as president of Syria.|$|E
25|$|Though his {{paternal}} {{uncle was}} until 1909 the legitimist claimant {{to the throne}} of Spain, succeeded by prince Xavier’s <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> prince Xavier – a Frenchman at heart – himself did not reveal any particular interest in Spanish issues, even though he maintained close links with his cousin, in the 1920s resident in Paris. This changed when Jaime III died unexpectedly in 1931 and was succeeded in his Carlist claim by Alfonso Carlos I. Resident in Vienna, octogenarian and childless, Alfonso Carlos was doubly related to the Bourbon-Parmas; the two families remained on close terms. His ascendance to the Carlist claim was from the onset plagued by the succession problem, as it was already evident that the Carlist dynasty would extinguish. As measure to address the issue, in the early 1930s Alfonso Carlos pondered upon reconciliation with the Alfonsine branch. It {{is not clear whether}} he commenced talks {{with other members of the}} family about a strictly Carlist succession in parallel, as option B, or whether he embarked on this course having abandoned the plans of dynastic agreement in 1934-1935.|$|E

Simultaneously, al-Othman's father tried to prevent her from publishing, but when he died shortly after her marriage her name appeared in many newspapers and publications. She began writing for a daily column in the Al-Siyasah newspaper.|$|R

25|$|Spencer, {{along with}} the {{successive}} Chief Secretaries, Chichester Fortescue and Spencer's <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> Lord Hartington, supported coercive legislation {{to deal with the}} increase in agrarian crime, {{but at the same time}} supported a policy of releasing Fenian prisoners when possible. Spencer also had to deal during his tenure with Gladstone's Irish Universities Bill. In spite of Spencer's efforts to secure the support of the Catholic hierarchy for the bill, they opposed it, and it went down to defeat in the commons in March 1873. The government lingered on for a further year, until the election defeat of February 1874, when Spencer found himself out of office. When Gladstone returned to power for his second government in 1880, Spencer joined the Cabinet as Lord President of the Council, having responsibility for education policy, and was partially responsible for several major educational reforms of the period. The increasingly tense situation in Ireland, however, commanded an increasing portion of Spencer's time. In May 1882, Gladstone's decision to release the Irish Nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell from prison led to the resignation of the hardline Chief Secretary for Ireland, W. E. Forster. As a result, Spencer, while retaining his seat in the cabinet and position as Lord President, was again appointed Lord Lieutenant to take charge of the government's Irish policy.|$|E

500|$|Once Johnson's {{financial}} situation had become secure, {{he began to}} publish literary authors, most famously the poet William Cowper. Johnson issued Cowper's Poems (1782) and The Task (1784) at his own expense (a generous action {{at a time when}} authors were often forced to take on the risk of publication), and was rewarded with handsome sales of both volumes. Johnson published many of Cowper's works, including the anonymous satire Anti-thelyphora (1780), which mocked the work of Cowper's <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> the Rev. Martin Madan, who had advocated polygamy as a solution for prostitution. Johnson even edited and critiqued Cowper's poetry in manuscript, [...] "much to the advantage of the poems" [...] according to Cowper. In 1791, Johnson published Cowper's translations of the Homeric epics (extensively edited and corrected by Fuseli) and three years after Cowper's death in 1800, Johnson published a biography of the poet by William Hayley.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, Sorotzkin married Rochel Bloch, {{daughter}} of the Telzer Rav and Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch.

There, they joined his wife's uncles (and his <b>own</b> <b>cousins)</b> Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz who had re-established the Telz Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|R

5000|$|In most South-Sudanese cattle cultures, the bride-wealth system, {{and illegal}} taxing by some unscrupulous local leaders stimulates {{young men to}} find excuses to steal cows from their <b>own</b> <b>cousins.</b> Local leaders then {{sometimes}} try to quell or prevent intra-tribal fighting, by directing that aggression outward, to other tribes. Also, Murle are feared and seen by surrounding larger tribes as having strong magical powers, and therefore they are often blamed for outbreak of diseases, theft and arson.|$|R
500|$|The {{exact nature}} of Arbuthnot's {{relationship}} with Wellington {{has always been a}} subject for conjecture. Fuel was added to the speculations when Wellington was immediately pursued by female admirers following her death. One was a Miss Jenkins who, from the moment of Arbuthnot's death, pursued him [...] "body and soul." [...] Another, who resurfaced from his past, was Arbuthnot's <b>own</b> <b>cousin,</b> the eccentric Lady Georgiana Fane, who constantly pestered Wellington with threats to publish intimate letters he had once sent her, and to sue him for, allegedly, reneging on a promise to marry her. It seems most likely that in addition to assisting Wellington with his social life, Harriet's presence at his side protected him from the advances of other women. The Duke certainly kept mistresses during the period he knew Arbuthnot, but it has never been proven that Harriet was one of them. [...] The tour at Apsley House, the Duke's London residence, asserts that she merely served as his hostess at political dinners.|$|E

60|$|MEANWHILE, Prince Prigio had {{to suffer}} many {{unpleasant}} things. Though {{he was the}} crown prince (and though his arguments were unanswerable), everybody shunned him for a coward. The queen, who {{did not believe in}} Firedrakes, alone took his side. He was not only avoided by all, but he had most disagreeable scenes with his <b>own</b> <b>cousins,</b> Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena. In the garden Lady Molinda met him walking alone, and did not bow to him.|$|R
50|$|Swanson {{is married}} to Shana Madoff, {{who worked at the}} firm of her uncle Bernard Madoff as a rules and {{compliance}} officer and attorney until it was closed when the multibillion-dollar Madoff investment scandal was uncovered.
