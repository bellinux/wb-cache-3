For example, a copper foil or <b>screen</b> RF <b>shield</b> will be minimally effective against power frequency magnetic fields. A power frequency magnetic shield could offer little reduction of radio frequency fields. The {{same is true for}} different RF frequencies.

40|$|A balloon-borne {{experiment}} has {{measured the}} absolute {{temperature of the}} cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) at 10. 7 GHz to be Tcmbr = 2. 730 +-. 014 K. The error is the quadratic sum of several systematic errors, with statistical error of less than 0. 1 mK. The instrument comprises a cooled corrugated horn antenna coupled to a total-power radiometer. A cryogenic mechanical waveguide switch alternately connects the radiometer to the horn and to an internal reference load. The small measured temperature difference (<= 20 mK) between the sky signal and the reference load in conjunction {{with the use of a}} cold front end keeps systematic instrumental corrections small. Atmospheric and window emission are minimized by flying the instrument at 24 km altitude. A large <b>outer</b> ground <b>screen</b> and smaller inner <b>screen</b> <b>shield</b> the instrument from stray radiation from the ground and the balloon. In-flight tests constrain the magnitude of ground radiation contamination, and low level interference is monitored through observations in several narrow frequency bands.

50|$|The {{ships of}} the <b>outer</b> <b>screen</b> are {{intended}} to detect and engage any enemy units that have bypassed the pickets. These ships must be multi-role, but there is usually an emphasis on ASW, especially passive detection. It is quieter out there than near the HVUs and so detection is easier. Preferably there are helicopter ASW assets for 'stand off' engagement. The ASW ships are usually assigned to specific sectors which allows a 'sprint and drift' detection of submarines - the ship 'sprints' to {{the front edge of}} its sector, then slowly moves back across the sector. Passive towed sonar arrays operate very efficiently on the return leg. AAW ships in the <b>outer</b> <b>screen</b> operate to protect ASW operations and to attack enemy aircraft before they reach their weapons-launching points, so range of defensive weapon is more important than rate of fire here.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to focus, on one side, on the {{importance}} of visual culture and, on the other side, on the experience of perceptive travel seminars as powerful means to broaden multicultural awareness within higher education for intercultural dialogue and multiculturalism. In my PhD research I developed the concept of inner <b>screen</b> and <b>outer</b> <b>screen</b> (Soares, 2003), within a model of perception between images projected on (<b>outer)</b> <b>screens</b> and images projected in the mind (inner screens). As an essence within this dynamic model we can find universal images, those that C. G. Jung called archetypes. The first part of this paper aims at focusing on the relationship between visual culture (<b>outer</b> <b>screen)</b> and the inner perception of archetypes (universal images) that individuals of all cultures do share. As the essence of growing into multiculturalism consists in identifying which same roots humanity shares, those deep roots that are beyond the diversities of superficial appearance. The study of comparative mythology (C. G. Jung, Joseph Campbell), for example, reveals those analogies that exist among cultures coloured with local specificities and rituals. The aim is therefore the search for the global within the local as a starting point towards intercultural dialogue. In the second part of this paper we will focus our attention on perceptive travel seminars as innovative means of education in movement towards a gain of multicultural awareness. Traditionally higher education is centred indoors at the university. A means to develop intercultural dialogue is connected to a motivation towards getting to know other cultures, and that motivation can be conducted through perceptive travel seminars to be included into higher education in a regular basis...|$|R

5000|$|In {{professional}} student laboratory kits, {{the container}} A is {{often in the}} form of two concentric cylinders of metal screen, open at the top. [...] A screen acts the same as a solid metal sheet for electrostatic charge, as long as its holes are small. The inner cylinder is the Faraday pail container itself, separated from the outer cylinder with insulating supports. The <b>outer</b> cylindrical metal <b>screen</b> surrounds the inner, and acts as a ground to shield it from stray charges. This design largely eliminates the stray charge problem, as well as allowing the experimenter to see inside the container. The electrometer ground lead is clipped to the <b>outer</b> ground <b>screen,</b> and the experimenter touches this screen while performing any procedure. To ground the inner screen, the experimenter can bridge his finger between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>screens.</b> When doing this it is important that he lift his finger first from the inner <b>screen,</b> not the <b>outer,</b> to avoid leaving charge on the inner screen.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work the methods for {{producing}} flat and three dimensional <b>shielding</b> <b>screens</b> from the perforated steel tape are proposed. The possible application variants of mentioned screens are offered and analyzed. Main attention is given for producing one-layer and multi-layer screens with cellular structure {{due to its}} relatively low weight and technological elasticity-complex three-dimensional structures could be done successfully. Examples of produced <b>shielding</b> <b>screens</b> from perforated steel tape for protection from electromagnetic fields in different frequency range are offered and tested. The efficiency of a shielding material was determined by measuring the magnetic field before and after applying the shielding material. Distribution of the magnetic field behind the <b>shielding</b> <b>screen</b> was determined by software vector mapping. Shielding efficiency was measured for 1) a three layer perforated steel screen; 2) an one-layer perforated steel <b>screen</b> - <b>shielding</b> <b>screen</b> was placed in between the magnetic field source and the measurement point forming two dimensional screen; 3) copper composite sprayed screen. During experimental investigation it was established, that a three-layer perforated steel screen application allowed the 27 % reduction in the magnetic field, while one-layer perforated steel screen gave only 12 % reduction. Copper composite sprayed screen reduced magnetic field by 15 %. Recommendations for producing the multi-layer perforated steel <b>screen</b> accordingly to <b>shielding</b> efficiency are elaborated and laid down. The discussed material carries also ecological significance, since the material is produced by waste products (after stumping etc.). Therefore the production of such materials comes with reduced cost both in light of capital expenditures and ecological footprint...|$|R

Detection is strictly passive as the distance is still great enough for the HVUs to be safe.

Ship-mounted ASW weapons such as ASROC are reserved for when a contact is too close—generally less effective, their role is to distract the submarine from attacking and buy time for a more effective strike. In modern combat depth charges are never used; they are ineffective and have been completely replaced by guided torpedoes.|$|R
