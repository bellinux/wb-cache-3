500|$|Pierce {{voted the}} party line on most issues. He was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the Great Triumvirate of Calhoun, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster, who {{dominated}} the Senate. Pierce entered the Senate {{at a time of}} economic crisis, as the Panic of 1837 had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst [...] "the extravagance of <b>overtrading</b> and the wilderness of speculation". So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president Martin Van Buren and his plan to create an independent treasury, a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation. Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E

This study, based on the findings of Willows (2012), is a literature-based dissertation that investigates gender differences among mutual fund investors and mutual fund managers, as well as the gender differences in mutual fund investors in both developed markets and emerging markets. This dissertation found no significant difference in fund performance based on the manager's or the investor's gender based on market context. However, research is currently very limited in terms of investor behaviour along gender lines in an emerging market such as South African.

Production is active; industry grows, and grows with astonishing vigour and rapidity.

60|$|It {{has been}} {{sometimes}} said, that the losses at present sustained by farmers are merely {{the natural and}} necessary consequences of <b>overtrading,</b> and that they must bear them as all other merchants do, who have entered into unsuccessful speculations. But surely the question is not, or at least ought not to be, about the losses and profits of farmers, and the present condition of landholders compared with the past. It may be necessary, perhaps, to make inquiries of this kind, {{with a view to}} ulterior objects; but the real question respects the great loss of national wealth, attributed to a change in the spirit of our legislative enactments relating to the admission of foreign corn.|$|E
60|$|First {{among them}} is the waste of capital in periods of <b>overtrading</b> and rash speculation, and in the {{commercial}} revulsions by which such times are always followed. Mines are opened, railways or bridges made, and many other works of uncertain profit commenced, and in these enterprises much capital is sunk which yields either no return, or none adequate to the outlay. Factories are built and machinery erected beyond what the market requires, or can keep in employment. Even if they are kept in employment, the capital is no less sunk; it has been converted from circulating into fixed capital, and has ceased to have any influence on wages or profits. Besides this, there is a great unproductive consumption of capital during the stagnation which follows a period of general <b>overtrading.</b> Establishments are shut up, or kept working without any profit. Such are the effects of a commercial revulsion; and that such revulsions are almost periodical is a consequence of the very tendency of profits which we are considering. By the time a few years have passed over without a crisis, so much additional capital has been accumulated that it is no longer possible to invest it at the accustomed profit; all public securities rise to a high price, the rate of interest on the best mercantile security falls very low, and the complaint is general among persons in business that no money is to be made. But the diminished scale of all safe gains inclines persons to give a ready ear to any projects which hold out, though at the risk of loss, the hope of a higher rate of profit; and speculations ensue, which, with the subsequent revulsions, destroy, or transfer to foreigners, a considerable amount of capital, produce a temporary rise of interest and profit, make room for fresh accumulations, and the same round is recommenced.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a stylized}} fact of {{international}} finance that foreign equities are underweighted (the home bias) but <b>overtraded</b> (the high turnover). Since stylized facts drive research, theoretical models are now developed {{to explain the}} puzzling coexistence of home bias and high turnover, first presented in Tesar and Werner (1995), and researchers now dismiss transaction costs as a plausible explanation of home bias. I show, however, {{that part of the}} puzzle [...] very high turnover rates on foreign equity portfolios [...] is based on inaccurate estimates of cross-border holdings. Revised estimates of holdings of foreign equities from comprehensive benchmark surveys produce foreign turnover rates that are much lower than previously reported and are comparable to domestic turnover rates. The implications of this finding are clear. First, researchers should no longer develop theoretical models to explain the coexistence of home bias and high turnover. Second, the relationship between transaction costs and home bias should be reexplored. On the second point, the basic intuition from Tesar and Werner (1995) [...] that transaction costs do not help explain the observed home bias [...] is confirmed using actual data on transaction costs in 41 markets.

60|$|Let it {{be remembered}} that aged poverty {{is not the only}} evil with which, so far as our means allow, we have to grapple. What is the problem of the hour? It can be {{comprised}} in one word--Unemployment. After two years of unexampled trade expansion, we have entered upon a period of decline. We are not alone in this. A reaction from <b>overtrading</b> is general all over the world. Both Germany and the United States are suffering from a similar commercial contraction, and in both countries, in spite of their high and elaborate protective tariffs, a trade set-back has been accompanied by severe industrial dislocation and unemployment. In the United States of America, particularly, I am informed that unemployment has recently been more general than in this country. Indeed the financial collapse in the United States last autumn has been the most clearly marked of all the causes to which the present trade depression may be assigned.|$|E
60|$|The same {{disturbance}} of the exchanges and {{of international trade}} which is produced by an increased issue of convertible bank-notes is in like manner produced by those extensions of credit which, as was so fully shown in a preceding chapter, {{have the same effect}} on prices as an increase of the currency. Whenever circumstances have given such an impulse to the spirit of speculation as to occasion a great increase of purchases on credit, money prices rise, just as much as they would have risen if each person who so buys on credit had bought with money. All the effects, therefore, must be similar. As a consequence of high prices, exportation is checked and importation stimulated; though in fact the increase of importation seldom waits for the rise of prices which is the consequence of speculation, inasmuch as some of the great articles of import are usually among the things in which speculative <b>overtrading</b> first shows itself. There is, therefore, in such periods, usually a great excess of imports over exports; and, when the time comes at which these must be paid for, the exchanges become unfavorable and gold flows out of the country. This efflux of gold takes effect on prices [by withdrawing gold from the reserves of the banks, and so by stopping loans and the use of credit, or purchasing power]: its effect is to make them recoil downward. The recoil once begun, generally becomes a total rout, and the unusual extension of credit is rapidly exchanged for an unusual contraction of it. Accordingly, when credit has been imprudently stretched, and the speculative spirit carried to excess, the turn of the exchanges and consequent pressure on the banks to obtain gold for exportation are generally the proximate cause of the catastrophe.|$|E

40|$|Growth is {{considered}} the hallmark of success for any entrepreneurial business. Therefore, entrepreneurs are highly growth inclined individuals. Entrepreneurs regard especially rapid growth as important to create wealth for themselves and society, {{as well as to}} grow the economy as quickly as possible. Although growth can be an entrepreneurial business’ biggest ally, it can also become an entrepreneurial business’ worst enemy. Many entrepreneurial businesses have fallen because of rapid growth, especially if the growth was unforeseen and unprepared for. Business decline and business failure due to rapid growth is known as <b>overtrading.</b> This paper aims at exploring this phenomenon, so that a higher level of knowledge regarding its symptoms, potential dangers and impact on the entrepreneurial businesses can be obtained. This research is important to entrepreneurs to enable them to diagnose <b>overtrading,</b> and realise the impact and effect it might have on their businesses. This paper examines the following propositions: • Proposition One: <b>Overtrading</b> always results in entrepreneurial business failure; • Proposition Two: <b>Overtrading</b> only occurs in new (entrepreneurial) businesses; • Proposition Three: <b>Overtrading</b> can be understood as a core evaluation criterion for entrepreneurial business failure. These propositions are examined because there is very little research on this topic despite the fact that <b>overtrading</b> is widely recognised as at least a contributing factor to business decline and failure. The possible outcomes of the study are that sufficient support can be found that <b>overtrading</b> is a definite cause for entrepreneurial business failure and that especially new entrepreneurial businesses should guard against <b>overtrading,</b> since they {{are the ones that are}} in the start-up phase. Therefore, <b>overtrading</b> can be cited as a core evaluation criterion for entrepreneurial business failure.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Several mixed {{industry}} prediction models about failure {{have been}} reasonably successful in differentiating between successful companies {{and those that}} have failed. The challenge, however, is to venture into the grey area in between and to identify companies, which are financially unstable, at an early stage. Early identification enables management to intervene timeously {{in an attempt to}} prevent failure. Failure is defined as either liquidation, delisting, suspension of listing or a substantial change in structure. The grey area focused on in this study is <b>overtrading.</b> <b>Overtrading</b> is triggered by the company growing at too high a rate relative to its specific structure. Cash is necessary to fund expansion, whether for an increase in inventories, credit sales or new non-current assets. If the company does not generate enough cash to fund this expansion, it has to be financed through external sources. The longer the period of growth and the higher the growth rate, the more the cash requirements. From the theoretical model underlying <b>overtrading,</b> it was found that: • the higher the growth in sales, • the smaller the profit margin, and • the higher the net current assets in proportion to total assets, the lower the cash flow from operating activities before dividends were paid (CFO). Any company ought to generate enough cash from its daily activities {{in order to maintain the}} existing level of business, to repay loans, to replace assets and to pay dividends. If the internal generation of cash is insufficient to finance these activities, existing cash resources will be consumed, unproductive non-current assets will be sold and possibly also some of the productive non-current assets. The outcome for such a company is a business combination or liquidation. Due to the fact that cash plays such a big role in failure, cash flow variables constitute the majority of the independent variables used in the development of the failure prediction models. The <b>overtrading</b> ratio was developed as a measurement tool to quantify <b>overtrading.</b> As long as the company generates a positive CFO, it is not so much at risk as a company that does not succeed in generating a positive CFO. Therefore, a negative CFO for a three-year period was decided on as the norm for identifying possible financial difficulty. A company is involved in <b>overtrading</b> if the sum of CFO for three years less the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years, divided by the absolute value of the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years equals - 1 or smaller in the case of a company with a cumulative profit for the three years; and smaller than nought in the case of a company with a cumulative loss for the three years. South African industrial companies listed for at least three years during the period 1974 to 2003, were identified. From a total of 6 662 cumulative three-year periods, 944 <b>overtrading</b> years were identified. Failure occurred in 212 out of 526 companies involved in <b>overtrading</b> between January 1974 and August 1989. 120 out of 199 companies involved in <b>overtrading</b> between September 1989 and November 1995 failed, while 90 out of 127 companies involved in <b>overtrading,</b> failed between December 1995 and June 2000. By June 2005 it was already evident that 49 out of 92 companies involved in <b>overtrading</b> between July 2000 and December 2003, had already failed. Companies involved in <b>overtrading,</b> may survive artificially for lengthy periods with the support of providers of capital. It can therefore be expected that failure prediction models will not achieve a better accuracy rate than achieved by probabilities. Six failure prediction models utilising classification tree algorithms were developed. Using data from two periods, two different models were developed; one for growth and recession phases of the economy, the other without distinction between economic phases. The first period was September 1989 to June 2000, the other December 1995 to June 2000. June 2000 was chosen as the cut-off, since a period of five years after an <b>overtrading</b> year was necessary to follow-up whether the company had failed. Each universe was split in two – the learning sample, more or less 60 %, and the test sample, more or less 40 %. The models were developed from the learning sample and the test sample was used as substantiation of the results of the developed model. The total classification accuracy of the three best models, one for the growth-phase, one for the recession-phase and one mixed economy model, is respectively 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % and 80, 26 % and the classification accuracy for the failed companies 75, 29 %, 100 % and 85, 19 % respectively. The total prediction accuracy of the three models is respectively 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % and 72, 55 %, and that of the failed companies 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % and 83, 33 %. The accuracy of all the models was found to be higher than what the accuracy would have been if all the companies involved in <b>overtrading</b> were merely classified as having failed. From the results of the different tests, it seems that Ver 3, the growth in sales from year 1 to year 3, is probably the most important independent variable in the classification between failed and non-failed <b>overtrading</b> years. This corroborates the theory underlying <b>overtrading</b> that indicates that a high sales growth puts a company at risk for cash flow problems. Companies where the cash flow problems develop because of an increase in current assets will be intercepted by the <b>overtrading</b> ratio. Companies where cash flow problems develop due to replacement of non-current assets, will not necessarily be intercepted by the <b>overtrading</b> ratio as CFO that is used in the <b>overtrading</b> ratio does not allow for replacement of non-current assets. It is therefore necessary to adjust CFO to a free cash flow CFO. Depreciation is used as an alternative for replacement investment since disclosure of replacement investment is not required. Depreciation is theoretically the fraction of the value of an asset lost during the year; this value needs to be replaced. By subtracting the depreciation for the year from CFO, this amount will be more representative of the cash position of the company after considering all the normal transactions in order to sustain the business. After all the adjustments for a free cash flow, six models were developed for the different periods and economic phases. The accuracy of these models were better than what the accuracy would have been if <b>overtrading</b> years were merely classified as failed. Implementing these models would therefore improve specificity. From the tests performed, Ver 3 and KVB 3 /TB (the cumulative CFO for the three years over total assets) seem to be the most important independent variables in the classification between failed and non-failed when considering free cash flow. This is informative as KVB 3 :TB represents a fictional amount, as if the company spent an amount equal to depreciation on replacement investment. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Heelwat gemengde industrie-mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle was al redelik suksesvol in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en suksesvolle maatskappye. Die uitdaging is egter om die grys area tussen dié uiterstes te betree en ’n maatskappy wat finansieel onstabiel is, vroegtydig te identifiseer. Vroegtydige identifikasie stel die bestuur in staat om betyds in te gryp en mislukking te voorkom. Mislukking word as likwidasie, òf denotering, òf opskorting van notering, òf ’n wesenlike struktuurverandering, gedefinieer. Die grys area waarop die fokus in hierdie studie val, is oorbedryf. Oorbedryf word veroorsaak deurdat die maatskappy teen ’n te hoë koers relatief tot sy spesifieke struktuur groei. Kontant is nodig om uitbreiding, hetsy ’n toename in voorraad, kredietverkope of nuwe nie-bedryfsbates, te finansier. Indien die besigheid nie genoeg kontant genereer om hierdie uitbreiding te finansier nie, moet dit vanuit eksterne bronne gefinansier word. Hoe langer die tydperk van groei voortduur en hoe hoër die groeikoers is, hoe meer is die kontantbehoeftes. Uit die teoretiese model wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, is bevind dat: • hoe hoër die groei in verkope, • hoe kleiner die winspersentasie, en • hoe hoër die bedryfskapitaal in verhouding tot die totale bates; hoe laer is die kontantvloei uit bedryfsaktiwiteite voor dividende betaal (KVB). Enige besigheid behoort genoeg kontant uit dag-tot-dag-aktiwiteite te genereer ten einde die bestaande vlak van besigheid vol te hou, lenings terug te betaal, bates te vervang en dividende te betaal. Indien die interne kontantgenerering onvoldoende is om hierdie aktiwiteite te finansier, sal bestaande kontantbronne uitgewis word, onproduktiewe nie-bedryfsbates sal verkoop word en moontlik ook van die produktiewe nie-bedryfsbates. Die uiteinde vir so ’n maatskappy is ’n besigheidsoorname of ’n likwidasie. Aangesien kontantvloei so ’n groot rol in mislukking speel, is kontantvloeiveranderlikes die meerderheid van die onafhanklike veranderlikes wat in die ontwikkeling van die mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle gebruik is. Die oorbedryfsratio is as ’n maatstaf ontwikkel om oorbedryf te meet. Solank as wat ’n maatskappy ’n positiewe KVB genereer, is hy nie so riskant soos ’n maatskappy wat nie daarin kan slaag om positiewe kontant te genereer nie. Daarom is ’n negatiewe kumulatiewe KVB vir ’n drie-jaar-tydperk as die norm gestel om moontlike finansiële nood te identifiseer. ’n Maatskappy is besig met oorbedryf indien die som van die KVB vir drie jaar minus die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gedeel deur die absolute waarde van die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gelyk aan of kleiner as - 1 is, in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe wins vir die drie jaar het; en kleiner as nul in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe verlies vir die drie jaar het. Alle Suid-Afrikaanse genoteerde industriële maatskappye wat vir ten minste drie jaar gedurende die tydperk 1974 tot 2003 genoteer was, is geïdentifiseer. Uit ’n totaal van 6 662 kumulatiewe drie-jaar-tydperke was daar 944 oorbedryfsjare. Vanaf Januarie 1974 tot Augustus 1989 was daar 526 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 212 misluk het. Vanaf September 1989 tot November 1995 was daar 199 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 120 misluk het en vanaf Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000 het 90 van 127 oorbedryfsjare misluk. Teen Junie 2005 was dit reeds bekend dat 49 van die 92 oorbedryfsjare tussen Julie 2000 en Desember 2003 misluk het. Oorbedryfsmaatskappye bly soms vir uitgebreide tydperke kunsmatig voortbestaan, indien die verskaffers van kapitaal hulle dra. Die verwagting was dus dat mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle nie ’n beter akkuraatheid sou behaal as wat waarskynlikhede sou bepaal nie. Ses mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle is met behulp van die klassifikasieboomalgoritme ontwikkel. Een model elk vir die groeifase en die resessie-fase van die ekonomie en een model sonder onderskeid van die ekonomiese fase is met die gebruikmaking van twee tydperke se data ontwikkel. Die eerste tydperk was September 1989 tot Junie 2000 en die ander Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000. Junie 2000 is as die afsnypunt gebruik aangesien ’n vyf-jaaropvolgtydperk na ’n oorbedryfsjaar nodig is om vas te stel of die maatskappy misluk het. Elke universum is in twee verdeel – die leersteekproef, ongeveer 60 %, en die toetssteekproef, ongeveer 40 %. Die modelle is uit die leersteekproef afgelei en die toetssteekproef is gebruik as bevestiging van die resultate van die afgeleide model. Die totale klassifikasie-akkuraatheid van die drie beste modelle, een vir die groeifase, een vir die resessie-fase en een gemengde ekonomiemodel, is onderskeidelik 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % en 80, 26 % en dié vir die mislukte maatskappye 75, 29 %, 100 % en 85, 19 %. Die totale voorspellingsakkuraatheid van die drie modelle is onderskeidelik 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % en 72, 55 % en dié van die mislukte maatskappye 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % en 83, 33 %. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is meer as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Uit die resultate van verskeie toetse blyk dit dat Ver 3, die groei in verkope vanaf jaar 1 tot jaar 3, waarskynlik die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlike in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en nie-mislukte oorbedryfsjare is. Dit ondersteun die teorie wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, wat aandui dat ’n hoë groei in verkope ’n maatskappy op risiko plaas vir kontantvloeiprobleme. Maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme vanweë ’n uitbreiding in bedryfskapitaal ontstaan, word deur die oorbedryfsratio onderskep. Die maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme eerder uit die vervanging van nie-bedryfsbates sal voortvloei, sal nie noodwendig deur die oorbedryfsratio ondervang word nie, aangesien die KVB wat in die oorbedryfsratio gebruik word, nie voorsiening maak vir vervangende investering nie. Dit is daarom nodig om KVB tot ’n vrye kontantvloei-KVB aan te pas. Waardevermindering word as ’n alternatief vir vervangende investering gebruik, aangesien vervangende investering nie ’n verpligte openbaarmakingsvereiste is nie. Waardevermindering is teoreties dié deel van die bate wat gedurende die jaar opgebruik is en wat vervang behoort te word. Deur dus die jaarlikse waardevermindering van KVB af te trek, is hierdie syfer meer verteenwoordigend van die maatskappy se kontantposisie nadat alle normale transaksies om die besigheid in stand te hou, in ag geneem is. Na die aanpassings vir vrye kontantvloei is weer ses modelle uit die verskillende tydperke en vir die verskillende ekonomiese fases ontwikkel. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is beter as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Ver 3 en KVB 3 :TB (die kumulatiewe KVB vir die drie jaar tot die totale bates) blyk uit die toetse die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlikes te wees in die onderskeid tussen misluk en nie-misluk wanneer vrye kontantvloei in ag geneem word. Dit is insiggewend aangesien KVB 3 :TB ’n fiktiewe syfer verteenwoordig, sou die maatskappy ’n bedrag wat gelyk is aan waardevermindering, aan vervangende investering bestee het...|$|E
40|$|MicroFinance Institutions (MFIs) {{have assumed}} {{prominence}} as important lending {{institutions in the}} economic development process of developing countries. However, in Ghana, 2013 witnessed unprecedented collapses of MFIs, {{in spite of the}} fact that they met the minimum requirement for licensing by the Bank of Ghana. This paper is a systematic literature review or conceptual article that examines the two perspectives: (1) <b>Overtrading</b> as cause of MFIs ‟ failures and (2) Lack of qualified staffs as cause of MFIs ‟ failures. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the relative merits of those two perspectives. This review appeared to support the view that both perspectives are contributory factors in causing MFIs ‟ collapse in Ghana. MFIs need to ensure that adequate working capital is available and reliable with the level of operations to deal with the problem of <b>overtrading.</b> MFIs must also pay attention to staff related problems, such as educational level, skills development, and appropriate staff incentive schemes. This review contributes to academic literature on MFI collapse. This review also offers policy prescriptions to managers of MFIs to improve upon their hiring and training practices in order to fulfill their role as invaluable lending institutions in the economic development process...|$|E
40|$|We model {{an anxious}} agent {{as one who}} is more risk averse for {{imminent}} than for distant risk. Such preferences can lead to dynamic inconsistencies with respect to risk trade-offs. We derive implications for financial markets such as a term structure in risk premia, as well as <b>overtrading</b> and price anomalies around announcement dates, which are found empirically. We show that strategies to cope with anxiety can explain costly delegation of investment decisions. Finally, we model how an anxiety-prone agent may endogenously become overconfident and take excessive risks...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by individuals' {{emotional}} response to risk at different time horizons, we model an 'anxious' agent - {{one who is}} more risk averse with respect to imminent risks than distant risks. Such preferences describe well-documented features of 1) individual behavior, 2) equilibrium prices, and 3) institutions. In particular, we derive implications for financial markets, such as <b>overtrading</b> and price anomalies around announcement dates, {{as well as a}} downward-sloping term structure of risk premia, which are found empirically. Since such preferences can lead to dynamic inconsistencies with respect to risk trade-offs, we show that costly delegation of investment decisions is a strategy used to cope with 'anxiety. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{find and}} {{describe}} four futures markets where the bid-ask spread is bid {{down to the}} fixed price tick size practically all the time, and which match counterparties using a pro-rata rule. These four markets' offered depths at the quotes on average exceed mean market order size by two orders of magnitude, and their order cancellation rates (the probability of any given offered lot being cancelled) are significantly over 96 per cent. We develop a simple theoretical model to ex- plain these facts, where strategic complementarities {{in the choice of}} limit order size cause traders to risk <b>overtrading</b> by submitting over-sized limit orders, most of which they expect to cancel...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behaviour}} of various popular risk portfolios measures used for portfolio construction are compared {{using data from}} the recent financial crisis. Results are revealing the way optimal portfolios should be constructed. Despite the conventional wisdom, short selling gives only a marginal improvement to portfolio performance during the crisis period. Optimal semivariance portfolio produces better results than the portfolio constructed with the more advanced expected short fall method. Additional historical information has added to performance up to a point and long dated history seems not to be commensurate with additional benefits. Rebalancing frequency seems to have an optimal point that favours neither <b>overtrading</b> nor the conventional buy and hold strategy...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses population-wide {{data from}} the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Consumer Finances to resolve the {{conflict}} between <b>overtrading</b> and inactivity shown in administrative data on brokerage and retirement accounts, respectively. Considerable inertia is found and linked to characteristics (e. g., limited education or resources), but less to index movements: the downswing has encouraged "staying" out, rather than "getting" out, of the market. The small minority with brokerage accounts exhibits important differences in trading patterns relative to the population and invests small fractions of wealth in brokerage accounts. Results strengthen the case for default options in retirement accounts and built-in trading provisions in mutual funds. Copyright (c) 2010 The Ohio State University. ...|$|E
40|$|As the evolvement of {{financial}} trading technology with wireless network infrastructure, mobile trading technology has emerged to meet investors ’ requirements {{to access the}} financial markets regardless of time and place. However, being like a “two-edged sword”, mobile trading technology may affect investors ’ irrational trading behaviors negatively. This research investigates both {{the positive and negative}} effect of mobile trading technology on investors ’ behaviors including rational disciplined trading and irrational <b>overtrading.</b> According to the nature of mobile trading technology, this study suggests mobile trading platform improves investors trading perceptions in terms of perceived efficiency and perceived informativeness. Then, the influence of mobile trading platform usage on investors ’ disciplined trading is examined. Meanwhile, from the perspectives of behavioral financ...|$|E
3000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} impact of overconfidence on risk assessment through the mediator of risk awareness, we furthermore assume that overconfidence might be linked directly to an overly positive {{assessment of risk}} occurrence probabilities and risk impacts. Overconfidence {{has been shown to}} lead to hazardous risk taking by <b>overtrading</b> stocks, decreasing portfolio performance compared to market performance (Barber and Odean 2001) and leading people to take additional risks (Van Zant and Moore 2013). Similarly, overconfidence leads CEOs to overpay for target companies and to undertake value-destroying mergers (Malmendier and Tate 2008). CEO’s overconfidence furthermore leads to increased risk taking by the firm (Li and Tang 2010). Because decision theory suggests that people assess risks before they engage in risky behavior (Glöckner and Betsch 2008), we predict that higher overconfidence leads to more positive risk assessments: [...]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This model simulates {{a simple}} {{exchange}} economy {{made up of}} geographically dispersed, rationally bounded agents with spatially correlated initial endowments who incur transactions costs {{in the process of}} trading. Agents are able to advertise globally at no cost in order to inform other agents of potential trading opportunities, but they must pay a transaction cost proportional to the distance traveled to visit an agent in order to engage in trade. Although trade is shown to improve the efficiency of the economy in most cases, a negative search externality occurs at low transaction resulting in <b>overtrading</b> and a loss of efficiency. The effect of trade on inequality depends on the measure of wealth. The presence of highly spatially correlated initial endowments is shown to diminish slightly the benefits of trade relative to the randomly allocated initial endowments case...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the factors which, {{in the absence}} of strong financial regulation, sustain the Iron Law of the Financial Markets asserting that speculative booms and busts occur more or less regularly from 17 century to the present. The first factor is that financial markets are self-fulfilling system. The second is that human nature does not change and is based on egoism, materialism, loss aversion, exaggerated hopes and fears, emulation, propensity to gamble, herd behavior and so on. Lastly, there is the extreme brevity of the financial memory. In order to enable economic authorities and/or individuals to detect timely that the unsustainable boom is under the way, we have identified the common features of historically recorded speculative episodes. Stages through which the system passes on its way from unsustainable rise to inevitable fall are: displacement, boom, <b>overtrading,</b> financial distress and discredit or revulsion...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that investors trade too frequently, and that this <b>overtrading</b> lowers {{investment}} return. This paper examines the characteristics of investors who trade frequently. Multivariable regression analysis of over three years of trading data from 7200 UK investors enabled identification of numerous characteristics significantly and positively associated with frequent trading. These were male gender, younger age, use of stop losses and use of multiple mediums of trading, including the internet, the telephone and an advice team. In addition, the research revealed that trading frequency is positively skewed, in that {{a small proportion of}} investors are responsible {{for the majority of the}} trading with the highest cumulative value. The results are of practical value to policy makers that want to reduce investors&# 039; trading frequency because they outline that a small minority of investors need be targeted...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new market-making model which {{incorporates}} {{a number of}} realistic features relevant for high-frequency trading. In particular, we model the dependency structure of prices and order arrivals with novel self- and cross-exciting point processes. Furthermore, instead of assuming the bid and ask prices can be adjusted continuously by the market maker, we formulate the market maker 2 ̆ 7 s decisions as an optimal switching problem. Moreover, the risk of <b>overtrading</b> has been taken into consideration by allowing each order to have different size, and the market maker can make use of market orders, which are treated as impulse control, {{to get rid of}} excessive inventory. Because of the stochastic intensities of the cross-exciting point processes, the optimality condition cannot be formulated using classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJBQVI), so we extend the framework of constrained forward backward stochastic differential equation (CFBSDE) to solve our optimal control problem...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{attempts}} to raise {{a significant percentage of}} gross domestic product in revenue from a broad-based financial transactions tax are likely to fail both by raising much less revenue than expected and by generating far-reaching changes in economic behavior. They point out that, although the side effects would include a sizable restructuring of financial sector activity, this would not occur in ways corrective of the particular forms of financial <b>overtrading</b> that were most conspicuous in contributing to the crisis. Accordingly, such taxes likely deliver both less revenue and less efficiency benefits than have sometimes been claimed by some. On the other hand, they may be less damaging than feared by others.
