For instance, though no formal {{studies have been}} conducted yet, it is generally acknowledged within the church that the rising number <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> work as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) places significant stress in the maintenance of relationships among members within families. Moreover, the growing number <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> labor as call center agents also adds to the difficulty in raising families, as call center agents often have to work in night schedules thereby decreasing the amount of time of being with their respective families.|$|E

25|$|In 1859 an {{additional}} school was opened {{to satisfy the}} needs <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> wanted a government controlled school.

In 1878 the school moved to the current site in Tyrrell Street. The success of this new public school led the state government to take control of the church school in 1883 and name it Newcastle East Public School.|$|E
25|$|Children {{of smoking}} parents {{are more likely}} to smoke than {{children}} with non-smoking parents. Children <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> smoke are less likely to quit smoking. One study found that parental smoking cessation was associated with less adolescent smoking, except when the other parent currently smoked. A current study tested the relation of adolescent smoking to rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home. Results showed that restrictive home smoking policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying smoking for both middle and high school students.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} sole purpose of Jamaica College from 1903 onwards was to train {{potential}} university students in the days when the University of the West Indies did not exist, in practice most students did not go further than fourth or fifth forms. That was considered sufficient education for just about any managerial or clerical job in Jamaica. It was also considered uneconomical to run a school of less than eighty boys, and therefore a deliberate attempt to expand the school to include those <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> were able to afford the fees was embarked upon. By the 1930s, the student population rose to over one hundred and fifty.|$|E

500|$|Parents {{and family}} members {{regularly}} travelled to the schools, often camping outside {{to be closer to}} their children. The number <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> made the trip prompted Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed to argue that industrial schools, like residential schools, be moved greater distances from reserves to make visiting more difficult. He also objected to allowing children to return home during school breaks and holidays because he believed the trips interrupted the civilizing of school attendees. As Reed explained in 1894, the problem with day schools was that students returned home each night where they were influenced by life on the reserve, whereas [...] "in the boarding or industrial schools the pupils are removed for a long period from the leadings of this uncivilized life and receive constant care and attention".|$|E

500|$|The opinion (written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite) {{first asked}} whether Minor was {{a citizen of}} the United States, and {{answered}} that she was, citing both the Fourteenth Amendment and earlier common law. [...] Exploring the common-law origins of citizenship, the court observed that [...] "new citizens may be born or they may be created by naturalization" [...] and that the Constitution [...] "does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens." [...] Under the common law, according to the court, [...] "it was never doubted that all children born in a country <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. [...] These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners." [...] The court observed that some authorities [...] "include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents"—but since Minor was born in the United States and her parents were U.S. citizens, she was unquestionably a citizen herself, even under the narrowest possible definition, and the court thus noted that the subject {{did not need to be}} explored in any greater depth.|$|E

500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
