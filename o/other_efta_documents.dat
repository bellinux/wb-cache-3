5000|$|Given the United Kingdom's {{referendum}} vote {{in favour}} of leaving the European Union and Scotland's overwhelming {{vote in favour}} of remaining within the European Union, the Scottish Government has looked into methods to retain access or membership within the EEA, and membership of the EFTA is another option the government is analysing.

5000|$|By referendums in 1972 and 1994, Norwegians {{rejected}} {{proposals to}} join the European Union (EU). However, Norway, together with Iceland and Liechtenstein, participates in the European Union's single market through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries- transposed into Norwegian law via [...] "EØS-loven"- describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> countries. Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the Schengen Agreement and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.|$|R
50|$|Switzerland {{was unable}} to sign the European Economic Area treaty, {{even though it had}} participated {{actively}} in drawing it up, owing to a negative vote in a Swiss referendum in November 1992. A bilateral agreement with the EU nevertheless allows Switzerland {{to take advantage of the}} main EU instruments in place, including the seven-year framework programmes for research and innovation, the Future and Emerging Technologies programme, the grants of the European Research Council and the Erasmus programme for student exchange,  in return for adhering to the 'four freedoms' of the single market, the freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital. Switzerland’s political ties to the EU are therefore more tenuous than those of the three <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> members.|$|R
5000|$|The 2007 Convention is {{substantially}} {{the same as}} the 2001 regulation: the main difference being that the word [...] "Regulation" [...] is replaced with the word [...] "Convention" [...] throughout the text and that the 2007 convention is not adapted to the recast of the Brussels regulation. It is also open to accession by <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> states as well as EU states acting on behalf of territories which {{are not part of the}} EU (e.g. the Isle of Man in the case of the UK). Other states may join subject to approval of the present parties to the treaty. No accessions have taken place so far, but the Kingdom of the Netherlands planned to present to parliament an approval act for accession on behalf of Aruba, Caribbean Netherlands, Curaçao and possibly Sint Maarten in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{proposals}} for enlarging the European Community {{to include the}} EFTA countries {{raise the question of}} whether the new members should participate in a European Monetary Union. In part, the issue hinges on the incidence of aggregate supply and demand disturbances. We use data on prices and output and a VAR decomposition to analyse this issue empirically, grouping economies according to the magnitude of the disturbances, their cross-country correlation, and speeds of response. We distinguish an EC `core' (Germany and its immediate neighbours) and an EC periphery (UK and the Southern European members of the Community). Austria, Sweden and Switzerland display more similarity to the EC core than do Finland, Iceland and Norway. This suggests that the case for EMU participation is stronger for Austria, Sweden and Switzerland than for the <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> countries. EC Enlargement; EFTA; EMU...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the European Free Trade Association and its gradual {{integration}} into the European Union. Both EFTA and the EU were founded in post-war Europe {{with the objective of}} economic prosperity through mutual cooperation of the Member States, this later resulted in mutual cooperation between the two units and the progressive incorporation of EFTA into the EU. The first chapter discusses the development context for EFTA and the EEA upto 2001. The second chapter analyzes the impact of the revision of the memorandum on the relationship between Switzerland and the <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> members, the level of cooperation achieved in the EEA, and Switzerland's current relationship with the EU. The third chapter outlines the possibilities of further development of EFTA and the EEA countries and summarizes the current attitudes of individual members of EFTA towards furtherdeepening of their mutual relations...|$|R

5000|$|A 2016 UK {{referendum}} {{voted to}} withdraw from the European Union. Staying in the EEA, possibly eventually as an EFTA member, is one of the suggested options. A 2013 research paper presented to the Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU's internal market, including continuing EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the Swiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the single market. [...] The United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member upon joining the European Union. In the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that they were open to a UK return and that Britain has many issues to work through [...] although the Norwegian Government later expressed reservations. [...] In January 2017, Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek continued permanent membership in the single market. The Scottish Government has looked into membership of EFTA to retain access to the EEA. [...] However, <b>other</b> <b>EFTA</b> states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible for membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The six {{countries}} of the EEC had decided on a customs union: they agreed to remove tariffs between one another within a period of twelve years, and to erect a common tariff barrier between themselves and other countries.Seven of the excluded European countries (England, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal) responded with an alternative free trade area, EFTA, which also removed tariff barriers between each other, but did not insist on a tariff barrier with <b>other</b> countries.The <b>EFTA</b> convention was signed in January 1960 and was to come into force in May 1960.On 3 March 1960, Hallstein announced a plan for accelerating {{the implementation of the}} common market, which commentators regarded as sabotaging hopes of a joint free trade area that included the EEC and EFTA.This invoked the displeasure, not only of the EFTA countries, but also of the Economics Ministry under Erhard. Commentators talked of Hallstein's [...] "religious zeal".|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} have special relations to the European Union implementing most of its regulations. Prominently there are Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein which are the only remaining EFTA members while all <b>other</b> former <b>EFTA</b> members have converted into EU members. Through agreements Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (not including Switzerland) {{are members of the}} European Economic Area since 1994. As a consequence of taking part in the EU single market they need to adopt part of the Law of the European Union. Formally they would not need to fund the EU government but in practice they have opted to take on their part of financing EU institutions as required by EU law (see EEA and Norway Grants) with the financial footprint of Norway being equal to that of an EU member since 2009. Especially Norway and Iceland are known to forfeit EU membership on the basis of EU fishery regulations that they want to opt out on. Both Norway and Iceland have signed and implemented the Schengen zone agreements. During the turmoils of the financial crisis Iceland was looking into membership of the Eurozone and it did formally apply to EU membership in 2009. Norway has joined all EU political treaties and it has applied to EU membership multiple times but while fulfilling the requirements the government was vetoed by public vote in their own country in 1972 and 1994. This leaves Norway to be integrated into Inner Europe's institutions while not being part their governing body.|$|R
40|$|This report aims at {{assessing}} {{whether the}} economic structure of Europe {{is becoming more}} knowledge-intensive, in comparison with <b>other</b> countries (EU, <b>EFTA</b> and non-European benchmarks US, Japan, China). This entails the measurement of key dimension of structural change with a simple policy tool. The present work builds on and updates {{the results of the}} previous Feasibility Study on the development of composite indicators of structural change (Vertesy et al., 2012). It also builds on a previous study by Malerba et al. (2011) that identified indicators measuring changes in the actual sectoral composition of the economy. In this study we construct a composite indicator on structural change at the country level, including indicators on R&D, skills, sectoral specialization, international specialization and internationalization. This composite is a supply-oriented indicator that is largely based on past performance (the outcomes of past efforts that are already measurable in terms of actual value added and employment levels in knowledge-based activities, revealed competitive advantages, supply of skilled human resources, etc.). All these indicators are related to the overall structure of the economy and are slow to change. In order to capture short-term characteristics of structural change related to the dynamics of smaller and younger firms, future research should focus on the development of a longitudinal database collecting indicators on the share of gazelles and the share of high-growth firms in terms of employment and turnover.

Pierre Sauve, Deputy Managing Director and Director of Studies, WTI and Co-leader, NCCR-Trade work programme on preferentialism and Anirudh Shingal, Senior Research Fellow, WTI and Co-leader, NCCR-Trade work programme on impact assessment of trade, co-authored a paper on the nature of preferentialism in services trade, which Anirudh presented at the workshop. The event was extremely well-attended by high profile dignitaries and academics including President Leuthard; Director General of the WTO, Pascal Lamy; trade ministers of Brazil and Finland; Jan Kubis, Executive Secretary of the UNECE and several current and former ambassadors. The academic workshop, moderated by Theresa Carpenter (Graduate Institute, Geneva), began in the morning with Prof. Victor Norman's (Norwegian School of Economics & Business Administration) presentation on the future of <b>EFTA.</b> <b>Other</b> presentations included those by Prof. Peter Egger (ETH Zurich) on the structural estimation of gravity models with market entry dynamics and by Prof. Richard Baldwin (Graduate Institute, Geneva) on 21 st century regionalism.

5000|$|In Case E-8/13, Abelia, the Court {{dismissed}} {{an action}} brought by Abelia, a trade and employers association {{that is part}} of Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon (“NHO”), the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The applicant sought the annulment of ESA Decision No 160/13/COL of 24 April 2013 where ESA concluded, without initiating the formal investigation procedure, that the contested provisions of the Norwegian VAT Act and VAT Compensation Act did not have the effect of granting State aid, within the meaning of Article 61(1) EEA, to public schools or the lessors of premises to public schools. Besides the applicant’s legal interest in bringing the action for annulment, which led to the dismissal, the Court {{had to deal with the}} situation of the applicant’s counsel in light of Article 17(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which parties <b>other</b> than any <b>EFTA</b> State, ESA, the European Union and the Commission must be represented by a lawyer. The Court examined the relationship between the applicant and the two lawyers that signed the application. The independence of one lawyer was not found to be affected by her position as head of the Business Legislation Department of NHO as the Court had not been provided with information demonstrating that the interests of NHO were largely the same as those of the applicant. The other lawyer was also deemed sufficiently independent from the applicant as an employee of an independent law firm, from where she continued to receive her salary, regardless of a contract between NHO and the law firm for the temporary provision of her services. The applicant was thus found to be properly represented before the Court, showing that the right of audience of in-house counsel must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
40|$|Differently {{from other}} {{international}} tribunals {{set up in}} the context of regional economic integrations, the existing relationship between the EFTA Court and the ECJ, having been “institutionalized” at a primary level by the EEA Agreement itself, is naturally apt to give rise to a structural, natural and original interdependence between the two phenomena of mirror jurisdiction and mirror legislation. The relevance of the ECJ case law for the EFTA case law {{is not limited to the}} references to the former court case law, which can be found in all the advisory opinions and in all the judgments given up to now by the latter. It also and above all reveals itself in the constant adoption both of the reasoning made by the ECJ and of the constitutional principles of EU law. By putting on the same level its jurisprudence and that of the ECJ, the EFTA Court attributes to both of them the same efficacy in terms of judicial precedent. This does not mean that the EFTA Court has restricted itself to passively adopt the ECJ case law. EFTA judges have had a relevant influence on the ECJ in the course of the years. In doing so the EFTA Court has built up a strong judicial dialogue with the ECJ, according to the EEA principle that the interpretation and application of EEA law and EU law must be carried out “in full deference to the independence of courts”. In some <b>other</b> cases the <b>EFTA</b> Court has even developed reasonings which seem to underline a detachment of the former from the criteria and principles adopted by the ECJ. In this context, the L’Oréal case represents the first and until now only case in which the EFTA Court had to decide on a question which had already been the subject of an explicit conflict with the ECJ. The issue at stake is the admissibility of the principle of international exhaustion of the rights conferred by a trademark, that consequently functions as appropriate sedes materiae for the purpose of clarifying the degree of autonomy characterizing the EFTA Court vis-à-vis the ECJ and its case law. This working paper aims at explaining why and to what extent the choice made and the reasoning developed by the EFTA Court to abandon its previous case law in favour of the ECJ case law in the L’Oréal case seems to be more inspired by political considerations than by a purely legal reasoning. The analysis will then show the reasons why L’Oréal goes beyond the issue of the international exhaustion of the rights conferred by a trade mark and concerns structural and institutional questions pertaining to the legal and economic aims of the EEA law and the EU system. It will be finally underlined in what sense the EEA Agreement must be interpreted and construed as meaning that the uniformity and consistency in the case law of the two courts have to be always and in any case prioritized, notwithstanding the different aims and the lower degree of integration of the EEA system in comparison with the EU legal that seemed to constitute, until L’Oréal, the only exception to the objective of legal homogeneity acknowledged by the EEA Agreement...|$|R
