40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{focus on the}} greenhouse effect {{and the introduction of}} taxation on NOX and CO 2 emissions there has been an increased interest in reducing the emissions from the offshore oil and gas installations to bring down the operating costs. This makes the possible use of combined cycles as a source for power production offshore of great immediate interest. Compared to the simple cycle gas turbines typically used offshore today, combined cycles offer a significantly improved thermal efficiency and as such reduced emissions and fuel consumption. However, the large weight and area requirements for combined cycles are a concern; for offshore applications a compact system is needed. This thesis is an extension of the project work Process simulation of combined cycles for offshore applications, written autumn 2012, and focuses on optimizing the design developed in that work. The design parameters for the system developed in the project work were optimized in MATLAB using a connection between MATLAB and a Microsoft Excel spread sheet linked with GT PRO. The thesis includes the development of an objective function and a screening of the potential MATLAB optimization methods. After the optimization methods were decided upon, adjustments were made to them in an attempt to improve the <b>optimized</b> <b>solution,</b> and a brief comparison of the different optimization methods was carried out. Finally, the best <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> compared to that of the project work, both in respect to the individual design parameters and total system performance. Through this thesis it has become apparent that the selection of objective function is of paramount importance, the <b>optimized</b> <b>solution</b> will only <b>be</b> as good as the selected function. In terms of the optimization methods, there were fairly small differences between the various algorithms, though the pattern search with a MADSPositiveBasis 2 N search algorithm seemed to be a good option for obtaining the best possible solution. In comparison to the design developed in the project work, there were noticeable improvements to be had in terms of power production and weight savings. Overall, the main components of the <b>optimized</b> <b>solution</b> <b>were</b> 493 kg lighter and able to produce an additional 268 kW when compared to the project work, corresponding to a 2. 6 % improvement {{in the value of the}} selected objective function.

Overall it appears to be quite advantageous to optimize the design of combined cycles for offshore oil and gas installations. Once a suitable objective function is established a quite good <b>optimized</b> <b>solution</b> can <b>be</b> realized in relatively short time. It does not appear to be necessary with many adjustments to the optimization parameters, though adjustments can be made if a better <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> sought after. </p...|$|R

40|$|Designing {{sustainable}} {{production systems}} that are respectful {{of the environment and}} produce safe food of quality is a challenge for the future. A critical step is to find the best combinations of genetic resources and cultural practices adapted to target environments. The objective of this work is to illustrate how an ecophysiological process-based simulation model could be possibly used to design genotypes and to propose innovative production systems, by applying a methodology of optimization. As example, we studied the peach-brown rot system and used the ‘Virtual Fruit’, a process-based model that has been extensively tested, to perform virtual experiments. The challenge was to optimize the trade-off between antagonistic criteria of major importance for both fruit quality (increasing fruit mass and sweetness) and sensitivity to brown rot (decreasing skin density of cracks) in four different cultural scenarios. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, namely NSGA-II, was applied to solve this multiobjective optimization problem based on the ‘Virtual Fruit’. The optimized variables were six parameters of the ‘Virtual Fruit’, {{selected on the basis of}} a sensitivity analysis. This optimization method provided a large diversity of solutions among which the decision-maker can choose the best suited trade-off between criteria according to a particular objective. Most of the <b>optimized</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>were</b> distributed along Pareto fronts suggesting a good convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, it also provided some solutions located in non-crowded zones which constitute some original alternatives for the final decision-maker. The results confirmed the strong antagonism between the criteria considered. Large fruits had a weak sweetness and high crack density and for a given mass, those with improved sweetness had higher crack density. In a current breeding scheme, fruit mass would be the only criteria considered but alternative schemes could be considered for future, favoring organoleptic quality or environment friendly practices. In those cases, some interesting <b>optimized</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>were</b> identified. The work described in this paper supports that multiobjective evolutionary algorithms should be used to optimize parameters of process-based models and help identifying trade-off in complex systems. The use of the ‘Virtual Fruit’ to design sustainable production systems combining genotypes and innovative practices is further discussed...|$|R
