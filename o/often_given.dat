5|$|In later medieval tellings of the war, {{the episode}} of Troilus and Briseida/Cressida is {{acknowledged}} and <b>often</b> <b>given</b> {{as a reason}} for Diomedes and Troilus to seek each other out in battle. The love story also becomes one that is told separately.|$|E
5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including atrial fibrillation and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is <b>often</b> <b>given</b> simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Many Lingbao {{beliefs are}} {{borrowed}} from Buddhism. The {{names of the}} many different deities and heavens were <b>often</b> <b>given</b> titles based on phonetic transcriptions of Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit terms were borrowed phonetically, but given completely different meanings. One significant concept borrowed from Buddhism was that of reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1877, Trial by Jury was <b>often</b> <b>given</b> at benefit performances, {{usually for}} an actor or actress {{who had fallen}} on hard times, but {{occasionally}} for other causes. These were glittering affairs, with various celebrities appearing in principal roles {{or as part of}} the chorus. Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions.|$|E
5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, {{especially in}} the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were <b>often</b> <b>given</b> sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew {{does not seem to be}} recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E
5|$|At 06:30 the No. 5 Wing {{attacked}} the Ottoman defences, drawing some fire which revealed {{the locations of}} machine guns, trenches and five redoubts. The redoubts were arranged around the village, which protected the only available water supply in the area. During the day, pilots and their observers provided frequent reports; fourteen were received between 07:50 and 15:15, giving estimated positions, strength, and movements of the Ottoman garrison. These were most <b>often</b> <b>given</b> verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel's headquarters, as the aircraft did not at this time have wireless communication.|$|E

5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was <b>often</b> <b>given</b> an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was <b>often</b> <b>given</b> as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, <b>often</b> <b>given</b> to heroes who perished {{in the line of}} duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Leif {{was the son}} of Erik the Red and {{his wife}} Thjodhild, and the {{grandson}} of Thorvaldr Ásvaldsson, and distant relative of Naddodd, who discovered Iceland. He was a Viking in the early days. His year of birth is most <b>often</b> <b>given</b> as c. 970 or c. 980. Though Leif's birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas, it is likely he was born in Iceland, where his parents met—probably somewhere on the edge of Breiðafjörður, and possibly at the farm Haukadal where Thjóðhild's family {{is said to have been}} based. Leif had two brothers, whose names were Thorsteinn and Thorvaldr, and a sister, Freydís.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (<b>often</b> <b>given</b> the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy is <b>often</b> <b>given</b> {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud is <b>often</b> <b>given</b> as {{an example}} of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E

The White Sox have used 62 Opening Day starting pitchers since they were established as a Major League team in 1901. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is <b>often</b> <b>given</b> to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The White Sox have a record of 60 wins and 53 losses in their Opening Day games, through the 2013 season.|$|E

5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were <b>often</b> <b>given</b> handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} a mixture of action, adventure, puzzle-solving, and role-playing video game.
