25|$|In England and Wales, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> arms is {{regarded}} as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> England, and <b>the</b> common <b>law</b> courts will take judicial notice of it as such.

But <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> arms is not part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> common <b>law</b> Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> arms was most influenced by <b>the</b> civil <b>law</b> and may be regarded as similar to <b>the</b> ecclesiastical <b>law,</b> which is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> England influenced by canon law, but not part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common <b>law.</b>|$|R

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence {{of this has been}} observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
