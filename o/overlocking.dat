5000|$|<b>Overlock,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "serging" [...] or [...] "serger stitch", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, {{and one or two}} loopers. <b>Overlock</b> sewing {{machines}} are usually equipped with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial <b>overlock</b> machines are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam {{does not need to be}} pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of <b>overlock</b> stitch. <b>Overlock</b> machines with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an <b>overlock</b> stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a [...] "safety stitch". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a mock safety.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>overlock</b> {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an <b>overlock</b> sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such {{machines}} being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows <b>overlock</b> machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An <b>overlock</b> sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overlock</b> sewing {{machines}} usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, {{and most are}} used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. <b>Overlock</b> stitches are extremely versatile, {{as they can be}} used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.|$|R

5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary <b>overlocking</b> machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|E

30|$|The {{direction}} of pant lining fabric used was a cross grain (92.3 %, 12 out of 13). This {{is because it}} has several benefits. The cross grain direction has less shrinkage than a lengthwise direction. In addition, the selvage of lining fabric {{can be used for}} hemming of the pants lining without an additional <b>overlocking</b> process, saving both time and fabric consumption. Interesting results were obtained in contrast to that of the women’s pants and other garments, which used the selvage direction as vertical use of grain in a traditional manner.|$|E
50|$|On mass-produced clothing, {{the seam}} {{allowances}} of plain seams are usually trimmed and stitched {{together with an}} <b>overlock</b> stitch using a serger. Plain seams may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an <b>overlock</b> stitch. Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine overcasting.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Merrow was {{the driving}} force behind Merrow {{developing}} new technology, growing the new business and transforming it from a regional supplier of crochet sewing machines, to the market leader manufacturing hundreds of models of industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing machines. Under his leadership the company achieved a place of prominence in the industrial machine field with sales world-wide, hundreds of patents and the industries first industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing machine.|$|R

30|$|As {{illustrated}} above, most menswear brands {{provided the}} pants lining pattern to the garment factories. The pants style (suit pants and casual pants), {{as well as}} both circumference and length ease were important factors. The connecting method was <b>overlocking</b> the lining fabric onto the outer shell fabric. The direction of the lining fabric used was crosswise grain line, which {{is in contrast to}} the information for the womenswear manufacturers and designers. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could be a great asset for new menswear and womenswear manufacturers and fashion designers.|$|E
30|$|First, in general, {{menswear}} brands {{provide the}} pants lining pattern to the factory. The pant style (suit or casual) {{and the outer}} shell fabric’s degree of stretch were important factors {{with regards to the}} patternmaking method of the pants lining. The sewing method of pants lining has several steps. For example, attaching the lining fabric onto the outer shell fabric using an <b>overlocking</b> stitch must be done first. Then, the sewing of both layers together can be done to construct the remainder of the pant. Interestingly, it was noted that the direction of the grain line was crosswise instead of lengthwise for the lining fabric.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{researchers}} analyzed {{the process of}} how to combine the lining and outer shell fabrics, along with manufacturing the pocket and darts on the pants. There were two cases of construction methods found for these areas of the pants. In the first case, after stitching the lining to the outer shell by using an <b>overlocking</b> stitch, manufacturers sewed two layers (lining and outer shell) of the darts and pocket. This method of construction was not expected and was done for a lower manufacturing price. In the second case, the sewing of the darts and pocket {{of the outer shell}} and the lining were done separately, then the lining piece was attached to the outer shell at the waistline.|$|E
30|$|The {{construction}} {{method that}} connected a lining fabric {{to the outer}} shell fabric was separate over-locking sewing steps (the front lining was <b>overlocked</b> to front outer shell, the back was <b>overlocked</b> to the back outer shell), then all were sewn together (84.6 %, 11 out of 13). The important factors {{on the length of}} the lining pattern were “the comfortableness on the knee area” (53.8 %, 7 out of 13) and “product cost by fabric consumption” (30.8 %, 4 out of 13).|$|R
50|$|In 1877 the world's first {{crochet machine}} was invented and {{patented}} by Joseph M.

This crochet machine was the first production <b>overlock</b> sewing machine. The Merrow Machine Company {{went on to become}} one of the largest American Manufacturers of <b>overlock</b> sewing machines, and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.|$|R

40|$|Women {{traveller}} writers {{from the}} white settler colonies of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand who move between colonial peripheries and metropolitan centres, position themselves outside national boundaries, obliquely representing their relationship to home and host societies. For these cosmopolitans such side stepping of national categories, fosters {{a sense of belonging}} in words and fictive spaces. In being accountable to more than one concept of home, more likely to be a ‘cultural traveller or an extraterritorial’ than a national (Elleke Boehmer Colonial and Postcolonial Literature, OUP, 2005, p. 227) the traveller writer offers complex constructions of literary identity, inflected by <b>overlocking</b> and intersecting images of self and other, home and abroad, authenticity and authority. This paper will refer to New Zealand writing of the 20 th century as a case study. Focussing on the work of Katherine Mansfield, Janet Frame and Fleur Adcock, it will argue that their representations of journeys and travel constitute a translational ‘third’ space between colony and host society, a place where identity structures can be undone and remade. As cultural agents, they show in their work a continuing renegotiation {{of the relationship between the}} white settler society and the metropolitan homelan...|$|E

The average front crotch ease was 0.43  cm. This minimum ease was also 0  cm and the maximum ease was 1  cm. This front crotch ease {{was similar to the}} comparative literature data of 0.5  cm. The average back crotch ease was 0.52  cm. This minimum ease was also 0  cm, while the maximum ease was 1.1  cm. The back crotch ease was used only if there is a back lining, as in some casual pants. The back crotch ease was 0.52  cm. This minimum ease was also 0  cm while the maximum ease was 1.1  cm. The length ease of 0.07  cm on the lining gave room when <b>overlocking</b> the lining fabric to outer shell fabric. The average knee ease was 0.61  cm. The information documented from this study was new, since there was no written guide or reference for this lengthwise ease of the pants lining.|$|E
