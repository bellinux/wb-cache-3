5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Although the {{clinical}} relevance <b>of</b> minor <b>depression</b> {{has been demonstrated}} in many studies, the economic costs are not well explored. In this study, we examine the economic costs <b>of</b> minor <b>depression.</b> Method: In a large-scale, population-based study in the Netherlands (n = 5504) the costs <b>of</b> minor <b>depression</b> were compared with the costs <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> and dysthymia. Excess costs, i. e. the costs of a disorder {{over and above the}} costs attributable to other illnesses, were estimated with help of regression analysis. The direct medical costs, the direct non-medical costs and the indirect non-medical costs were calculated. The year 2003 was used as the reference year. Results: The annual per capita excess costs <b>of</b> minor <b>depression</b> were US$ 2141 (95 % CI = 753 - 3529) higher than the base rate costs of US$ 1023, while the costs <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> were US$ 3313 (95 % CI = 1234 - 5390) higher than the base rate. The costs <b>of</b> minor <b>depression</b> per 1 million inhabitants were 160 million dollars per year, which is somewhat less than the costs <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> (192 million dollars per year). Conclusion: The economic costs associated with minor depression are considerable and approach those <b>of</b> major <b>depression.</b> © 2007 The Authors...|$|R

The risks <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause.

40|$|Modeling hydrologic {{processes}} for depression-dominated {{areas such as}} the North American Prairie Pothole Region is complex and reliant on a clear understanding of dynamic filling-spilling-merging-splitting processes <b>of</b> numerous <b>depressions</b> over the surface. Puddles are spatially distributed over a watershed and their sizes, storages, and interactions vary over time. However, most hydrologic models fail to account for these dynamic processes. Like other traditional methods, depressions are filled as a required preprocessing step in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The objective {{of this study was to}} facilitate hydrologic modeling for depression-dominated areas by coupling SWAT with a Puddle Delineation (PD) algorithm. In the coupled PD-SWAT model, the PD algorithm was utilized to quantify topographic details, including the characteristics, distribution, and hierarchical relationships <b>of</b> <b>depressions,</b> which were incorporated into SWAT at the hydrologic response unit (HRU) scale. The new PD-SWAT model was tested for a large watershed in North Dakota under real precipitation events. In addition, hydrologic modeling of a small watershed was conducted under two extreme high and low synthetic precipitation conditions. In particular, the PD-SWAT was compared against the regular SWAT based on depressionless DEMs. The impact <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> on the hydrologic modeling of the large and small watersheds was evaluated. The simulation results for the large watershed indicated that SWAT systematically overestimated the outlet discharge, which can be attributed to the failure to account for the hydrologic effects <b>of</b> <b>depressions.</b> It was found from the PD-SWAT modeling results that at the HRU scale surface runoff initiation was significantly delayed due to the threshold control <b>of</b> <b>depressions.</b> Under the high precipitation scenario, depressions increased the surface runoff peak. However, the low precipitation scenario could not fully fill depressions to reach the overflow thresholds in the selected sub-basins. These results suggest the importance <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> as gatekeepers in watershed modeling...|$|R

40|$|A proper {{understanding}} of the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> is necessary to understand how they affect the processing of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for hydrological analysis. While the effect of DEM cell resolution on common terrain derivatives has been well established, this is not well understood for depressions. The more widespread availability of high resolution DEMs derived through Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technologies presents new challenges and opportunities for the characterization <b>of</b> <b>depressions.</b> A 6 -meter LIDAR DEM for a study watershed in North Carolina {{was used to determine}} the effect of DEM cell resolution on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>depressions.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> was found to increase with smaller cell sizes, following an inverse power relationship. Scale-dependency was also found for the average depression surface area, average depression volume, total depression area and total depression volume. Results indicate that for this study area the amount <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> in terms <b>of</b> surface area and volume is at a minimum for cell sizes around 30 to 61 meters. In this resolution range there will still be many artificial depressions, but their presence is less than at lower or higher resolutions. At finer scales, the (small) vertical error of the LIDAR DEM needs to be considered and introduces a large number of small and shallow artificial depressions. At coarser scales, the terrain variability is no longer reliably represented and a substantial number of large and sometimes deep artificial depressions is created. The results presented here support the conclusion that the use of the highest resolution and most accurate data, such as LIDAR-derived DEMs, may not result in the most reliable estimates of terrain derrivatives unless proper consideration is given to the scale-dependency of the parameters being studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were twofold. First, to evaluate in a community sample the age of onset <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> in {{adolescents and young adults}} with and without parental major depression. Second, to examine whether specific clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> in adolescents and young adults are associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> among parents. Baseline and 4 -year follow-up data were used from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), a prospective-longitudinal community study of adolescents and young adults. Results are based on 470 subjects who completed the follow-up, for whom diagnostic information for both parents was available, and who reported at least one episode <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> according to DSM-IV-criteria through second follow-up. Diagnostic assessment in respondents was accomplished by using the standardized Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). Information on major depression in parents was collected as family history information from the respondents, and additionally from M-CIDI diagnostic interviews with parents of the younger cohort. Both recurrence and impairment as clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> in adolescents and young adults were associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> among parents. Age of onset as well as overall higher impairment as clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> in youth were associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> parental major <b>depression</b> in the univariate, but not in the multiple, analyses. Our findings suggest that clinical features <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> may indicate familial subtypes of the disorder, most evident for recurrence and impairment.
