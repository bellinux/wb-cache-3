5|$|During World War II, Goebel {{served in}} the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Commander on an {{aircraft}} carrier. His final game as an <b>official</b> <b>was</b> the 1952 Rose Bowl between Illinois and Stanford, {{in which he was}} the head linesman.|$|E
5|$|Further scandal {{followed}} in the 1926–27 season when title-winners Torino Football Club were stripped of their Scudetto following an FIGC investigation. A Torino <b>official</b> <b>was</b> found to have bribed opposing defender Luigi Allemandi in Torino's match against Juventus on 5 June 1927, and thus the season finished with no declared champions.|$|E
5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state <b>official</b> <b>was</b> to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E

5|$|A {{squad of}} 16 members, {{built around the}} core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily {{assembled}} by Liz Dreyer, {{the president of the national}} women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and <b>official</b> <b>was</b> white. Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E
5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of <b>Official</b> <b>was</b> held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this <b>official</b> <b>was</b> to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E
25|$|Economic tension {{caused by}} war was serious. As famine spread, looting and crimes <b>were</b> widespread. Corrupt <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> {{reportedly}} abundant. According to some sources, many oppressions and abuses made by <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> reported. King Taksin punished them harshly, torturing and executing high officials. Discontent among <b>officials</b> could <b>be</b> expected.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} months of the occupation, new <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> {{appointed}} to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba'ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the American and British presence. Certain religious clerics and other <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> considered to be overly radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> found to behave less than admirably. On 30 June 2003, the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.|$|R
50|$|Further {{complicating the}} job of an <b>official</b> <b>is</b> the {{proximity}} to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within {{a few feet of}} the <b>official,</b> as <b>are</b> coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.|$|R
5|$|ISI {{reported}} after questioning {{survivors of}} the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound {{at the time of}} the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security <b>official</b> <b>was</b> quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Many central {{government}} officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery-level administrations. There are only rare cases (i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han) when subordinate officers of county-level administrations {{advanced to the}} level of {{central government}}. Even if one secured an office by these means, an <b>official</b> <b>was</b> still expected to be competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those aspiring to fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These students could be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1820s, Oregon City {{developed}} near Willamette Falls. It {{was incorporated}} in 1844, {{becoming the first}} city west of the Rocky Mountains to have that distinction. John McLoughlin, a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) <b>official,</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the major}} contributors to the founding of the town in 1829. McLoughlin attempted to persuade the British government (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American colonization of the area, all against the HBC's orders. Oregon City prospered because of the paper mills that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. Linn City (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.|$|E
50|$|High {{government}} <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> appointed {{from the}} aristocracy. Monk <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> usually drawn from Lhasa middle classes, {{the families of}} existing monk <b>officials,</b> or <b>were</b> the second sons of the aristocracy. They were usually monks in name only, one night spent in a monastery being sufficient to qualify as a monk for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|A main {{distinction}} between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours {{a system in}} which top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> elected directly, by public election, and <b>officials</b> can <b>be</b> removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.|$|R
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each <b>official</b> <b>was</b> able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The CIA put {{the plan}} into motion in late 1952. A {{freighter}} {{that had been}} borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons {{under the guise of}} agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior <b>official</b> <b>was</b> asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.|$|E
5|$|Under Secretary Wu Guanzheng, the CCDI {{established}} {{its first}} central inspection teams in August 2003. These teams, led by retired ministerial-level officials and {{reporting to the}} CCDI rather than local party committees, were empowered to initiate investigations, conduct interviews and review relevant documents. The opinion of a central inspection team was {{an important factor in}} determining whether or not an <b>official</b> <b>was</b> disciplined, and the teams {{played an important role in}} the expulsion of Shanghai party chief (and Politburo member) Chen Liangyu from the party because of corruption.|$|E

5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support of the opposing Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department <b>official,</b> <b>was</b> convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{initially}} rallied {{support from}} his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount Vũ Quang, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who {{had been removed from}} office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced <b>official</b> <b>was</b> now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of Nghệ An Province.|$|E

50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{is the need}} for a prompt and irrevocable decision. Election results need to be confirmed promptly, before <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office. In many commercial uses of information technology, managers can reverse computer errors even when detected long after the event. However, once elected <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office, they begin to make decisions such as voting on legislation or signing contracts on behalf of the government. Even if the <b>official</b> <b>were</b> to be removed because a computer error was discovered to have put that official in office, it would not be possible to reverse all the consequences of the error.|$|R
