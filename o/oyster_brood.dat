40|$|Increasing {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide}} is altering marine carbonate chemistry through a process called ocean acidification. Many calcium carbonate forming organisms are sensitive to changes in marine carbonate chemistry, especially mollusk bivalve larvae at the initial shell building stage. Rapid calcification, limited energy reserves, and more exposed calcification surfaces, are traits at this stage that increase vulnerability to ocean acidification through our previously argued kinetic-energetic hypothesis. These developmental traits are common to broadcast spawning bivalve species that {{are the focus of}} most ocean acidification studies to date. Some <b>oyster</b> species <b>brood</b> their young, which results in slower development of the embryos through the initial shell formation stage. We examined the responses of the <b>brooding</b> Olympia <b>oyster,</b> Ostrea lurida, during their initial shell building stage. We extracted fertilized eggs from, O. lurida, prior to shell development, then exposed developing embryos {{to a wide range of}} marine carbonate chemistry conditions. Surprisingly, O. lurida showed no acute negative response to any ocean acidification treatments. Compared to the broadcast spawning Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, calcification rate and standardized endogenous energy lipid consumption rate were nearly 10 and 50 times slower, respectively. Our results suggest that slow shell building may lessen the energetic burden of acidification at this stage and provides additional support for our kinetic-energetic hypothesis. Furthermore, these results may represent an example of exaptation; fitness conveyed by a coopted trait that evolved for another purpose, a concept largely lacking in the current perspective of adaptation and global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} monogamy is {{adaptive}} in resource-specialist symbiotic crustaceans inhabiting relatively small and morphologically simple hosts in tropical environments where predation risk away from hosts is high. We tested this prediction in Pontonia manningi, a hyper-symbiotic shrimp that dwells in the mantle cavity of the Atlantic winged oyster Pteria colymbus that, in turn, infects gorgonians from the genus Pseudopterogorgia in the Caribbean Sea. In agreement with theory, P. manningi were found dwelling as heterosexual pairs in oysters {{more frequently than}} expected by chance alone. Males and females also inhabited the same host individual independent of the female gravid condition or of the developmental stage of brooded embryos. While the observations above argue in favor of monogamy in P. manningi, {{there is evidence to}} suggest that males of the studied species are moderately promiscuous. That females found living solitary in <b>oysters</b> most often <b>brooded</b> embryos, and that males allocated more to weaponry (major claw size) than females at any given size suggest that males might be roaming among host individuals in search of and, fighting for, receptive females. All available information depicts a rather complex mating system in P. manningi: primarily monogamous but with moderately promiscuous males...|$|R
25|$|Oysters had {{thrived in}} the Thames Estuary since the Romans {{promoted}} them; they {{were sold in}} city streets and eaten raw. The Herne Bay, Hampton and Reculver Oyster Fishery Company was incorporated with £10,000 capital in £10 shares on 25 July 1864 with Frank Buckland as chairman and Mr Cholmondeley Pennell as deputy. 1860–1864 had been a boom year for oyster farming, especially in nearby Whitstable, and the Government supported the trade in 1866 by passing an Act to promote cultivation. The company's proposals included five oyster smacks or yawls, a pier with storehouses, housing for workers and five freshwater breeding ponds. In spite of objections from local business competition, the company acquired an Act of Parliament and land at Hampton. According to the Act of 25 July 1864, the company had sole rights to dredge for oysters for seven miles (11km) from Swalecliffe to Reculver and up to three miles (5km) – but mainly {{one and a half}} miles – from shore. The total area under its jurisdiction was nine square miles, of which a third was foreshore, and it employed thirty-three regular men; sometimes up to a hundred. In 1865 and 1866 their chairman Cholmondeley Pennell applied unsuccessfully for extensions to these rights. Before selling the oysters dredged from the Estuary, the company obtained <b>brood</b> <b>oysters</b> from Essex, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.

40|$|The {{parasite}} Bonamia ostreae has decimated Ostrea edulis stocks throughout Europe. The complete {{life cycle}} {{and means of}} transmission of the parasite remains unknown. The methods used to diagnose B. ostreae were examined to determine sensitivity and reproducibility. Two methods, with fixed protocols, {{should be used for}} the accurate detection of infection within a sample. A 13 -month study of two stocks of O. edulis with varying periods of exposure to B. ostreae, was undertaken to determine if varying lengths of exposure would translate into observations of differing susceptibility. Oyster stocks can maintain themselves over extended periods of time in B. ostreae endemic areas. To identify a well performing spat stock, which could be used to repopulate beds within the region, hatchery bred spat from three stocks found in the North sea were placed on a B. ostreae infected bed and screened for growth, mortality and prevalence of infection. Local environmental factors may influence oyster performance, with local stocks better adapted to these conditions. Sediment and macroinvertebrate species were screened to investigate mechanisms by which B. ostreae may be maintaining itself on oyster beds. Mytilus edulis was positive, indicating that B. ostreae may use incidental carriers as a method of maintaining itself. The ability of oyster larvae to pick up infection from the surrounding environment was investigated by collecting larvae from <b>brooding</b> <b>oysters</b> from different areas. Larvae may acquire the pathogen from the water column during the process of filter feeding by the brooding adult, even when the parents themselves are uninfected.

40|$|Human {{activities}} are causing a global loss {{of plant and}} animal species, degrading ecosystem properties and threatening ecosystem services. One indicator of these losses is the increasing proportion of fish stocks in decline, and the Challenger oyster fishery in Tasman Bay, central New Zealand is an example of one such fishery. Anthropogenic effects from land-based activities, and towed-gear fishing have been implicated as contributors to the decline of shellfisheries and degradation of the marine ecosystem in Tasman Bay. Increased sedimentation in the bay caused by soil erosion and runoff associated with forestry, agriculture and subdivision is likely to have a range of negative effects on the benthic community. Also towed-gear fishing, dredging and trawling homogenise benthic habitat structure (reduce habitat heterogeneity) and facilitate sediment resuspension as well as causing removal and direct physical damage to benthic biota. There is an imperative to seek to mitigate these effects and look at ways to restore the benthic community including the commercial shellfish species. In this context, my central hypothesis was that enhancement of the benthic habitat by returning waste shell to the seabed would increase oyster production for the fishery. Related to this main goal of oyster fishery enhancement, a primary objective {{of the study was to}} fill knowledge gaps relating to the biology and ecology of the oyster in Tasman Bay. The second main topic of my thesis was to investigate how this form of habitat enhancement would alter the benthic community structure, and potentially aid in restoration of the wider ecosystem in the bay. I sought to link the twin goals of fishery enhancement and ecological restoration by considering potential management measures to promote a sustainable oyster fishery and at the same time facilitate ecological restoration within Tasman Bay. The investigations focused on four main themes: temporal patterns of oyster larval abundance, spatial patterns of spatfall and larval dispersal, effects of habitat enhancement on oyster population productivity, and effects of habitat enhancement on the benthic faunal community. Laboratory and field studies were conducted between October 2004 and May 2009. A peak period of oyster reproductive activity began in late spring and continued through summer in each year. Maximum rates of adult <b>oysters</b> <b>brooding</b> larvae were 17 % in November 2004 and 2005, and 23 % in December 2006. Over the entire summer breeding period it was estimated that 55 to 78 % of adult oysters incubated larvae. A very low level of brooding activity (1 %) occurred during winter. Temporal trends in larval settlement closely tracked brooding patterns. Settlement on collectors deployed in Tasman Bay was greatest between November and January, and there were very low rates in winter. Results are useful in optimising the timing of substratum deployment in an enhancement program for the oyster fishery. Spat settlement density was strongly related to background adult oyster density. Spat settlement on experimental arrays deployed through the water column only occurred within a narrow vertical range very close to (< 1 m above) the seabed. If suitable habitat is available for settlement, oysters tend to settle within a few hours after release, but approximately half of the larvae settled in a laboratory experiment were capable of remaining viable for several days. Oyster distribution assessed at the scale of the shellfishing industry’s annual biomass survey (median distance between sample tows ~ 1 km) is adequate to broadly predict spat settlement distribution in the subsequent settlement season, and the distribution of mature oysters is a key determinant in the placement of shell for habitat enhancement to maximise spat settlement. Deployment of waste whole scallop shell on the seabed as settlement substratum increased oyster spat density significantly. Available settlement surface on enhanced shell plots decreased by 82 % in the five months after deployment, due to fouling by numerous invertebrates and sedimentation. Survival of oysters recruited to enhanced habitat was generally very low, and varied greatly among 4 experimental sites and through time. After 3 + years, survival among site/treatment combinations ranged from 0 % to 0. 04 %. At the site where survival was greatest, the absolute density of oysters surviving to 3. 41 years on enhanced habitat was estimated as 0. 4 m⁻². This equated to an increase in relative density of commercial sized oysters from ~ 0. 01 m⁻² prior to enhancement, to ~ 0. 14 m⁻² at the end of the experiment, and demonstrated that habitat enhancement can elevate adult oyster densities to commercial levels on areas of seabed where oysters were previously below threshold densities for commercial fishing (0. 02 m⁻²). Peaks in mortality occurred within experimental plots when oysters were less than one year old, and three years old. Growth modeling indicated that after 4. 25 years, 98 % of living oysters would attain legal size (≥ 58 mm length), and 92 % would attain sufficient shell depth (≥ 20 mm) to provide high grade (grade A in the industry) meat. Shell depth was a better morphometric predictor of meat weight than either shell height or shell length. The species assemblages on the shell-enhanced habitat were distinct from those on adjacent non-enhanced seabed. Measures of taxonomic and functional richness, faunal densities, and taxonomic redundancy within functional groups all increased in enhanced habitat. Beta and gamma diversity also increased due to patchiness of the habitat created within enhanced experimental sites. Large scale habitat enhancement in Tasman Bay via the deposition of waste shell on the seabed is likely to confer benefits to ecosystem function associated with those community level effects. To sustain an oyster fishery in Tasman Bay, an ecosystem-based approach to fishery management is recommended to facilitate restoration of benthic habitats and communities and to help maintain ecosystem function supporting all components of the benthic community, including the oyster population. Planning and implementation of a combination of specific management measures including habitat enhancement, rotational fishing, permanent exclusion of towed fishing gear from a network of protected areas, and integration of the management of the oyster, scallop, and finfish fisheries would provide the best chance for restoration and maintenance of a sustainable oyster fishery...|$|R
40|$|The flat or native oyster, Ostrea angasi (Sowerby, 1871), {{was once}} a {{conspicuous}} inhabitant of many coastal bays and estuaries in south eastern Australia and {{formed the basis of}} a thriving wild fishery. Overfishing led to population collapses in NSW, Victoria, Tasmanian and South Australia, which in turn saw local demand for oysters being met through the production of Sydney rock oysters and the introduced Pacific oyster. As markets have developed and factors such as disease have impacted the production of other oyster species, there has been a renewed interest in production of O. angasi within the southern states. O. angasi are sequential protandric hermaphrodites and larviparous, with brooding adults retaining larvae on the gill filaments in the brachial chamber for approximately half the larval life cycle. Wild catch of O. angasi spat is low and unreliable and the cultivation of this species is reliant upon hatchery production. To date production techniques for O. angasi have been loosely based on those used for Saccostrea glomerata and Crassostrea gigas, and have varied in success, with many hatcheries still reporting poor outcomes. In part this has arisen from a lack of systematic assessments of the fundamental variables that determine hatchery success. Specifically, improvements in O. angasi production output and reliability require an improved understanding of the reproductive biology of the species and knowledge of conditions required to optimise late larval development and metamorphosis. In the first instance hatchery production is underpinned by the reproductive biology and ecology of this species. Knowledge of the temporal frequency of reproduction within New South Wales (NSW) estuaries is essential for larval acquisition {{and the development of a}} hatchery program. To address this, oysters were sampled over a 12 month period, across four estuaries, and examined histologically to reveal marked differences in gametogenic patterns to that previously reported in the southern states of Australia. The frequency of <b>brooding</b> <b>oysters</b> among farmed populations of O. angasi, in NSW waters, extended beyond that recorded in the Southern states of Australia. In the most northern and southern estuaries examined, <b>brooding</b> <b>oysters</b> were found between eight to nine months of the year with little synchronicity observed in reproductive timing within and between estuaries. Temperature, previously thought to halt gametogenic activity, was not restrictive to O. angasi reproduction in NSW farmed populations. For oviparous oyster species, assessments of larval rearing techniques frequently address specific ontogenetic stages, which begin with fertilisation success and culminate in competency and metamorphosis. For O. angasi, advanced stage larvae are acquired directly from brood-stock and greater emphasis is on the settlement and metamorphosis. This study sought to better understand the influence of the larval rearing environment on the morphological changes and physiological mechanisms associated with metamorphosis in O. angasi. Accordingly, techniques to reliably induce metamorphosis in competent larvae were assessed, and based upon these outcomes the impact of diet, temperature and salinity on later stage larvae were assessed, all with a view to improve O. angasi hatchery outcomes. Several neuroactive catecholamines (epinephrine, epinephrine bitartrate, L- 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenalalanine and gamma amino butyric acid) were trialed to induce metamorphosis of O. angasi larvae. The optimal dose and duration of exposure of epinephrine and epinephrine bitartrate was determined by induced metamorphosis of O. angasi larvae. The capability to induce rapid metamorphosis in competent O. angasi, aside from single seed production for industry, offers an invaluable tool to assess the effects of rearing conditions on larval development and acquisition of competency. Using epinephrine induced metamorphosis, the influence of algal diet, rearing salinity and temperature on survival, growth and development of hatchery reared O. angasi, larvae was investigated. A comparison of dietary requirements for early stage larvae (140 - 230 μm shell length) and late stage larvae (230 - 340 μm shell length) was made. A series of uni, binary and ternary algal diets were assessed for their effect on the development of competency by induced larval metamorphosis. Optimal salinity (30 to 35) and temperature (26 to 29 oC) were determined for larval rearing, larvae reared outside these salinity and temperature range exhibited, reduced growth, survival and/or delayed development. The effects of short term (1 h) reduction in larval rearing temperature from 26 oC significantly increased larval metamorphosis without affecting larval survival. However, short term increase in larval rearing temperature from 26 oC adversely effected larval survival and metamorphosis, high lighting the need to assess rearing conditions during this critical stage of development. To ensure repeatability in outcomes, tests showed larvae sourced from different estuaries did not vary significantly in their metamorphic response to short term temperature manipulation and epinephrine induced metamorphosis. Collectively the work in this thesis has significantly increased our understanding of O. angasi reproductive patterns and larval biology. The seasonal availability of larvae and the effects of the main environmental factors purported to influence reproduction of O. angasi have been examined. The environmental factors that can be easily and economically adjusted for greater larval rearing success were determined. Additionally, this work adds to the broader understanding of the acquisition of competency and larval metamorphosis in bivalve molluscs. Commercially, O. angasi hatchery outcomes have been highly variable; however, beyond having developed protocols for the use of settlement inducers, significant improvements in hatchery success have accrued. At the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute, a facility that has produced commercial quantities of O. angasi spat for over 15 years, the cumulative improvements in larval rearing technology described in this thesis have increased the percentage of larvae that successfully metamorphose from an historical average of approximately 57...|$|R
