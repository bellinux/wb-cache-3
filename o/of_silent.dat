5|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. Within {{the month of}} its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with {{the greatest number of}} sales in North America. English-language critics praised the atmosphere, graphics, story and monster designs <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill 2, but criticized the controls as being difficult to use although much improved over its predecessor. Since its release, the game has appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics as well as its soundtrack/sound design. Because of the success <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill 2, a sequel titled Silent Hill 3 was released in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Harry Mason as he {{searches}} for his missing adopted {{daughter in the}} eponymous fictional American town <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill; stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin.

5|$|The object <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill 2 is {{to guide}} player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James {{moving in the}} direction that he is facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E

The Russian Guild of Film Critics voted it the sixth-best film from the first half-century of Russian cinema (1908-1957).

Given its context and subtext, it must also be considered one of the most important films in early Soviet cinema history.|$|R

5|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers <b>of</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, a deaf and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator. With former titles like Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said {{the story was}} grim or dark. However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era <b>of</b> <b>silent</b> cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} <b>of</b> <b>silent</b> cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and {{a small number of}} large shots.|$|E

Pyramid Head is also seen controlling the carousel where Heather and Alessa face off against each other, then it kills the cult leader Claudia Wolf after the amulet shows her inner, monstrous nature.|$|E
