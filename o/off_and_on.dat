5|$|The {{final report}} of the committee, which became {{the first draft of}} the Constitution, was the first {{workable}} constitutional plan, as Madison's Virginia Plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad structure.

5|$|Lazzell was matriculated {{into the}} West Virginia University (WVU) in 1901 {{and decided to}} study fine art.

She took drawing and art history classes from William J. Leonard and studied with Eva E. Hubbard. In June 1905 Lazzell was graduated, earning her degree in fine arts. She continued to study at WVU <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> until 1909, furthering her art studies and twice substituting as a painting teacher for Hubbard. During this time she learned ceramics, gold etching, and china decoration.|$|E
5|$|The Kangaroos {{never forgot}} their roots and {{continued}} to work in Canada <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> through the years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> {{for several years}} before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe {{was involved in a}} substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E
5|$|In June 2000, Team Xtreme began a storyline with T & A (Test and Albert), with Lita {{engaging}} in a rivalry with their manager, Trish Stratus. The rivalry developed into an <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> long-term feud between the two women that lasted until Stratus retired in 2006. The storyline ended shortly after Fully Loaded, where Lita pinned Stratus in a six-person intergender tag team match. Subsequently, Lita began feuding with WWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. In the main event of the August 21, 2000 episode of Raw is War, Lita defeated Stephanie with a moonsault to win the Women's Championship for the first time. The match also featured The Rock as the special guest referee and constant interference from Triple H and Kurt Angle.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1945, {{the attack}} jumped <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> 16 March, Bitche {{fell to the}} 100th Infantry Division. The unit was then {{relieved}} from assignment to XV Corps, and transferred to XXI Corps on 22 March 1945. Taking Neustadt and Ludwigshafen, the division reached the Rhine River on 24 March. On 25 March 1945, the unit was returned from XXI Corps back to VI Corps. On 31 March 1945, the 100th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine and moved south {{in the wake of}} the 10th Armored Division and then east across the Neckar River, establishing and enlarging a bridgehead from 4 to 11 April. Heilbronn fell after nine days of house-to-house combat on 12 April and the division resumed its rapid pursuit of the enemy, reaching Stuttgart by 21 April. The 100th was mopping up along the Neckar, southeast of Stuttgart on 23 April, when it was removed from VI Corps and assigned directly to the Seventh United States Army as an Echelon Above Corps Asset. The division was then assigned primarily to patrolling the sector east of Stuttgart. Shifting to Göppingen on 30 April, the Division engaged in occupational duties as the war in Europe came to an end on V-E Day.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam was {{recorded}} at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The band {{began work on}} the album following the 2004 Vote for Change tour in November 2004, and again employed producer Adam Kasper, who worked with them in predecessor Riot Act. The recording sessions started in February 2005, and worked on it <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> throughout the year, with the sessions being interrupted {{toward the end of}} the year when the band toured North America and South America. The album was completed in early 2006. Bassist Jeff Ament attributed the length of time recording to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder having a child and the band touring in the middle of recording. The album was mixed by Kasper at Studio X.|$|E
5|$|The Lone Star Football League team Amarillo Venom and the NAHL Jr. A hockey team, the Amarillo Bulls both {{play in the}} Amarillo Civic Center. Amarillo {{previously}} hosed {{an independent}} league baseball team, the Amarillo Thunderheads of the American Association, which played its home games in Potter County Memorial Stadium from 2011 to 2015. The city was {{the home of the}} Double-A Amarillo Gold Sox Minor League Baseball team of the Texas League <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> from 1939 to 1982. In 2019, the Texas League's San Antonio Missions plan to relocate to Amarillo under a new name and play at a new $45.5 million downtown ballpark.

5|$|Without Graham, the Browns floundered in 1956. Injuries to two Browns quarterbacks left {{relative}} unknown Tommy O'Connell as the starter, and Cleveland {{finished with}} a 5–7 record, its first losing season. Dante Lavelli and Frank Gatski retired {{at the end of}} the season, leaving Groza as the only original Browns player still on the team. While the Browns' on-field play in 1956 was uninspiring, off-the-field drama developed after a Cleveland-based inventor let Brown test a helmet with a radio transmitter inside. After trying it out in training camp, Brown used the helmet to call plays during the pre-season with long-time backup George Ratterman behind center. The device allowed the coach to direct his quarterback on the fly, giving him an advantage over franchises who had to use messenger players to relay instructions. The Browns used the device <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> into the regular season, and other teams began to experiment with their own radio helmets. Bert Bell, the NFL commissioner, banned the device in October 1956. Today, however, all NFL teams use in-helmet radios to communicate with players.|$|E
