Architects like these, who studied under the Englishman Josiah Conder at the Imperial College like Tatsuno, or overseas like Yamaguchi, laid the development for the advancement of architecture in Japan during the Meiji period. However, these Japanese architects employed in Kobe at large and the foreign ones employed in the foreign settlement were clearly demarcated by their different client groups, and interaction between them was sparse.|$|E

Since then {{the main part of the}} building has served as a home generally for youth, with the exception for a short lived home for African migrant families. The home opened its doors for the youth in 1981, on the initiative of the founder Adrijan Cachia (OFM). During its mission as a home over 600 youth (between 10 and 13 years) residents have received temporal stay at the villa and admittance was irrelevant to religious belief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> It was administered by two Roman Catholic priests and a number of secular workers. Cachia was the first director of the home and was later succeeded by Father P. Eddie Pace (OFM), and last was Father John Abela. The youth were provided with a bedroom (alone or shared) and access to most of the house as common space. The house provided for the needs of the residents, such as a better alternative in the lack of family environment and a social worker as a social reference support. This aimed to prepare the youth for independent living. More government funds, for works and service, were given in 1994. On 9 January (1998) Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the OFM, was received by Pace at the building for breakfast.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to propose <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a {{cloud-based}} integrity management service coupled with a trustworthy client component – in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trust Extension Device (TED) platform – as a means to to increase <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> security evaluation <b>of</b> a client. Thus, in addition to performing authentication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> (e.g. as part <b>of</b> Single Sign-On), <b>the</b> Identity Provider asks that <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> platform be computed and then be evaluated by a trustworthy and independent Cloud-based Integrity Measurement Service (cIMS). The TED platform has been previously developed based on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and allows <b>the</b> integrity measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> environment to be conducted and reported in a secure manner. Within the SSO flow, the portable TED device performs an integrity measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> platform, and sends an integrity report to the cIMS as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> authentication process. <b>The</b> cIMS validates the measurements performed by the TED device, and reports a trust score to the Identity Provider (IdP). The IdP takes into account the reported trust score when the IdP computes and issues a Level of Assurance (LOA) value to <b>the</b> <b>client</b> platform. In this way the Service Provider obtains a greater degree <b>of</b> assurance that <b>the</b> <b>client’s</b> computing environment is relatively free of unrecognized and/or unauthorized components.|$|R

2500|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to the present, {{the field has}} been marked by a {{diversity}} of approaches that partly reflect the original schools, but which also draw on other theories and methods from individual psychotherapy and elsewhere – these approaches and sources include: brief therapy, structural therapy, constructivist approaches (e.g., Milan systems, post-Milan/collaborative/conversational, reflective), solution-focused therapy, narrative therapy, a range of cognitive and behavioral approaches, psychodynamic and object relations approaches, attachment and Emotionally Focused Therapy, intergenerational approaches, network therapy, and multisystemic therapy (MST).
