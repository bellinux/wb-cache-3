5|$|Zenobia has {{inspired}} scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has {{lingered in the}} West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia {{as a woman who}} created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} {{of the conflict}} provided the pretext for violence between highland Merina and coastal Malagasy of other ethnic groups that were linked to precolonial history and politics. Merina Hova elites founded the MDRM {{not only in the}} interest of ending French rule, but also in regaining the political dominance of the Merina upon independence. In reaction to the founding of the MDRM, in 1946 the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed. It attracted membership from members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Initially a non-nationalist party, PADESM eventually favored a gradual process toward independence that would preserve close ties to France and prevent the reemergence of the precolonial Merina hegemony. The French authorities tacitly supported PADESM, which accused MDRM of launching the uprising to re-establish Merina rule. By aligning itself with PADESM, Socialist-dominated French politicians sought to cast themselves as champions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> masses against the exploitative Hova elites.|$|E

25|$|Gontrand had {{a period}} of intemperance. He was {{eventually}} overcome with remorse {{for the sins of}} his past life, and spent his remaining years repenting of them, both for himself and for his nation. In atonement, he fasted, prayed, wept, and offered himself to God. Throughout the balance of his prosperous reign he attempted to govern by Christian principles. According to St. Gregory of Tours, he was the protector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed,</b> caregiver to the sick, and the tender parent to his subjects. He was generous with his wealth, especially in times of plague and famine. He strictly and justly enforced the law without respect to person, yet was ever ready to forgive offences against himself, including two attempted assassinations. Gontrand munificently built and endowed many churches and monasteries. St. Gregory related that the king performed many miracles both before and after his death, some of which St. Gregory claimed to have witnessed himself.|$|E
25|$|The Estonian {{literary}} tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas The Bard of Viru tried {{to imitate the}} regivärss folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, Western European end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lays {{not so much in}} her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of Imperial Russia, the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in Meie kass (Our Cat) and delicate love poetry, Head ööd (Good Night) to a powerful cri de coeur and rallying call to an oppressed nation, Mu isamaa nad olid matnud (My Country, they have buried you). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes contemporary Irish playwright Brian Friel's dramatization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doubly <b>oppressed</b> Irish female who is victimized {{not only}} by the British colonizer, but also by the Irish men who seek compensation for their own colonized status.

Because of insufficient funds in the continental army, Hinde was forced to cover the costs of inoculations, which [...] "seriously impaired his private fortune".

500|$|Historians {{exhibited}} varying {{responses to}} Blassingame's use of psychological theory. In a {{review in the}} William and Mary Quarterly, George Mullin is especially critical of Blassingame's use of psychology, stating that Blassingame [...] "reduc slave behavior and culture {{to a question of}} roles and psychological characteristics". He concludes that an [...] "E. P. Thompson for the American Black community during slavery is still off-stage", and that the topic needs exploration by a social or economic historian. Rawick states that Blassingame's [...] "first major error lies in adopting the very questionable deterministic social psychological role theories associated with ... Irving Goffman and Henry Stack Sullivan." [...] He complains that it [...] "parodies the basic complexity of the 'psychology' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> who simultaneously view themselves in socially negative terms while struggling against the view of themselves and their behavior". Rawick is convinced that Blassingame would have reached the same conclusions from the sources without the use of psychology [...] "because the historical evidence as seen through an unadulterated commitment to the struggles of the slaves and an equally uncompromising hostility to the masters would have led him there." [...] On the other hand, Eugene D. Genovese and Earl E. Thorpe praised Blassingame for his use of psychological theory, but admit they prefer Freudian and Marxist interpretations over Sullivanian theory.|$|E
500|$|The book {{proved to}} be popular enough to be printed in two more editions and in 1796 Rückerschöld's first genuine {{cookbook}} was published, Den Nya och Fullständiga Kok-Boken ("The New and Complete Cookbook"). It was far larger than her previous work, over 300 pages, and included recipes for more refined dishes. Nevertheless, Rückerschöld tried to hold fast to her frugal ideals. In the foreword to the book, she described Cajsa Wargs cookbook as being too extravagant, though this is partially excused because {{it was written in}} a time of more abundance and by an author used to the lavish resources of a wealthy kitchen. In the book Rückerschöld continued to promote her goal that all women should be skilled homemakers and cooks; without such knowledge, they {{would not be able to}} fulfill their duties as women. Other than recommendations in the foreword, the book also contained a short chapter with descriptions of fictitious housewives that served as warning examples about neglecting housework in favor of beautification, reading, religion, or doing the chores of the servants. The ideal housewife is embodied only by the final example, Beningnia. By being humble, studious and knowledgeable, and being first to rise and last to go to bed, she becomes [...] "the pride of her husband, pinnacle of the household, joy of servants, delight of friends, assuager of the poor, solace of the inconsolable, haven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed,</b> and, finally, the envy of mean-spirited neighbors".|$|E
500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oppressed.</b> Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the importance, {{in the search}} for justice and liberation in Malawi, <b>of</b> reading <b>the</b> bible through <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> women and <b>the</b> <b>oppressed.</b> Serious questions have been raised in Malawian Church and Society concerning the inferiority and subordination <b>of</b> women and <b>the</b> <b>oppressed,</b> particularly <b>the</b> poor and marginalised groups and their role and place in the holy ministry. Since <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian Church in Malawi nearly 130 years ago, women and <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> groups have been discriminated against in various ways. They have not taken an active share and responsibility in the whole community life of society, and have not participated fully and more widely in <b>the</b> various fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church’s structures. The thesis critically challenges <b>the</b> patriarchal reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts which <b>oppresses</b> and marginalises women, and seeks to bring respect and dignity to them by employing a historical critical reading that leads to a liberative reading. Since patriarchal reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts does not bring justice and liberation to women, the thesis engages in a liberative reading that traces and restores women’s history in Mark. Our liberative reading claims that the Christian past is not just a male past where women participated only on the fringes or were not active at all, but it is as well a women’s own past. Hence, <b>the</b> readings <b>of</b> Mark 5 : 24 - 43 & 7 : 24 - 30 provide sufficient indicators for such a history of women as followers of Jesus and leading members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Christian communities. Thus our historical critical reading seeks to transform patriarchal reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts to liberative readings that incorporate all people, men and women, upper and lower classes, different cultures and races, the powerful and the weak...|$|R
