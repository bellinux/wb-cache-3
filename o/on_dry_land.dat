5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. <b>On</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{train for}} each level on a {{seasonal}} schedule {{designed for the}} targeted events: marathon or mid-distance. Additional aspects of training address aerobic (low-intensity) exercise—especially for endurance—and strength to improve joint flexibility and {{to minimize the risk}} of injury. Cross-country ski training occurs throughout the year, including <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> where athletes engage in roller skiing and ski striding to maintain ski-specific muscle fitness.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> sometimes on roller skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E

5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E

5|$|St Anne's Pier is a Victorian era {{pleasure}} pier in the English {{seaside resort}} of St Anne's-on-the-Sea, Lancashire. It {{lies on the}} estuary of the River Ribble. The pier, designed by A. Dowson, was completed in 1885 {{and was one of}} the earliest public buildings in St Anne's, a 19th-century planned town. The pier was originally intended to be a sedate promenading venue for the resort's visitors, but attractions were later added. Changes made to the estuary channels to improve access to Preston Dock left the pier <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> and ended its steamer services to Blackpool and Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often {{alone or in}} a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b> It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
5|$|Mating occurs <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> but {{the females}} {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts can be a very significant part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} prefers more wooded areas than the better-known white stork, and breeds in large marshy {{wetlands}} with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black stork does inhabit more agricultural {{areas in the}} Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Later {{the same}} year, teaser images began {{appearing}} on Cardiacs' website and Facebook group, {{culminating in the}} announcement of the long-awaited next Sea Nymphs album, <b>On</b> the <b>Dry</b> <b>Land,</b> whose songs had been recorded around {{the same time as the}} first album but were left unreleased for over 20 years. The album released on November 2016 in CD and vinyl formats. The completion of <b>On</b> the <b>Dry</b> <b>Land</b> was made possible thanks to a turn for the better in Tim Smith's health; he was able to return to the studio to supervise production and additional recording necessary to the album's completion between 2015-2016. In an interview with Uncut (magazine), Smith revealed that even more Sea Nymphs material beyond <b>On</b> The <b>Dry</b> <b>Land</b> will be released at some point. He also stated that he was [...] "deeply touched" [...] by the efforts of those who had contributed toward the Cardiacs tribute album, Leader of the Starry Skies (the sales of which went directly toward rehabilitating Smith) and that he had since [...] "made a pledge to self to get better".|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies had}} been done about the {{distribution}} of halophytes (Tsuda 1947,Hatanaka 1956,Kuranari and Iwamura 1976, 1977,Iwamura 1987,Nakanishi 1989,Ejima et al. 1990,Takahashi et al. 1991). However, {{there have been a}} few study as to weeds invaded into the <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> after the reclamation (Kobayashi 1952,Jinno and Ida, 1988). Now, 3, 550 ha of a inner part of Isahaya Bay was closed for the reclamation in April 14, 1997. Since water level is kept at - 1 m of sea level standardized at Tokyo Bay, a broad <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> was emerged. As a desalinization was progressed, many spermatophytic plants (glycophytes), so called weeds invaded into the <b>dried</b> <b>land.</b> 14 study sites were set on the dreid land inside the bank, and investigations based on the relation between the flora and soil properties were done from July to August in 1977. Soil salinity was storongly desalinized at the mouth area of river, since soils of habitats was gravelly sand. Clayey soils were also considerably desalinized at sites where fresh water was lifted from a back creek by a lift pump. Then, many weeds grew on such sites. On the other hands, the desalinization of clayey soils near the bank already constructed, where the lift pump was not set, was progressing more slowly. Therefore, since the soil salinity was still considerably high, weeds did not grow except for halophytes, such as Suaeda japonica. Moreover, plants did not grow on reduced soils. 108 plant species including some halophytes were found. Plant species of high emergence rate were Sonchus oleraceus, Eclipata prostrata and Rumex japonicus etc. among plants investigated. Halophytes, especially those of the seashore did not spread so much <b>on</b> <b>dried</b> <b>lands.</b> Hereafter, I would like to study the succession of spermatophytes <b>on</b> <b>dried</b> <b>land</b> insidethe bank...|$|R
5|$|The {{body plan}} {{of an adult}} frog is {{generally}} characterized by a stout body, protruding eyes, cleft tongue, limbs folded underneath, {{and the absence of}} a tail. Besides living in fresh water and <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land,</b> the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. The skins of frog are glandular, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Warty species of frog tend to be called toads but the distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than taxonomy or evolutionary history. Frogs' skins vary in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and warn off predators.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> <b>land</b> {{in the period}} from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
