5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters {{typically}} have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E
25|$|Granulosa cell {{tumors are}} the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and {{juvenile}} granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> from a population of cells that surrounds germinal cells.|$|E
25|$|FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone): {{secreted}} by the pituitary, {{causes the}} <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> to develop. Levels of FSH rise slightly {{at the end}} of estrus, but have their highest peak about 10 days before the next ovulation. FSH is inhibited by inhibin (see below), at the same time LH and estrogen levels rise, which prevents immature follicles from continuing their growth. Mares may however have multiple FSH waves during a single estrous cycle, and diestrus follicles resulting from a diestrus FSH wave are not uncommon, particularly in the height of the natural breeding season.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the experiments presented in this dissertation were to evaluate: (1) dose effects of a synthetic progestin (melengestrol acetate; MGA) on secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and 17 β-estradiol; (2) pattern of ovarian follicular development and concentrations of steroids and activity of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) in follicular fluid of normal and persistent ovarian follicles; and (3) involvement of local regulators in development and regression of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and corpora lutea (CL) in cattle. ^ Synthetic progestins {{have been used to}} synchronize the stage of the estrous cycle in beef cattle, however, acceptable fertility at the synchronized estrus has not been achieved. An increase in pulsatile secretion of LH and greater circulating concentrations of 17 β-estradiol were observed when estrous synchronization treatments were compared to midluteal phase of the estrous cycle. Greater doses of MGA than those typically used in estrous synchrony protocols did not suppress LH and 17 β-estradiol to the same extent as progesterone from CL. Greater pulsatile secretion of LH resulting from use of estrous synchrony treatments induces development of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> which may compromise fertility in cattle. Persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> have greater concentrations of 17 β-estradiol and less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid than normally growing <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> Therefore, greater LH pulse frequency and possibly less activity of IGFBPs in follicular fluid may facilitate the growth of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and reduce fertility in cattle. Local regulators in the ovary may regulate development and regression of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and CL. Fas antigen (cell death inducer) mRNA was present in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and CL. Amounts of Fas antigen mRNA were greater in atretic <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and regressing CL compared with healthy <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and functional CL from cattle. Research presented herein provides basic information that enhances our understanding of mechanisms underlying ovarian follicular development and subsequent ovulation of a viable oocyte, and the formation of a functional corpus luteum and successful pregnancy in cattle. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{doses of}} {{progestin}} used commercially are administered to synchronize {{the stage of}} the estrous cycle among bovine females, fertility is reduced compared with that of untreated controls. The reduced fertility that results from the use of progestinbased estrus synchrony regimens is associated with the development of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> Persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> develop {{as a result of the}} greater frequency of LH pulses that occurs during the period of treatment with progestins. The greater release of LH pulses results in enhanced secretion of 17 β-estradiol from persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> The greater frequency of LH release or the greater secretion of 17 β-estradiol associated with development of persistent <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> probably contributes to the reduced fertility that occurs when progestins are used to synchronize stage of the estrous cycle...|$|R

25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method {{is the ability to}} expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her estrous cycle. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E
500|$|In a study, {{the blood}} serum of female addax was {{analyzed}} through immunoassay {{to know about}} their luteal phase. Estrous cycle duration was of about 33 days. During pregnancy, ultrasonography showed the uterine horns as coiled. The maximum diameters of the <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> and the corpus luteum were [...] and [...] Each female underwent an anovulatory period lasting 39 to 131 days, during {{which there was no}} ovulation. Anovulation was rare in winter, which suggested the effect of seasons on the estrous cycle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{ovulation}} {{is controlled by}} the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). [...] In the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, the <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicle</b> will undergo a series of transformations called [...] cumulus expansion, which is stimulated by FSH. After this is done, a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle, and the secondary oocyte will leave the [...] follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the [...] amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase, the secondary oocyte will travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus. If fertilized by a sperm, the fertilized secondary oocyte or ovum may implant there 6–12 days [...] later.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effects of green tea {{infusion}} on the toxicity of ovaries of female rats treated with the contraceptive depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). Material and Methods: A total of twenty-four female rats were randomly divided into four groups, incuding the control group (no treatment), the DMPA-treated group and the group treated with DMPA and infusion of green tea at various doses (165 and 330 mg/gram of body weight per day). The number of granulosa cells, the number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> and the size of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> were subjected to histopathological analysis. Results: The number of granulosa cells did not differ significantly among the study groups. The number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> was significantly higher in the DMPA-treated group than that of the control group. Of doses of 165 and 330 mg/g of body weight of green tea administration, only the low dose decreased the number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> significantly relative to the DMPA-treated group, although it has not yet reached the levels comparable to those of the control group. The size of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> did not differ significantly among the study groups. Conclusion: DMPA led to an increased number of <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles,</b> which was restored by infusion of low doses of green tea. Thus, green tea constitutes an herb that can be combined with administration of DMPA and useful in inhibiting the adverse effects of contraceptives.

40|$|Background: Resistin {{was first}} {{reported}} to be an adipocyte-specific hormone, but recent studies have indicated a connection between resistin and reproductive function. However, {{it is not yet}} known if resistin is expressed by the ovary and if it can affect steroidogenesis in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> from prepubertal pigs. Methods: In this study, using real time PCR, immunoblotting, and ELISA, we quantified resistin expression and concentration in maturing <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> (small, 3 – 4 mm; medium, 4 – 5 mm; large, 6 – 7 mm) collected from prepubertal pigs. In addition, the dose-responsive effects of recombinant human resistin (0. 1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) on steroid hormone (i. e., progesterone [P 4], androstendione [A 4], testosterone [T], and estradiol [E 2]) secretion in culture medium and steroidogenic enzyme (i. e., CYP 11 A 1, 3 betaHSD, CYP 17 A 1, 17 betaHSD, and CYP 19 A 1) expression in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> were determined. Results: We observed that resistin gene and protein expression increased significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) during follicular growth, with large follicles expressing the highest level of this adipokine. Recombinant resistin also increased P 4, A 4, and T secretion by up-regulating the steady state levels of CYP 11 A 1, 3 betaHSD, CYP 17 A 1, and 17 betaHSD. Recombinant resistin had no effects on E 2 secretion and CYP 19 A 1 expression in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles.</b> Conclusion: Our results show resistin expression in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> from prepubertal pigs for the first time. We also show that recombinant resistin stimulates steroidogenesis in <b>ovarian</b> <b>follicles</b> by increasing the expression of CYP 11 A 1, 3 betaHSD, CYP 17 A 1, and 17 betaHSD. The presence of resistin in the porcine ovary and its direct effects on steroidogenesis suggest that resistin is a new regulator of ovary function in prepubertal animals...|$|R
