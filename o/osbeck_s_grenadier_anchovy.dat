50|$|The goldspotted <b>grenadier</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Coilia dussumieri) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the family Engraulidae. It is found in coastal waters and {{estuaries}} in the tropical western Indo-Pacific region.|$|R
5000|$|Coilia, the <b>Grenadier</b> <b>anchovies,</b> is a genus of anchovies. It {{currently}} contains 12-13 species.It derives its {{generic name}} coilio from the Greek koilia, meaning [...] "hollow" [...] or [...] "abdomen".|$|R
50|$|Coilia nasus, {{also known}} as the Japanese <b>grenadier</b> <b>anchovy,</b> is a fish from the family Engraulidae (anchovies). It grows to 41 cm total length; it is a {{relatively}} large species for its genus. It is found in marine, freshwater, and brackish water at depths down to 50 m. It is anadromous, moving to freshwater to spawn. It is distributed in the northwest Pacific, between 21-42°N and 109-134°E, or from Guangdong in China to the Ariake Sound in southwestern Japan.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the taxonomic status of the Ariake Sea population of Japanese <b>grenadier</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Coilia nasus, and assess the contemporary possible genetic barrier {{between the west and}} east coastal waters of the East China Sea, we used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to detect the genetic structure of C. nasus, in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea. Eighty-one individuals of C. nasus were collected from five locations and 12 individuals of Coilia mystus were sampled from the Yangtze River Estuary. A total of 371 loci were detected by five primer combinations, 310 of which were polymorphic (83. 56 %). Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) and pairwise fixation index (FST) revealed significant genetic differentiation among five samples, indicating limited gene flow among populations. The dendrogram for populations by neighbor-joining (NJ) cluster analysis provided evidence of a clear relationship between genetic and geographic patterns, supporting significant genetic differentiation between China coastal populations and Ariake Sea populations. Compared to the genetic divergence between C. nasus and C. mystus, the level of genetic differentiation between China and the Ariake Sea populations of C. nasus is obvious below the species level, indicating isolated populations of C. nasu...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coilia nasus (Japanese <b>grenadier</b> <b>anchovy)</b> {{undergoes}} {{spawning migration}} {{from the ocean}} to fresh water inland. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} anadromous fish use olfactory cues to perform successful migration to spawn. However, limited genomic information is available for C. nasus. To understand the molecular mechanisms of spawning migration, it is essential to identify the genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior of C. nasus. Results: Using de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly, we constructed two transcriptomes of the olfactory epithelium from wild anadromous and non-anadromous C. nasus. Over 178 million high-quality clean reads were generated using Illumina sequencing technology and assembled into 176, 510 unigenes (mean length: 843 bp). About 51 % (89, 456) of the unigenes were functionally annotated using protein databases. Gene ontology analysis of the transcriptomes indicated gene enrichment not only in signal detection and transduction, but also in regulation and enzymatic activity. The potential genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior were identified. In addition, simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed to identify potential molecular markers. Conclusion: We, for the first time, obtained high-quality de novo transcriptomes of C. nasus using a high-throughput sequencing approach. Our study lays the foundation for further investigation of C. nasus spawning migration and genome evolution...|$|R

Compared to the genetic divergence between C. nasus and C. mystus, the level of genetic differentiation between China and the Ariake Sea populations of C. nasus is obvious below the species level, indicating isolated populations of C. nasus in the Ariake Sea. Isolation by distance analysis revealed that direct ocean distance with deep-water at the continental slope and high salinity between west and east coastal waters of the East China Sea served as major physical barrier to C. nasus, supporting the coastal dispersal pattern in this estuarine species, and rejecting offshore dispersal strategy...|$|R
40|$|Bortom trawl {{data from}} the depth {{interval}} 300 - 2050 m on the slope off Norway were analysed to study distribution of fish biomass and the associated species assemblages. It is hypothesised that the pronounced hydrographic front between the warm Atlantic Waterrnass and the cold Norwegian Sea Deep-water, combined with a declining food supply with depth and distance from the shelf, structure the assemblages on the continental slope of the eastem Nmwegian Sea. From a high level at the shelf edge and upper slope, the fish biomass declined abruptly at about 720 m when crossing the 0 "C-isotherm associated with the hydrographic front. Beneath the frontal zone, the fish biornass was only 11 % of that above it and decreased further with increasing depth. In upper slope waters, the fish biornass increased with increasing latitude. Arctic species such as Lycodes frigidus and Paraliparis bathybius were dominant in the deep cold slope waters. The high fish biomass associated with the steep temperature gradient at 600 - 720 m was rnainly attributable to a few large and/or abundant boreo-arctic species, i. e. Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, redfishes Sebastes mentella and <b>S.</b> marinus, roughhead <b>grenadier</b> Macrourus berglax, and Raja hyperborea. In the shallower and warrner upper slope waters a species assemblage occurred which resembled that associated with adjacent deep shelf areas strongly influenced by the Atlantic Watermass...|$|R
