Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.

5|$|After {{recovering}} from his injury, Serevi was {{named in the}} Fiji sevens squad in January 2004. This was despite a rule enforced by coach Senivalati Laulau that to be eligible to play, one must attend the team's trials. After being named in the training squad, Serevi was not selected for the squad for the Wellington <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> legs of the IRB World Sevens Series. He then missed selection for the team to play in Hong Kong {{for the second year}} in a row. Pauliasi Tabulutu replaced Laulau as Fiji's coach and recalled Serevi to play in the Bordeaux Sevens. Serevi then played in the London leg of the Sevens Series – his last leg of the year.|$|E
5|$|Production {{originated}} at {{the studios}} of PBS affiliate WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. WHYY offered Nickelodeon their newly opened production wing to use, and Nickelodeon felt Philadelphia was a better location to initially produce Double Dare because of its lower production costs, instead of cities like New York <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> where national television production is more common. The 65-episode first season was recorded in a 23-day period beginning September 18, 1986. Double Dare premiered on Nickelodeon on October 6, 1986. New episodes aired weekdays at 5:30p.m. ET during the original series' run on Nickelodeon. After {{the success of the}} first 65 episodes, a second 65-episode season was ordered.|$|E

25|$|In , ABC {{returned}} to baseball broadcasting {{with a series}} of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.|$|E
25|$|While not {{on or near}} any {{fault line}} like San Francisco <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> Mexico City is {{vulnerable}} to earthquakes. The main {{reason for this is}} the surface geology of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in response to major flooding. The near surface geology of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area.|$|E
25|$|Atlanta-based OutKast proved one of {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} Hip-Hop groups from outside of New York City <b>or</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> In the 1990s and 2000s, Atlanta emerged as the leading center of urban music. Artists like TLC, Usher, 112, T.I., Ludacris, YoungBloodZ, OutKast, Goodie Mob (as well as the Dungeon Family music collective of which both are members), and producers like Organized Noize, L.A. Reid, and Jermaine Dupri, the later of whom founded the successful record labels LaFace and SoSo Def, have blurred musical boundaries by blending R singing with Hip-Hop production. More recently, Atlanta is also known as a center of crunk music, an electric bass-driven club music, whose most visible practitioner has been Atlanta-based producer/hype man/rapper Lil Jon. Before moving to Atlanta, Young Jeezy lived in Macon, Georgia.|$|E
