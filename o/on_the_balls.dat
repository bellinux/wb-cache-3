Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

5000|$|A {{much earlier}} song, <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ball,</b> was sung at Manawatu games during its {{foundation}} years and beyond. According to Manawatu rugby historian, Clive Akers, it was composed in Palmerston North by team captain Ted Secker and was 'made famous by the 1888 Native team that toured Britain'. Akers said further 'it would rate as Manawatu's greatest {{contribution to the}} rugby world'. Its chorus went: [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Ball!</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ball!</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ball!</b> Thro' scrummage, three-quarters and all, sticking together we keep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leather, and shout as we go, <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Ball!" ...|$|R

25|$|Carved Stone Balls {{found at}} various sites in Scotland, {{northern}} England and north eastern Ireland. Spirals and rings of concentric circles carved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> {{can be found}} on standing stones and megalithic structures of the same period. Sites such as Maughanby Circle and Newgrange were designed to monitor the movements of the sun with special emphasis on the winter solstice. The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look upon today as religious. No written records exist for the Neolithic people of Britain and Ireland. From reading the archaeology it has not been possible to determine whether these peoples understood the concept of a ball game. However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including Christmastide which coincides with Yuletide, the winter solstice and the Pagan rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out.|$|E
2500|$|In Highland dancing, {{the dancers}} dance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> {{of the feet}} [...] Highland dancing {{is a form of}} solo step dancing, from which it evolved, but while some forms of step dancing are purely percussive in nature, Highland dancing {{involves}} not only a combination of steps but also some integral upper body, arm, and hand movements.|$|E
2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles with every step, stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> of the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel {{is closer to the}} front, more solidly under the ankle, where the toe box provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the toe box or crushed into the front of the toe box.|$|E

2500|$|Insular {{brooches}} {{had been}} taken back to Scandinavia, and began to be produced there in the 10th century for wearing singly by men at the shoulder; Viking women wore pairs of characteristic oval brooches on the upper breast. Most were simpler than Insular examples, and several hundred examples in [...] "tinned bronze rather than silver" [...] are known. [...] The 10th century Danish Møllerløkken Brooch is the most elaborate example known, with a simple overall design with ball terminals and pin-head, but with rich detailing such as interlace panels on the ring and filigree sections <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls.</b> [...] Other Insular types were also produced in Viking areas of England, especially Scandinavian York. The penannular brooch fell from common use {{by the end of}} the 11th century, a time when Ireland and Scotland, and Scandinavia, were adopting general Western European styles in many areas of both art and life.|$|E
