40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the ability of {{students}} to appreciate the extent of their own knowledge is essential to enable them to appreciate where gaps may exist and prompt the development of remedial learning strategies. This article reports on a study investigating this capability in which 307 business undergraduates provided 7525 judgements on the state of their own knowledge in respect of issues addressed in their study programme. The findings indicated a general tendency for <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowledge,</b> which was more evident in those studying on the first year of their degree programme than students in their second year. These findings suggest that effective learning may be hampered by students’ ignorance of gaps in their knowledge, particularly {{in the early stages of}} academic programmes, and that they may benefit from interventions to assist them in developing a better appreciation of their current state of knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Research on people’s {{confidence}} in their general knowledge has to date produced two fairly stable effects, many inconsistent results, and no comprehensive theory. We propose such a comprehensive framework, the theory of probabilistic mental models (PMM theory). The theory (a) explains both the overconfidence effect (mean confidence is higher than percentage of answers correct) and the hard-easy effect (over{{confidence in}}creases with item difficulty) {{reported in the literature}} and (b) predicts conditions under which both effects appear, disappear, or invert. In addition, (c) it predicts a new phenomenon, the confidence-frequency effect, a systematic difference between a judgment of confidence in a single event (i. e., that any given answer is correct) and a judgment of the frequency of correct answers in the long run. Two experiments are reported that support PMM theory by confirming these predictions, and several apparent anomalies reported in the literature are explained and integrated into the present framework. Do people think they know more than they really do? In the last 15 years, cognitive psychologists have amassed a large and apparently damning body of experimental evidence on <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowledge,</b> evidence that is in turn part of an even larger and more damning literature on socalled cognitive biases. The cognitive bias research claims that people are naturally prone to making mistakes in reasoning and memory, including the mistake of overestimating their knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{transactions}} sometimes {{occur in}} an environment where third-party enforcement is lacking. Behavioral explanations typically allude to the social preferences, where an individual’s utility is directly affected by another’s outcome, as the driver of the trusting investments and reciprocal returns. We hypothesize that, in part, these decisions are determined by an individual’s financial literacy. Experimental evidence is coupled with an innovative financial literacy assessment, which measures general competence, numeracy skills, and <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> one’s <b>knowledge.</b> Results indicate that overconfidence is a significant determinant of behavior. Specifically, overconfident individuals make larger contributions in the investment game.

It does not inoculate investors from persuasion or social engineering tactics used by offenders to secure investment in fraudulent schemes. In fact, recent research indicates that <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> investment <b>knowledge</b> may make individuals more susceptible to fraud. Using boiler room fraud as a case study, this article introduces the PREY (Profiled, Relational, Exploitable and Yielding) model to capture the psychological tactics used by fraud perpetrators to influence the thoughts and decisionmaking processes of individuals. The PREY model operationalizes the tenets of social engineering and demonstrates how such tactics could be re-engineered to increase the effectiveness of fraud prevention within the financial literacy context.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{schizophrenia}} show <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> {{memory and}} social cognition errors. The present investigation examined whether this cognitive distortion also manifests in perceptual tasks. Methods: A total of 55 individuals with schizophrenia, 58 with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) {{as well as}} 45 non-clinical controls were presented 24 blurry black and white pictures, half of which contained a hidden object; the other half contained (“snowy”) visual noise. Participants had to judge whether the pictures depicted an object or not and how confident they were in this judgment. Results: Participants with schizophrenia showed <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors and an enhanced knowledge corruption index (i. e. rate of high-confident errors on all high-confident responses) relative to both control groups. In contrast, accuracy scores did not differ between clinical groups. Metacognitive parameters were correlated with self-rated levels of current paranoia. Discussion: To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors among individuals with psychosis using a visual perception task. Speaking to the specificity of this abnormality for schizophrenia and its pathogenetic relevance, <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors and <b>knowledge</b> corruption were elevated in patients with schizophrenia relative to both control groups and were correlated with paranoia...|$|R
40|$|People {{feel they}} {{understand}} complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth {{than they really}} do; {{they are subject to}} an illusion—an illusion of explanatory depth. The illusion is far stronger for explanatory knowledge than many other kinds of knowledge, such as that for facts, procedures or narratives. The illusion for explanatory knowledge is most robust where the environment supports real-time explanations with visible mechanisms. We demonstrate the illusion of depth with explanatory <b>knowledge</b> <b>in</b> Studies 1 – 6. Then we show differences <b>in</b> <b>overconfidence</b> about <b>knowledge</b> across different <b>knowledge</b> domains <b>in</b> Studies 7 – 10. Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> Studies 11 and 12, and discuss the implications of our findings for the roles of intuitive theories in concepts and cognition...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} {{relation between}} overconfidence and investment provision has been theoretically justified and practically assumed in the literature, {{but has not}} been thoroughly investigated. We test and confirm this positive relation between direct measures of <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> one's financial <b>knowledge</b> and choice of investment. More precisely, strong <b>overconfidence</b> results <b>in</b> excess investment, underconfidence induces underinvestment, whereas moderate overconfidence leads to accurate investments. Our experimental results are based on different subject pools, financial professionals and students, and different media: computer-, paper-, and web-based. The degree of one's overestimation of one's individual financial knowledge relative to one's actual knowledge as well as relative to the knowledge of peers explains investment decisions better than one's actual knowledge. The relation between overconfidence and investment is robust {{to the degree of}} individual risk aversion, the riskiness of the investment projects, and to the changes in incentives structure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the relationship (termed overconfidence) between subjective confidence in judgements and objective reality, to determine and clarify {{the nature of}} influencing factors. Chapter 1 examines whether predictions of future behaviour for oneself are less overconfident than those for a partner. Chapter 2 studies the influence of base rates and the desirability of the outcome on <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> behavioural predictions, and whether people can accurately estimate population base rates. Chapters 3 and 4 then progress to ask whether individual characteristics (such as field dependence, probabilistic reasoning ability, and self-esteem) of the person making the judgements are related to <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> general <b>knowledge</b> tasks and behavioural predictions. Chapter 5 investigates whether feedback can affect overconfidence. A questionnaire based methodology was used. The results indicated that overconfidence is strongly related to task difficulty, which varies according to the person being predicted for and the base rate. It was found that predictions about another person were more overconfident than predictions for oneself. It was also shown that maximum overconfidence occurred at mid base rates with underconfidence at extreme base rates. Higher <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> predictions was found for events which were positive in outcome than those with negative outcomes. Large variations <b>in</b> individuals’ overall <b>overconfidence</b> occurred, but no evidence was found to link this with the individual differences studied. Finally, feedback did not reduce overconfidence on average, but did reduce overconfidence over time for consistently hard questions, but not for easy questions. Issues raised by this thesis are examined in the Discussion...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{consistently}} observed that people are generally overconfident in their judgments or decisions and that <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> general <b>knowledge</b> is typically stronger among Asian than among Western subject groups. However, scientists, {{whose job is to}} produce neutral and objective knowledge, are expected to be immune to overconfidence and to be independent of cross-cultural variation. The authors conducted an email survey to determine whether well-trained scholars are really immune to the overconfidence bias and whether cross-cultural variations <b>in</b> <b>overconfidence</b> exist among scientists from different language backgrounds. Contrary to the authors&# 39; expectations, scientists who published their works in Science or Nature were inaccurate, overconfident, likely to nominate the journal they published in to have a greater impact factor, and easier to generate supportive rather than opposite arguments for their own conclusions. The authors also found that Chinese-speaking authors exhibited greater overconfidence but generated fewer arguments than did their English-speaking counterparts, which is consistent with Yates, Lee, and Shinotsuka&# 39;s argument recruitment model. The pervasive overconfidence and its cross-cultural variations suggest that an academic author may not communicate his or her conclusions to readers in an impartial and value-free manner, and therefore, the job of detecting bias is hoped to be taken and done well by the reader...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{how and why}} men {{and women}} are {{different}} in their confidence levels. Using the data of the PISA test in math, confidence is decomposed into two dimensions: confidence <b>in</b> correct math <b>knowledge</b> and <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> over-claiming false <b>knowledge.</b> The findings highlight that female students are not less confident than male students, but they are rather less overconfident. Furthermore, mathematical abilities have different effects on male and female students. While ability alone increases confidence and decreases overconfidence, the interaction effect of feminine gender and ability is negative. This means that the negative effect of ability on overconfidence is larger for female students than male ones, while the positive effect of ability on confidence is smaller for females. That being said, the negative gender gap <b>in</b> <b>overconfidence</b> against girls is greater for students in the higher quartiles of math scores than those in the lower quartiles. Also, the positive gender gap in confidence for girls is smaller for well-performing students than underperforming ones. The empirical evidence further reveals that such gender-asymmetric effects of ability can be explained by gender socialization that limits women's roles and undermines their achievements...|$|R
40|$|Background. This paper's {{starting}} point is the recognition (descriptive not normative) that, {{for the vast majority}} of day-to-day clinical decision-making situations, the 'evidence' for decision-making is experiential knowledge. Moreover, reliance on this knowledge base means that nurses must use cognitive shortcuts or heuristics for handling information when making decisions. These heuristics encourage systematic biases in decision-makers and deviations from the normative rules of 'good' decision-making. Aims. The aim of the paper is to explore three common heuristics and the biases that arise when handling complex information <b>in</b> clinical decision-making (<b>overconfidence,</b> hindsight and base rate neglect) and, in response to these biases, to illustrate some simple techniques for reducing the negative influence of heuristics. Discussion. Nurses face a limited range of types of uncertainty in their clinical decisions and draw primarily on experiential knowledge to handle these uncertainties. This paper argues that experiential knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient basis for clinical decision-making. It illustrates how <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> one's <b>knowledge</b> base, being correct 'after the event' or with the benefit of hindsight, and ignoring the base rates associated with events, conditions or health states, can impact on professional judgements and decisions. The paper illustrates some simple strategies for minimizing the impact of heuristics on the real-life clinical decisions of nurses. Conclusion. The paper concludes that more research knowledge of the impact of heuristics and techniques to combat them in nursing decisions is needed...|$|R

40|$|An {{appreciation}} {{of the extent of}} one's own knowledge is known as metaknowledge and {{it has been argued that}} students' ability to distinguish between what they know, and what they do not, is an important influence on academic success. However, previous research suggests a general tendency for individuals to display <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> their <b>knowledge,</b> by overestimating how much they know. This study assessed the ability of learners studying business in higher education to appreciate the extent of their own knowledge and investigated the association between this capability and academic achievement. It therefore contributes towards answering broader questions regarding how well individuals are able to assess their own capabilities and what the implications of this are. Quantitative methodology was employed and multiple-choice tests used to investigate how accurately students were able to assess the extent of their knowledge of issues addressed in their study programmes. Analysis of over 12, 500 judgements provided by 508 respondents revealed a general tendency for overconfidence and indicated that this was greater for males, older participants and particularly, for Chinese students. Consequently, interventions designed to moderate overconfidence may be particularly valuable for these sub-groups. In terms of its potential implications for learning, the research indicated that better metaknowledge was positively associated with higher levels of academic performance, particularly for those in their first year studying at the university. Consequently, while metacognitive skills, such as accurate self-monitoring, are typically poorly addressed in business schools, the findings from this study suggest that initiatives to improve self monitoring accuracy may be effective in enhancing student learning. Additionally, such interventions have other potential benefits for learners, since metacognitive monitoring skills may also usefully inform lifestyle decisions, as well as improving the chances of success in business and may therefore be particularly beneficial for business students...|$|R

40|$|Experiments in psychology, where {{subjects}} estimate {{confidence intervals}} {{to a series}} of factual questions, have shown that individuals report far too narrow intervals. This has been interpreted as evidence of <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> the preciseness of knowledge, a potentially serious violation of the rationality assumption in economics. Following these results a growing literature in economics has incorporated <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> models of, for instance, financial markets. In this paper we investigate the robustness of results from confidence interval estimation tasks with respect to a number of manipulations: frequency assessments, peer frequency assessments, iteration, and monetary incentives. Our results suggest that a large share of the <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> interval estimation tasks is an artifact of the response format. Using frequencies and monetary incentives reduces the measured <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> the confidence interval method by about 65 %. The results are consistent with the notion that subjects have a deep aversion to setting broad confidence intervals, a reluctance that we attribute to a socially rational trade-off between informativeness and accuracy. overconfidence; uncertainty; monetary incentives; experiments...|$|R

Our numerous predictions find strong support in these data. In particular, we document that overconfidence is a substantively and statistically important predictor of ideological extremeness, voter turnout, and partisan identification...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: <b>Overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors is a well-replicated {{cognitive}} bias in psychosis. However, {{prior studies}} have sometimes {{failed to find}} differences between patients and controls for more difficult tasks. We pursued the hypothesis that <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors is exaggerated in participants with a liability to psychosis relative to controls only when they feel competent in the respective topic and/or deem the question easy. Whereas subjective competence likely enhances confidence in those with low psychosis liability as well, we still expected to find more 'residual' caution in the latter group. Methods: We adopted a psychometric high-risk approach to circumvent the confounding influence of treatment. A total of 2321 individuals {{from the general population}} were administered a task modeled after the "Who wants to be a millionaire" quiz. Participants were requested to endorse one out of four response options, graded for confidence, and were asked to provide ratings regarding subjective competence for the knowledge domain as well as the subjective difficulty of each item. Results: In line with our assumption, <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors was increased overall in participants scoring high on the Paranoia Checklist core paranoia subscale (2 SD above the mean). This pattern of results was particularly prominent for items for which participants considered themselves competent and which they rated as easy. Limitations: Results need to be replicated in a clinical sample. Discussion: In support of our hypothesis, subjective competence and task difficulty moderate <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> errors in psychosis. Trainings that teach patients the fallibility of human cognition may help reduce delusional ideation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

We explore how preference certainty and overconfidence impact the option value to revise today’s {{decisions in the}} future. We design a laboratory experiment that creates a controlled choice environment, in which a subject's choice set (over food snacks) is known and constant over time, and the time frame is short [...] subjects make choices for themselves today, and for one to two weeks ahead. Our results suggest that even for such a seemingly straightforward choice task, only 45 percent of subjects can predict future choices accurately, while stated certainty of future preferences (one and two weeks ahead) is around 80 percent. We define <b>overconfidence</b> <b>in</b> predicting future preferences as: the difference between actual accuracy at predicting future choices and stated certainty of future preferences. Our results suggest strong evidence of overconfidence. We find that overconfidence increases {{with the level of}} stated certainty of future preferences.
