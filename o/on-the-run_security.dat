50|$|When a new {{security}} is issued, becoming the new <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security,</b> buying the new contract and selling {{the old one}} is called rolling the contract.|$|E
50|$|One may roll a {{contract}} because {{one has a}} special preference for a specific maturity—for example, the five-year CDS rate of a given name—or because a given <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security</b> is more liquid than off-the-run securities.|$|E
50|$|United States Treasury {{securities}} have periodic auctions; {{the treasury}} {{of a given}} tenor, say 30 years, which has most recently been auctioned is the <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security,</b> while all older treasuries of that tenor are off-the-run.|$|E
40|$|We {{characterize}} the microstructure {{of the market}} for Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) using novel tick data from the interdealer market. We find a marked difference in trading activity between <b>on-the-run</b> and off-the-run <b>securities,</b> as in the nominal Treasury securities market. We find little difference in bid-ask spreads or quoted depth between <b>on-the-run</b> and off-the-run <b>securities,</b> in contrast to the nominal market, but we do find a sharp difference in the incidence of posted quotes. Intraday activity differs strikingly from the nominal market, with activity peaking in the mid-to-late morning. Announcement effects also differ from the nominal market, with auction results and consumer price index announcements eliciting particularly sharp increases in trading activity.

40|$|Although its importance, only {{recently}} {{the issue of}} liquidity in Treasury markets has received greater attention. We survey the literature about market liquidity and liquidity measures, and we put forward new measures. The aim {{is to provide a}} description of the liquidity of the Italian wholesale secondary market, which we describe thoroughly. We apply a large set of measures on a unique dataset, which gives us a complete view of the market. Even though the market provides an amount of liquidity that fits the market needs, the quality of the order book is low, and despite the presence {{of a large number of}} market makers, the degree of competition among them is not very high. Moreover, no clear and general relationship emerges between trading and order book measures. Indeed, even though trading activity is higher for <b>on-the-run</b> <b>securities</b> with respect to the off-the-run securities, there is not a sharp difference in terms of liquidity of the order book between them. In this case market regulation plays an important role. Finally, we investigate how long it takes for a new issue to become the benchmark for its segment. Our evidence shows that some modifications of the issuance policy in order to have a larger outstanding since the first auction could help securities in gaining earlier their benchmark status, especially in case of 10 -year BTPs. ginebri@unimol. i...|$|R
40|$|Transactions {{involving}} {{repurchase agreements}} (known as repos and reverses) are important tools the Federal Reserve uses in implementing monetary policy. By undertaking such transactions with primary dealers, the Fed can temporarily {{increase or decrease}} the quantity of reserves in the banking system. The {{focus of this article}} is the repo market, especially the role the market plays in the financing and hedging activities of primary dealers. The author explains the close relation between the price premium that newly auctioned, or <b>on-the-run,</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> command and the special repo rates on those securities. The author's analysis demonstrates that the rents that can be earned from special repo rates are capitalized into the price of the underlying bond so as to keep the equilibrium rate of return unchanged.; The discussion begins with a description of repos and reverses, the difference between <b>on-the-run</b> and older <b>securities,</b> and the ways dealers use repos to finance and hedge. The article then examines the difference between general and specific collateral, defines the repo spread and dividend, presents a framework for determining the equilibrium repo spread, and describes the average pattern of overnight repo spreads over the auction cycle. Finally, the article discusses convergence trades and repo squeezes. Two appendixes provide detailed analysis. Repurchase agreements; Government securities...|$|R
50|$|While holding US Treasuries, one {{may wish}} to hold only the most {{recently}} issued security of a given maturity, the so-called <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security.</b> Thus, if one has purchased the on-the-run 30-year treasury and a new 30-year auction occurs, one may sell the old treasury, which is now off-the-run, and purchase the new on-the-run treasury.|$|E
40|$|We analyze price {{discovery}} in the interdealer market for U. S. Treasury securities during stressful days in autumn 1998. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) had found itself with losing short positions in on-therun Treasury securities, and yields on these securities were particularly volatile. Trading activity was intense, with durations between transactions shorter than usual. Using tick-by-tick data on interdealer transactions in the on-the-run twoyear, five-year, and ten-year notes, {{we find that}} during such periods of intense trading, the effect of trade flows on price movements became stronger, a phenomenon Dufour and Engle (2000) have documented for the stock market. We also find that during times of stress, depth was asymmetric between buy and sell sides, and this asymmetry affected the importance of trade flows for price movements. Moreover, market-makers seemed exceptionally reluctant to take risks. After identifying ten particularly stressful days for each <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security,</b> {{we find that the}} effect of trad...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of liquidity and price differentials between on-the-run and off-the-run U. S. Treasury bond markets. To guide our analysis, we develop a parsimonious model of multi-asset speculative trading in which endowment shocks separate the <b>on-the-run</b> <b>security</b> from an otherwise identical off-the-run security. We then explore the equilibrium implications of these shocks on both off/on-the-run price and liquidity differentials {{in the presence of}} two realistic market frictions - information heterogeneity and imperfect competition among informed traders - and a public signal. We test these implications by analyzing daily differences in market liquidity and yields for on-the-run and off-the-run three-month, six-month, and one-year U. S. Treasury bills and two-year, five-year, and ten-year U. S. Treasury notes. Our evidence suggests that i) off/on-the-run bid-ask spread differentials are economically and statistically significant, even after controlling for differences in several of the bonds' intrinsic characteristics (such as duration, convexity, or repo rates); ii) their corresponding yield differentials are neither, inconsistent with the illiquidity premium hypothesis; and iii) off/on-the-run liquidity differentials are larger for bonds of shorter maturity, immediately following bond auction dates, when the uncertainty surrounding the ensuing auction allocations is high, when the dispersion of beliefs across informed traders is high, and when macroeconomic announcements are noisy, consistent with our stylized model...|$|E
40|$|The most {{recently}} issued, on-the-run, Treasuries are extremely liquid and frequently trade {{at a premium}} in both the cash and repo, or financing, markets. Previous research suggests that both the cash and repo premiums reflect demand from buy-and-hold investors who value the superior liquidity of these securities and are reluctant to lend them in the repo market. We find evidence that premiums in the repo market are also closely related to market participants' demand to hedge interest rate risk associated with their holdings of fixed income <b>securities.</b> <b>On-the-run</b> Treasuries Short-selling Liquidity Repo specials Repurchase agreements...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{outright}} (i. e., permanent) Open Market Operations (POMOs) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) on the microstructure of the secondary U. S. Treasury market. POMOs are trades in U. S. Treasury securities aimed at accomplishing the Federal Reserve???s target level of the federal funds rate. Our analysis is motivated by a parsimonious model of speculative trading {{in the presence of}} a stylized Central Bank targeting the price of the traded asset. Contrary to previous studies of government intervention in financial markets, we show that such trading activity improves equilibrium market liquidity, and that the magnitude of this effect is sensitive to the market???s information environment. We test these implications by analyzing a novel sample of intraday U. S. Treasury bond price quotes (from BrokerTec) and a proprietary dataset of all POMOs conducted by the FRBNY between 2001 and 2007. Our evidence suggests that i) bid-ask spreads of <b>on-the-run</b> Treasury <b>securities</b> decline on days when POMOs are executed; and ii) POMOs??? positive liquidity externalities are increasing in proxies for information heterogeneity among speculators, fundamental volatility, and policy uncertainty, consistent with our model. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a comprehensive}} set of liquidity measures for the U. S. Treasury market. The measures are analyzed relative to one another, across securities, and over time. I find highly significant price impact coefficients, such that a simple model that explains price changes with net order flow produces an R 2 statistic above 30 {{percent for the}} two-year note. The price impact coefficients are highly correlated with bid-ask spreads and with episodes of reported poor liquidity (such as the fall 1998 financial markets turmoil). Quote and trade sizes correlate modestly with these episodes {{and with the other}} liquidity measures, as do yield spreads between <b>on-the-run</b> and off-the-run <b>securities.</b> In contrast, trading volume and trading frequency are only weakly correlated with these other measures, suggesting that they are poor liquidity proxies. The various measures are positively correlated across securities, almost without exception, especially for Treasury notes...|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{examines}} the price differences between very liquid <b>on-the-run</b> US Treasury <b>securities</b> and less liquid off-the-run securities {{over the entire}} on/off cycle. Unlike previous studies, by comparing pairs of securities as their relative liquidity varies over time, we can disregard any cross-sectional differences between the securities. Also, since the liquidity of Treasury notes varies predictably over time {{we are able to}} distinguish between current liquidity and expected future liquidity. We show that the more liquid security is priced higher on average, but that this difference depends on the amount of expected future liquidity over its remaining lifetime rather than its current liquidity. We measure future liquidity using both quotes and trades. The liquidity measures include bid-ask spread, depth and trading activity. Examining a variety of liquidity measures enables us to evaluate their relative importance and to identify the liquidity proxies that most affect prices. Although all the measures are highly correlated with one another, we find that quoted bid-ask spread and quoted depth are more important than effective spread and trade size, respectively. Among measures of market activity, however, the number of trades and volume are more related to the liquidity premium than the number of quotes. asset pricing; liquidity...|$|R
