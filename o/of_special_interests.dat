Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E

2500|$|According to Abu'l Ma'ali, {{the author}} of bayan al-Adyan, Iranshahri {{considered}} himself a Prophet and wrote a book in Persian which he claimed have received a divine revelation by the angel called Hasti (Existence). [...] He believed in the unity of all religions and considered existing differences among them the results <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> (ḡarażµ) of their followers. [...] According to Biruni, Iranshahri had said that God took covenant from light and darkness {{on the days of}} Nowruz and Mehragan, which may reflect Zurvanite influence. [...] According to Nasir Khusraw, Iranshahri had expressed philosophical concepts in religious terms in such books as Ketab-e jalil and Ketab-e athir, and had led people to the true religion and the understanding of monotheism.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review in}} the Independent Review, a {{quarterly}} academic journal, found the writing style to be [...] "well documented" [...] and [...] "analytical," [...] which exposed the [...] "thoroughly corrosive impact of beltway politics on democratic processes and citizen power." [...] The authors suggest that citizens, {{who used to be}} the [...] "backbone of the western state," [...] are no longer relevant. While government has grown, influential citizens have been reduced to recipients of government services and [...] "marginalized as political actors." [...] Government can raise an army and collect taxes without widespread public support; the withholding tax has made the voluntary component of tax paying less important; a professional military limits the need for citizen soldiers; special interests provide bureaucrats with a substitute for public support. The authors blame, in part, Progressive Era reforms such as primaries and recalls and referendums as weakening the parties' ability to mobilize voters. Neither party has much enthusiasm for mobilizing more voters. Group conflict dominates, and government {{is little more than a}} [...] "broker for competing interests." [...] Inside-the-Beltway regulatory agencies have a huge advantage over colleagues elsewhere. Ginsberg and Crenson think that increased litigation, caused by lowering the requirements for class-action lawsuits, works to the benefit <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>interests</b> who can cause changes beneficial to them without having to energize apathetic voters. The reviewer writes: [...] "the authors trace the civil rights, consumer, and environmental movements from their beginnings as popularly based struggles to the narrow group causes they have become today." [...] The reviewer suggested that the authors have [...] "acuity" [...] but neglected to consider that [...] "big government itself" [...] may be the problem. The reviewer criticized the argument as having [...] "fallen short" [...] in some respects by focusing on non-elected public officials skilled at channeling power to special interests. The reviewer thinks elected officials still have incentives to mobilize wider publics and to act responsibly. But the reviewer concluded that American government might become [...] "a Frankenstein’s monster of exceptionally powerful officialdom with neither defined goals nor clear responsibility to the American public." ...|$|E
