5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> jerseys.

In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
