5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– began to feel a sense <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge.

5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment.

5|$|The {{war began}} with the Libyan {{occupation}} of northern Chad in 1983, when Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi, refusing to recognize {{the legitimacy of the}} Chadian President Hissène Habré, militarily supported the attempt by the opposition Transitional Government <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (GUNT) to overthrow Habré. The plan was foiled by the intervention of France which, first with Operation Manta and later with Operation Epervier, limited Libyan expansion to north of the 16th parallel, in the most arid and sparsely inhabited part of Chad.|$|E
5|$|While militarily Habré {{was only}} partly {{successful}} {{in his attempt}} to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> that had never been seen before in Chad.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} among the citizenry had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, and the source <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity.</b> Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E

The incumbent President, Mwai Kibaki, who represents the Party <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> and Raila Odinga from the Orange Democratic Movement were the leading candidates. Early indications showed that Odinga was likely to win the election, however the results announced by the Electoral Commission of Kenya showed that Kibaki had been re-elected and he {{was sworn in as}} President. Immediately after the Electoral Commission's announcement, Odinga rejected the result, claiming that widespread electoral fraud had taken place. European Union electoral observers also claimed that the electoral commission had failed to ensure the credibility of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Since 1983 Chad was {{de facto}} partitioned, with the {{northern}} half controlled by the rebel Transitional Government <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (GUNT) headed by Goukouni Oueddei and supported on the ground by Libyan forces, while the south was held by the Western-backed Chadian government guided by Hissène Habré. This partition on 16th parallel (the so-called Red Line) into Libyan and French zones of influence was informally recognised by France in 1984, following an accord between France and Libya to withdraw their forces from Chad. The accord was not respected by Libya, which maintained at least 3,000 men stationed in northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> and of passive resistance.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman–Russian {{occupation}} prolonged itself until 1851, {{while the}} 1849 Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Wallachian crown to Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei. In {{contrast to the}} 18481849 setbacks, the period inaugurated by the Crimean War disestablished both Russian domination and the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, within the space of one generation, brought about the fulfillment of virtually all revolutionary projects. The common actions of Moldavians and Wallachians, in pace {{with the presence of}} Wallachian activists in Transylvania, helped circulate the ideal <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> with the ultimate goal of reuniting all majority-Romanian territories within one state.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity.</b> Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become {{the symbol of the}} independence movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity,</b> which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, National Unity {{was one of the most}} active groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E
