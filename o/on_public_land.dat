5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>land,</b> the {{alternative}} route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire {{from some of the}} landowners for improved access to and from their propertiesespecially from the Mügge familyled to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall Gully road was built in the late 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Ranchers grazed {{thousands}} of cattle <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> {{that would later}} {{become part of the}} park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched {{at the base of the}} Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lies along a nature trail in the RMD. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for Levi Manning, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.|$|E

40|$|A {{panel of}} {{professionals}} from the ranching, environmental, agency, and university communities was assembled to examine trends {{relating to the}} future of grazing on federal lands. Five factors were identified that were thought to influence the use of grazed forages over the next 20 years. These factors were (1) multiple uses of <b>public</b> <b>land,</b> (2) <b>public</b> sentiment towards grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands,</b> (3) environmental and federal agency regulations, (4) permittee issues, and (5) use of science and technology for managing <b>public</b> <b>land</b> grazing. A list of issues associated with each of the five factors was concurrently developed. The panel of experts was surveyed to explore the future direction each issue would take and the influence each issue may exert <b>on</b> grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> All four groups were fairly consistent on the way they viewed the future of grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands.</b> The most likely scenario includes (1) {{a significant increase in the}} demand for multiple uses <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands,</b> (2) a continued public sentiment against grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands,</b> (3) and increase in the regulations, and their enforcement, that will negatively impact livestock grazing on the majority of allotments, (4) a continued demand or slight decline in rancher demand for grazing <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>lands,</b> and (5) a significant increase in the use of science and technology for managing <b>public</b> <b>land</b> grazing.

5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E
5|$|Upstream of Lick Run, 13 {{percent of}} Roaring Creek is <b>on</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> {{that is open}} to access. The {{remaining}} 87 percent is on private land that is closed to access. The remaining reaches of the creek are entirely on private land, but open to access. As of 2000, approximately 3,500 people live in the watershed. In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer. In section 01 of the creek, 50 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 89 percent is within 300 meters, and 91 percent is within 500 meters. In section 02, 28 percent is within 100 meters, 87 percent is within 300 meters, and 100 percent is within 500 meters. In section 03, 96 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 98 percent is within 300 meters of one, and 100 percent is within 500 meters of one. The creek flows through a remote-seeming farm valley for {{a substantial part of}} its length.
