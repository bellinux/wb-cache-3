50|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the removal of}} a tooth, bleeding or just oozing very commonly occurs. Pressure is applied by biting on a gauze swab, and a thrombus (blood clot) forms in the socket (hemostatic response). Common haemostatic measures include local pressure application with gauze and the used of oxidized cellulose (gelfoam) and fibrin sealant. Dental practitioners usually have absorbent gauze, haemostatic packing material (<b>oxidised</b> <b>cellulose,</b> collagen sponge) and suture kit available. Sometimes 30 minutes of continuous pressure is required to fully arrest bleeding. Talking, which moves the mandible and hence removes the pressure applied on the socket, instead of keeping constant pressure, is a very common reason that bleeding might not stop. This is likened to someone with a bleeding wound on their arm, when being instructed to apply pressure, instead holds the wound intermittently every few moments. Coagulopathies (clotting disorders, e.g. hemophilia) are sometimes discovered {{for the first time}} if a person has had no other surgical procedure in their life, but this is rare. Sometimes the blood clot can be dislodged, triggering more bleeding and formation of a new blood clot, or leading to a dry socket (see complications). Some oral surgeons routinely scrape the walls of a socket to encourage bleeding in the belief that this will reduce the chance of dry socket, but {{there is no evidence that}} this practice works.|$|E

We analyzed MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and TNF-α in the wound fluid from 20 patients by ELISA every fourteens days over six weeks. Wound size, pain, wound closure and bacterial strains in the wound were also investigated. The wound size was reduced at 14 patients and pain in 16 patients.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of ibuprofen into {{and through the}} skin from novel formulations containing TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibril-based (TOCN) gels was compared to that from two conventional and commercially available products. The gels were evaluated in-vitro (using both silicone membranes, and pig skin) and in-vivo in human volunteers. All gels showed consistent behaviour in a standard in vitro release test. The stratum corneum (SC) uptake and skin penetration of ibuprofen in vitro from the novel gels and the marketed formulations were generally comparable even though the drug loading in the TOCN-based vehicles was only 20 % {{of that in the}} ‘reference’ products.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Formation of {{adhesion}}s after peritoneal surgery {{results in}} high morbidity. Barriers to prevent adhesion are seldom applied, despite {{their ability to}} reduce the severity of adhesion formation. We evaluated the {{benefits and harms of}} four adhesion barriers that have been approved for clinical use. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase for randomised clinical trials assessing use of <b>oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose,</b> hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose, icodextrin, or polyethylene glycol in abdominal surgery. Two researchers independently identified reports and extracted data. We compared use of a barrier with no barrier for nine predefined outcomes, graded for clinical relevance. The primary outcome was reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction. We assessed systematic error, random error, and design error with the error matrix approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD 42012003321. FINDINGS: Our search returned 1840 results, from which 28 trials (5191 patients) were included in our meta-analysis. The risks of systematic and random errors were low. No trials reported data for the effect of <b>oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose</b> or polyethylene glycol on reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction. <b>Oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose</b> reduced the incidence of adhesions (relative risk [RR] 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 86). Some evidence suggests that hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose reduces the incidence of reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction (RR 0. 49, 95 % CI 0. 28 - 0. 88). For icodextrin, reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction did not differ significantly between groups (RR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 03 - 3. 11).

40|$|We {{report the}} ability of {{cellulose}} to support cells {{without the use of}} matrix ligands {{on the surface of the}} material, thus creating a two-component system for tissue engineering of cells and materials. Sheets of bacterial cellulose, grown from a culture medium containing Acetobacter organism were chemically modified with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride or by oxidation with sodium hypochlorite in the presence of sodium bromide and 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpipiridine 1 -oxyl radical to introduce a positive, or negative, charge, respectively. This modification process did not degrade the mechanical properties of the bulk material, but grafting of a positively charged moiety to the cellulose surface (cationic cellulose) increased cell attachment by 70 % compared to unmodified cellulose, while negatively charged, <b>oxidised</b> <b>cellulose</b> films (anionic cellulose), showed low levels of cell attachment comparable to those seen for unmodified cellulose. Only a minimal level of cationic surface derivitisation (ca 3 % degree of substitution) was required for increased cell attachment and no mediating proteins were required.

In such patients a nerve lesion is not apparent, {{and it has been}} suggested that local neural inflammation may be a key factor. The present study examines the extent to which nerve fibres in regions of local inflammation respond to small stretches, and whether functional changes occur throughout the primary afferent neurone. A local neuritis was induced in adult rats by wrapping <b>oxidised</b> <b>cellulose</b> saturated in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) around the peroneal or sciatic nerves. A small cut was made in the perineurium of some of the peroneal lesioned animals. A- and C-fibre recordings were made 2 - 10 days post-surgery from filaments dissected proximal to the lesion. Local mechanosensitivity was assessed using a glass probe and by small stretches. Responses to stretch and local pressure were recorded in 7 % of C- and 8 % of A-fibres from the peroneal nerve following CFA treatment with the sheath opened. A smaller proportion of stretch sensitive fibres were seen in sciatic and peroneal nerves after CFA treatment alone (2 % of C- and 3 % of A-fibres), but such fibres were not seen in control preparations. The most responsive fibres fired to 3 % stretch, which is within the range of nerve stretch seen during normal limb movements. Less than 1 % of stretch sensitive fibres had peripheral fields, indicating that most had probably degenerated distally...|$|E

Both Achilles tendons of 23 female Wistar-Albino rats weighing between 350 and 450  grams were cut and repaired. On the right side, Interceed absorbable adhesion barriers were wrapped around the repaired tendon (group I). On the left, the same procedures were applied except for the Interceed wrapping and these were grouped as control (group II). Animals were sacrificed at postoperative day 28 and macroscopic and histological examination was performed. All the animals survived and no tendon rupture was observed. No wound dehiscence, wound infection or exposure of repaired tendons occurred. Macroscopically, there were three (13. 1 %) tendons without adhesion formation and 20 (86. 9 %) tendons with inferior adhesion formation in group I; on the other hand, there were 16 tendons (69. 5 %) with medium grade adhesion formation and seven tendons (30. 5 %) with severe peritendinous adhesion formation in group II (control group) (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Histologically, adhesion formation was absent in 11 tendons (47. 8 %) and slight in 12 tendons (52. 2 %) in group I; while in group II, it was slight in two (8. 6 %), moderate in 15 (65. 2 %) and severe in six tendons (26. 2 %) (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).

This difference was, however, not statistically significant (p 0. 053). The postoperative haemoglobin value was lower in the stapled group compared to the Surgicel (R) reinforced group 69 g/ 1 (range 42 - 85) versus 82 g/ 1 (range 78 - 90) (p 0. 018). The estimated blood losses by weighing the compresses were 287 ml (range 166 - 379) for the stapled group and 204 ml (range 152 - 264) for the Surgicel (R) reinforced group (p 0. 053). The median number of additional haemostatic sutures in the Surgicel (R) reinforced group was 7 (range 3 - 11) and in the stapled group 10 (range 5 - 15) (p 0. 038). The haemoglobin value was similar {{in the two groups}} week postoperatively; 100 g/ 1 (range 87 - 104) and 102 g/ 1 (range 95 - 114), p 0. 27, in the stapled group and the Surgicel (R) reinforced group, respectively. In the stapled group reinforced with the Surgicel (R) there was one postoperative death. In the solely stapled group there was no postoperative death (p 0. 5). Four out of six pigs in the Surgicel (R) group had massive adhesions to the resection lines. One of these six pigs was sacrificed postoperatively as it was ill and had small bowel obstruction secondary to Surgicel (R) induced adhesions. On the other hand, no adhesions were seen in the solely stapled pigs (p 0. 09). At this point, we can not recommend the use of Surgicel (R) to reinforce resection lines at stapled liver resection in the clinical situation, because of the high frequency of adhesions this material creates.

40|$|Biologically active fibers as drug {{carriers}} {{have improved}} characteristics {{in comparison with}} conventional medical therapies. Cellulosic fibers as hydrophilic and biocompatible, nontoxic and eco-friendly make a good polymer matrix for obtaining biologically active fibers. Current investigations in this area show that the features of these fibers depend {{on the type of}} carrier as well as the drug structure. Loading drugs on the fiber carrier is accomplished by ionic bonding between ionized drugs and the groups fixed on the fiber (by ion exchange) or loosely adsorption on the fiber through hydrophobic interactions. These interactions can be achieved between hydrophobic parts of the drug and the fiber carrier or among the hydrophobic drugs bonded on the fiber. Prevailing mechanism of ionized drug bonding on the carrier is ionic, although different hydrophobic interactions can contribute the drug loading to varying degrees. In this paper oxidized cellulose (OC) with different carboxylic group content is obtained by selective oxidation and used for chemical bonding of antibiotic ceftazidime. In its structure this antibiotic has aminothiazole ring and pyridine ring in the side chains of cephem nucleus. Ceftazidime has two carboxylic groups and also great number of electron donors and acceptors. Due to these groups and structures ceftazidime is able to form multiple chemical bonds i. e. interactions with oxidized cellulosic bandage. The bonding was performed in antibiotic water solution concentration of c= 3, 4 ∙ 10 - 3 mol/L at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C), while desorption was performed in physiological solution. The amounts of bonded and released antibiotic were determined spectrophotometrically in UV range. Maximum amount of bound drug (0, 0243 mg/g) was obtained during the sorption on the oxidized bandage with 2, 276 mmol/g COOH and the maximum amount of released drug was 0, 0238 mmol/g. Antimicrobial activity of the samples with bonded ceftazidime was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis i Escherichia coli by agar diffusion test. The bigest zone of inhibition was obtained for Escherichia. The paper studies the influence of ceftazidime chemical structure, pH of solution in which sorption is performed and sorption duration, on the amount of bonded drug. It was established that the drug bonding was achieved by ionic bonds and the hydrogen bonds of the drug functional groups with <b>oxidised</b> <b>cellulose</b> bandage. Also it was found that buffering of the drug solution, in which bonding is performed, can increase the amount of ceftazidime bonded on the fiber...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of two widely used topical haemostatic agents: <b>oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose</b> gauze and Collagen-Fibrinogen-Thrombin Patch in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. Material of study: This was a prospective, comparative, non-randomised study in which consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign disease received standard treatment with no haemostatic agent, cellulose gauze, or CFTP. Main outcome measures were drainage volume 24 hours after surgical procedure and the occurrence of post-operative complications (haematoma, seroma, surgical-site infection). Results: Two hundred seventy-one (271) patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign disease: 65 received standard treatment, 60 received cellulose gauze and 146 received CFTP. Seroma was significantly reduced in the CFTP group compared with both the cellulose gauze group (p= 0. 006) and the standard treatment group (p= 0. 017). A significant reduction in drainage volume was also observed with CFTP compared {{with the other two}} groups (both p< 0. 001). Drainage volume was also significantly reduced with cellulose gauze versus standard treatment (p< 0. 001). No septic events were observed after application of CFTP. One hematoma was observed in the non haemostatic group. Conclusions: Both haemostatic agents reduced the amount of sero-hematic fluid during the first 24 hours post-surgery, with CFTP more effective than oxidized cellulose gauze.

Bone marrow aspiration showed an infiltration by a lymphoproliferative malignancy and the following cytochemical studies on bone marrow sample led to diagnosis of HCL. The biopsy of the skin lesion revealed a infiltrate of medium and large-size cells in the dermis with the the same cytologic features of leukemic blasts appearing in the bone marrow, upon which the diagnosis of Leukemia cutis was established. The differential diagnosis of leukemia includes other neoplastic hematopoietic disorders, such as lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, severe megaloblastic anemia, severe lymphocytosis, severe monocytosis, and bone marrow failure. In our case, the skin lesion was surgically removed and then left to heal by secondary intention due to the presence of bacterial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The wound was finally medicated to total healing with Promogran (R), an advanced dressings which consists of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix composed of collagen and <b>oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose.</b> The importance of our case lies in the fact that cases with association of HCL with leukemia cutis are very rare, and furthermore that after the excision of the skin lesion of the left hand, the surgeons heal to let the wound close by secondary intention...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of epistaxis in patient with coagulopathies can be traumatic {{for both the}} patient and the attending physician. This can be rather frustrating especially in children with haematological malignancies. Packing these children’s nasal cavity can be difficult and the trauma associated with the packing can further aggravate epistaxis. Conventional nasal packs, including BIPP (bismuth iodine paraffin paste), merocel or kaltostat are usually used to pack the nasal cavity while the coagulopathies are corrected. However, the coagulation profile can be rather difficult to correct in patients with haematological malignancies e. g. leukaemia. Thrombocytopenia or low platelet count is usually the commonest coagulopathy and can be resistant to platelet transfusion which raises the platelet counts only temporarily 1. Nasal packs are not without its morbidity. Packs have been reported to absorb large quantities of platelets that are being transfused and occasionally get infected. Furthermore, removal of nasal packs usually leaves raw areas, which again tend to bleed. This starts a vicious cycle. We have found that the use of surgicel (<b>oxidised</b> regenerated <b>cellulose)</b> as a nasal pack can be effective especially in children and especially in minor anterior epistaxis. Surgicel is applied as a single or double layer and applied to the bleeding area in the nasal cavity with 1 cm sticking out of the nostrils to prevent posterior displacement into the nasopharynx. When wet, surgicel adheres to the nasal mucosa, reducing epistaxis, and airflow is still maintained. Surgicel is usually absorbed or extrudes out after some time. This method avoids the discomfort associated with conventional nasal packs and the traumatic raw areas upon removal. Surgicel also has bactericidal action against a wide range of gram positive, gram negative and even anaerobic organism 2. We have found this method to be convenient and well tolerated even by children. We have tried this method in three children (age range 2 - 6) with haematological malignancies with coagulopathies till date and have found it useful in all of them while waiting for correction of the coagulation profile. We would recommend the use of surgicel in this manner especially for epistaxis among children under local anaesthesia...|$|R

Once inhaled or administered, the nanoparticles are likely to be recognised by innate immune molecules in the lungs such as hydrophilic pulmonary surfactant proteins. Here, we set out to examine the interaction between surfactant protein D (SP-D), a key lung pattern recognition molecule and CNTs, and possible downstream effects on the immune response via macrophages. We show here that a recombinant form of human SP-D (rhSP-D) bound to <b>oxidised</b> and carboxymethyl <b>cellulose</b> (CMC) coated CNTs via its C-type lectin domain and enhanced phagocytosis by U 937 and THP- 1 macrophages/monocytic cell lines, together with an increased pro-inflammatory response, suggesting that sequestration of SP-D by CNTs in the lungs can trigger an unwanted and damaging immune response. We also observed that functionalised CNTs, opsonised with rhSP-D, continued to activate complement via the classical pathway, suggesting that C 1 q, which is the recognition sub-component of the classical pathway, and SP-D have distinct pattern recognition sites on the CNTs. Consistent with our earlier reports, complement deposition on the rhSP-D opsonised CNTs led to dampening of the pro-inflammatory immune response by THP- 1 macrophages, as evident from qPCR, cytokine array and NF-κB nuclear translocation analyses. This study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between innate immune humoral factors including complement in devising nanoparticle based drug delivery strategies...|$|R
