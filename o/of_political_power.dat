5|$|From the mid-Heian period, {{the palace}} {{suffered}} several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors {{and some of}} the office functions resided outside the palace. This, along with the general loss <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> of the court, acted to further diminish the importance of the palace as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 the palace burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of the palace is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> and solidarity within the group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} conformity was {{passed through the}} House of Commons and debated in the Lords. Figures such as Henry Sacheverell, a High church clergyman, warned against Dissenters assuming positions <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power.</b> His lead {{was followed by the}} Tory press, who published a number of sermons and pamphlets making similar arguments. In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, The Shortest Way, assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.|$|E

5|$|Manila, {{being the}} seat <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> of the Philippines, has several {{national}} government offices headquartered at the city. Planning {{for the development}} for being the center of government started {{during the early years}} of American colonization when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington, D.C. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power.</b> In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E

50|$|English {{independence}} {{is a political}} stance advocating secession of England, {{the largest and most}} populous country of the British Isles, from the United Kingdom. Support for secession of England has been influenced by the increasing devolution <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>powers</b> to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where independence from the United Kingdom is a prominent subject <b>of</b> <b>political</b> debate.|$|R
50|$|In {{most other}} {{parliamentary}} systems, including other constitutional monarchies, these duties are instead {{handled by the}} head of state. Relieving the Swedish Monarch from exercise <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>powers,</b> although not the key objective from the outset, became nevertheless an important part on the constitutional reform in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{supported}} Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in {{an unsuccessful}} {{effort to prevent}} the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Mobutu {{launched}} a second coup d'état against {{the central government}} and took personal emergency powers. Once established as the sole source <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and {{efforts were made to}} remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country. By the time of its disestablishment, Zaire was characterised by widespread croneyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly {{the same amount of}} {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700cm per year in the east and over 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the Junkers, retained a substantial share <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> in the unified state. The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power {{to the absence of}} a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.|$|E
50|$|According to William I. Robinson, it is {{a system}} where small group {{actually}} rules on behalf of capital, and majority’s decision making is confined to choosing among selective number of elites within tightly controlled elective process. It {{is a form of}} consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital which allowed concentration <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Every {{recognized}} {{religious group}} in Austria can collect church tax {{at a rate}} of 1.1%, though currently only the Catholic Church makes use of that opportunity. Church tax is compulsory for Catholics in Austria. This tax was introduced by Adolf Hitler in 1939.

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power</b> is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> and therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
