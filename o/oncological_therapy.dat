Although Agaricus subrufescens is cultivated in the United States, the largest exporters are China and Brazil.

The recognition that some tumours responded completely to pre-operative chemoradiotherapy, and the selective use of a non-operative policy has led to a quest to further identify those patients and their tumour in whom this approach could be used, irrespective of MRI stage. With no clear patient factors identified, the tumour and its gene expression has become a target for research to identify individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which may indicate a response to specific treatment, or not. To date some agents have been identified and trialed, such as cetuximab, with individual tumours being assessed for response allowing directed treatment. The reviewed paper by Sebio and colleagues report a study that links polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene XRCC 1 with response to neoadjuvant 5 -Fluorouracil treatment in rectal cancer patients.

40|$|Abstract Background The optimal {{operative}} {{approach for}} carcinoma {{at the lower}} esophagus and esophagogastric junction remains controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess a single unit experience of transhiatal esophagectomy in an era when the use of systemic <b>oncological</b> <b>therapies</b> has increased dramatically. Study Design Between January 2000 and November 2006, 215 consecutive patients (182 males, 33 females, median age = 65 years) underwent transhiatal esophagectomy; invasive malignancy was detected preoperatively in 188 patients. 90 patients (42 %) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prospective data was obtained for these patients and cross-referenced with cancer registry survival data. Results There were 2 in-hospital deaths (0. 9 %). Major complications included: respiratory complications in 65 patients (30 %), cardiovascular complications in 31 patients (14 %) and clinically apparent anastomotic leak in 12 patients (6 %). Median length of hospital stay was 14 days. The radicality of resection was inversely related to T stage: an R 0 resection was achieved in 98 – 100 % of T 0 / 1 tumors and only 14 % of T 4 tumors. With a median follow up of 26 months, one and five year survival rates were estimated at 81 % and 48 % respectively. Conclusion Transhiatal esophagectomy is an effective operative approach for tumors of the infracarinal esophagus and the esophagogastric junction.

40|$|Gastric neuroendocrine {{neoplasms}} (NENs) {{are increasing}} in frequency {{and have a}} varied spectrum with regard to histology, clinicopathologic background, stage, and prognosis. They are usually discovered incidentally, {{are for the most}} part benign and are associated with hypergastrinaemia (secondary either to chronic atrophic gastritis or rarely Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; types 1 and 2, respectively) or more rarely sporadic type 3. Applications of recent staging and grading systems - namely using Ki- 67 proliferative indices - (from ENETS and WHO 2010) can be particularly helpful in further categorising these tumours. The natural history of Type 1 gastric carcinoids is generally (> 95 %) favourable and simple surveillance is usually recommended for small (< 1  cm) T 1 tumours, with local (endoscopic or surgical) resection for larger lesions. Other potential therapies such as somatostatin analogues and gastrin receptor antagonists may offer newer therapeutic possibilities.

The success of this therapy is strongly dependent on the precision and control of thermal deposition. Hyperthermia based on induction heating, with thermally self-regulating thermoseeds inserted into the tumorous mass, is used for interstitial treatment. The technique was the subject of the numerical study presented in the paper. The analysis was carried out using coupled electromagnetic heating and thermo-fluid dynamic FEM simulations. During thermal deposition by induction heating of inserted seeds, the simulations estimated the thermal field inside and outside the tumour, as well as the sensitivity of the thermal field to variations regarding seed temperature, configuration and proximity to vessels. The method, for which accurate anatomical patient's information is essential, is suitable for providing useful qualitative and quantitative information about thermal transients and power density distribution for hyperthermic treatment. Several grid steps were analysed and compared. A 1 cm seed grid was resulted in good homogeneity and effectiveness of the thermal deposition. The cold spot effect caused by large vessels was demonstrated and quantified. Simulations of the heating of a tumorous mass in the liver showed that an indcutor generator operating at 200 kHz frequency and 500 A current, producing a pulsating magnetic field of H = 60 A cm(- 1), was adequate for the treatment. The seeds that perform best among those tested (Nicu (28 % Cu), PdNi (27. 2 % Ni), PdCo (6. 15 % Co) and ferrite core) were the PdNi (1 mm radius, 10 mm length), as they have a low Curie temperature (52 degreesC), which is the closest to the desired treatment temperature and thus reduces the risk of hot spots...|$|R
