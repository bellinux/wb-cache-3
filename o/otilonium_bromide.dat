40|$|Antispasmodics {{are used}} {{clinically}} {{to treat a}} variety of gastrointestinal disorders by inhibition of smooth muscle contraction. The main pathway for smooth muscle Ca 2 + entry is through L-type channels; however, there is increasing evidence that T-type Ca 2 + channels {{also play a role}} in regulating contractility. <b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> an antispasmodic, has previously been shown to inhibit L-type Ca 2 + channels and colonic contractile activity. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> also inhibits T-type Ca 2 + channels. Whole cell currents were recorded by patch-clamp technique from HEK 293 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the T-type Ca 2 + channels, CaV 3. 1 (α 1 G), CaV 3. 2 (α 1 H), or CaV 3. 3 (α 1 I) alpha subunits. Extracellular solution was exchanged with <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (10 − 8 to 10 − 5 M). <b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> reversibly blocked all T-type Ca 2 + channels with a significantly greater affinity for CaV 3. 3 than CaV 3. 1 or CaV 3. 2. Additionally, the drug slowed inactivation in CaV 3. 1 and CaV 3. 3. Inhibition of T-type Ca 2 + channels may contribute to inhibition of contractility by <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> This may represent a new mechanism of action for antispasmodics and may contribute to the observed increased clinical effectiveness of antispasmodics compared with selective L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Awareness of the {{seriousness}} of irritable bowel disorder (IBS) remains low among clinicians. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of IBS and highlight the major personal, economic, and social burden of the disease, and the importance of adequate treatment of what is still often viewed as a trivial disorder. In fact, IBS is a major reason for referral. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: It is crucial that the varied pathophysiologies of this complex heterogeneous disease are understood {{in order to be able}} to treat both the presenting symptoms (pain, bloating, flatulence, abnormal defecation, diarrhea, constipation) and the underlying disorder effectively. Low-grade inflammatory and immune activation has been observed, but the precise triggers and mechanisms, and the relevance to symptom generation, remain to be established. TREATMENT: IBS patients require different treatment strategies according to the pattern, severity, frequency, and symptoms. While initial therapy traditionally targets the most bothersome symptom, long-term therapy aims at maintaining symptom control and preventing recurrence. In addition to dietary/lifestyle interventions and psychosocial strategies, a wide range of pharmacologic therapies are approved for use in IBS depending on the symptoms reported. Musculotropic spasmolytics, which act directly on intestinal smooth muscle contractility, such as <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> are effective, particularly in the relief of abdominal pain and bloating, and are well tolerated in IBS. THE OBIS TRIAL: The recent large placebo-controlled <b>Otilonium</b> <b>Bromide</b> in Irritable Bowel Syndrome study demonstrated the superiority of <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> versus placebo not only in the reduction of pain and bloating, but also in protection from relapse due to the long-lasting effect. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (OB) is {{a smooth}} muscle relaxant {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of irritable bowel syndrome. <b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> has been shown to interfere with the mobilization of calcium in intestinal smooth muscle, but the effects on other intestinal tissues have not been investigated. We identified the muscarinic receptor subtype coupled to calcium signals in colonic crypt derived from the human colonic epithelium and evaluated the inhibitory effects of OB. Calcium signals were monitored by fluorescence imaging of isolated human colonic crypts and Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the cloned human muscarinic M 3 receptor subtype (CHO-M 3). Colonic crypt receptor expression was investigated by pharmacological and immunohistochemical techniques. The secretagogue acetylcholine (ACh) stimulated calcium mobilization from intracellular calcium stores at the base of human colonic crypts with an EC 50 of 14 μM. The muscarinic receptor antagonists 4 -DAMP, AF-DX 384, pirenzepine and methroctamine inhibited the ACh-induced calcium signal with the following respective IC 50 (pKb) values: 0. 78 nM (9. 1), 69 nM (7. 2), 128 nM (7. 1), and 2510 nM (5. 8). Immunohistochemical analyses of muscarinic receptor expression demonstrated the presence of M 3 receptor subtype expression at the crypt-base. <b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> inhibited the generation of ACh-induced calcium signals in a dose dependent manner (IC 50 = 880 nM). In CHO-M 3 cells, OB inhibited calcium signals induced by ACh, but not ATP. In addition, OB did not inhibit histamine-induced colonic crypt calcium signals. The present studies have demonstrated that OB inhibited M 3 receptor-coupled calcium signals in human colonic crypts and CHO-M 3 cells, but not those induced by stimulation of other endogenous receptor types. We propose that the M 3 receptor-coupled calcium signalling pathway is directly targeted by OB {{at the level of the}} colonic epithelium, suggestive of an anti-secretory action in IBS patients suffering with diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{prepare the}} surface {{generated}} by small intestinal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) for the surface plasmon reso-nance (SPR) analysis, {{which allows the}} real-time measurement of binding events occurring on the intestinal membrane. Methods. BBMVs were isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats, sus-pended in HEPES-buffered saline, and flowed {{over the surface of}} a SPR sensor chip composed of dextran derivatives modified with li-pophilic residues. The surface coverage was determined from binding of bovine serum albumin to BBMV-immobilized sensor chip. The performance of BBMVs immobilized was evaluated by their interac-tion with <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> and bile salts. Results. The stable BBMV surface was achieved when BBMV sus-pension was flowed over the sensor chip for 8 h at a rate of 2 l/min. The flow of <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> resulted in an increased SPR signal because of its binding to calcium channel, which is known to be distributed over the gastrointestinal tact. When bile salts were flowed over ileal and duodenal BBMV surfaces, respectively, a slightly higher SPR signal was observed in the ileal BBMV surface, indicating the specific interaction of bile salts with bile acid transporters. Conclusions. BBMV surfaces may be useful for the estimation of binding events on the intestinal membrane by SPR analysis, espe-cially for the drugs that are orally administrated.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} is a prevalent and chronic disorder, characterized by recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and altered bowel habits. This condition affects an estimated 10 - 15 % {{of the population}} worldwide and impacts heavily on a patient's daily life and ability to work, as well as healthcare resource utilization. Drug therapy aimed at correcting the primary symptoms of diarrhea/constipation/bloating may have little effect on abdominal pain, which results from visceral hypersensitivity. Smooth muscle relaxants or antispasmodics decrease the tone and contractility of intestinal smooth muscle, effectively managing abdominal pain. <b>Otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> has been widely used worldwide and {{has been found to}} be safe and well tolerated, and superior to placebo for the reduction of symptoms and the prevention of symptom relapse in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disease of cyclic nature characterized by recurrent symptoms. IBS patients should receive, as initial therapeutic approach a short course of treatment which, if effective, has the additional value of confirming the diagnosis. Long-term treatment should be reserved to diagnosed IBS patients with recurrent symptoms. Clinical trials with stabilized therapies and new active treatments showed an improvement of the symptoms over placebo that is often time-dependent but with high relapse rates (around 40 %– 50 % when stopping treatment). Relapse is not always immediate after stopping treatment and the recent data from OBIS trial with <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> or with psychotherapy, showed that due to different chemico-physical characteristics of the drugs or the psychosomatic impact to the disease not all treatment gave the same relapsing rate if compared to placebo.

40|$|Antispasmodics {{including}} <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (OB) {{are recommended}} to treat {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS). However, reports about OB experience in Asia is sparse. The purpose of {{present study was to}} provide the efficacy of OB in treating Asian IBS patients. Methods Overall, 117 IBS patients meeting Rome II criteria were enrolled in an 8 -week, double-blind, active-controlled and single center trial. Randomized participants received either OB 40 mg or mebeverine 100 mg 3 doses daily. The primary endpoints were to evaluate the net changes of abdominal pain/discomfort frequency score (APDFS) and safety profile, while the secondary endpoints were to assess the changes in abdominal pain/discomfort intensity, flatulence, abdominal bloating, satisfied stool frequency etc. Results Finally, 49 OB and 52 mebeverine subjects were eligible for efficacy analysis. Compared to baselines in per protocol populations, the reduced APDFSs in OB and mebeverine were 0. 55 ± 1. 20 (P = 0. 011) and 0. 37 ± 1. 11 (P = 0. 042), respectively, to show similarly reduced scores. The most reported side effects included dry mouth, nausea and dizziness. Besides, the improved APDFSs at 4 th week visit, final alleviations in abdominal pain intensity, flatulence, abdominal bloating and satisfied stool frequency with global assessments filled by both patients and investigators were significantly achieved by bot...|$|E
40|$|Rat colonic {{circular}} muscle, main {{target of}} <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (OB) spasmolytic activity, is subdivided in an {{inner and outer}} portion. Since the inner one is particularly rich in organelles involved in calcium availability (caveolae, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria), the expression of specific markers (Caveolin- 1, eNOS, calreticulin, calsequestrin) {{in comparison with the}} outer portion was investigated. The possible changes of these organelles and related markers, and of muscarinic receptors (Mr 2) were then studied after OB chronic exposition. Rats were treated with 2 - 20 mg/kg/OB for 10 or 30 days. Proximal colon was processed by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. In colon strips the stimulated contractility response to muscarinic agonist was investigated. The inner portion showed a higher expression of Caveolin- 1 and Mr 2, but not of eNOS, calreticulin and calsequestrin, compared to the outer portion. Chronic OB treatment caused similar ultrastructural and immunohistochemical changes in both portions. Organelles and some related markers were increased at 10 days; Mr 2 expression and muscle contractility induced by methacholine was increased at 30 days. The present findings: 1) provide new information on the immunohistochemical properties of the inner portion of the circular layer that are in favour of a role it might play in colonic motility distinct from that of the outer portion; 2) demonstrate that chronically administered OB interferes with cell structures and molecules responsible for calcium handling and storage, and modifies cholinergic transmission. In conclusion, chronic OB administration in the colonic circular muscle layer directly interacts with the organelles and molecules calcium-related and with the Mr 2...|$|E
40|$|John K Triantafillidis, George Malgarinos Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit, IASO General Hospital, Athens, Greece Abstract: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a {{very common}} functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits. The disease affects {{a large part of}} the world population. The clinical course is mostly characterized by a cyclic recurrence of symptoms. Therefore, IBS patients should receive, as an initial therapeutic approach, a short course of treatment, and long-term treatment should be reserved for those patients with recurrent symptoms. The available clinical trials show that significant improvement of the symptoms over placebo could be achieved with various drugs, although this improvement is frequently time dependent and with high relapse rates after the cessation of the treatment. In a proportion of patients, clinically obvious relapse could appear long after stopping the treatment. Some of the available pharmacologic agents, including <b>otilonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (OB), are able to significantly prolong the time to the appearance of relapse, compared with placebo. As a consequence, some authors suggest that a cyclic treatment could be of benefit. Antispasmodic drugs have been used for many years in an effort to control the symptoms of IBS. OB is a poorly absorbed spasmolytic drug, exerting significantly greater control of the symptoms of IBS compared with placebo. Recent data suggest that the drug could effectively be used for the long-term management of patients with IBS. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with an evidence-based overview of the efficacy and tolerability of OB in the long-term management of IBS patients, based on the results of the clinical trials published so far.
