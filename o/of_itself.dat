All other holiness, and righteousness, and truth, and love, are only pictures and patterns of God, just as the sun's reflection in water, or in a glass, is a picture and pattern of the sun. As the Epistle for to-day tells us: [...] "Every good gift and every perfect is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights." ...|$|R

Discriminative approaches aim at mitigating both view variations and intra-subject variations <b>of</b> gait <b>itself</b> at the same time, and hence the intra-subject variations <b>of</b> gait <b>itself</b> included the training set are rather welcomed to train a better discriminative models. Our database contains intra-subject variations <b>of</b> gait <b>itself</b> for all the camera views because of two gait sequences captured for each camera. Hence, they are also useful for training the discriminative approaches.|$|R

5|$|Before the storm's arrival, {{residents}} of Grand Isle, Louisiana, were evacuated. As a weak tropical storm, damages from Hermine were light. Rainfall spread from Louisiana through Georgia, causing isolated flash flooding. In some areas, the storm tide prolonged the coastal flooding from a tropical cyclone. Gusty winds were reported. Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles, and inflicted one injury. While Hermine was not <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> a particularly damaging storm, its effects combined {{with those of}} other tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet starship, Enterprise, {{registration}} NX-01.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in 2009 led to Church of Scientology-owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology. The Church of Scientology {{has long had}} a controversial history on the Internet, and has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> from the web. From early in Wikipedia's history, conflict arose within the topic of Scientology on the website. Disputes began in earnest in 2005, with users disagreeing {{about whether or not}} to describe Scientology as an abusive cult or religion. By 2006, disagreements concerning the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia had grown more specific. Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts.|$|E

Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April, the Korean Traditional Liquor and Cake festival in March, and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu-sin.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care <b>of</b> <b>itself,</b> and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|Bohra {{visits the}} site to {{retrieve}} Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into a ruthless killer. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> and kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can {{give birth to a}} preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to many casualties and much property destruction. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.|$|E
5|$|Chao {{are small}} creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with {{pleasant}} and relaxing personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in Sonic Adventure 2, states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, spins around, or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has been treated well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has been treated poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and <b>of</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by a sequel, , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region. However, Giovanni, whose memories were left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> from his and his soldiers' minds, while leaving the others unaffected. As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own.|$|E
5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not <b>of</b> <b>itself</b> guarantee improved performance.|$|E
