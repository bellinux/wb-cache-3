5|$|The Pande Lab {{is part of}} Stanford University, a {{non-profit}} entity, and does not sell the results generated by Folding@home.

The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the Blue Gene supercomputer, and they share Folding@home's key software with <b>other</b> <b>researchers,</b> so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas. In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, {{which is based on}} Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large computer clusters or supercomputers. Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration.

5|$|In 2008, Ivakhnenko {{included}} the Akidnognathidae (as the Euchambersiidae) as the sister {{group of the}} family Whaitsiidae in the superfamily Whaitsioidea. However, <b>other</b> <b>researchers</b> {{do not include the}} Akidnognathidae in the Whaitsioidea. Phylogenies by Huttenlocker et al. found that the Akidnognathidae was instead closest to the Chthonosauridae, with the two forming the sister group to the group containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The topology recovered by the 2016 analysis of Huttenlocker et al. is shown below.|$|E
5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after <b>other</b> <b>researchers</b> finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before <b>other</b> <b>researchers</b> grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>researchers</b> {{prior to}} modern DNA {{analysis}} developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>researchers,</b> like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods would now not even be classified as dinosaurs.|$|E

50|$|Although Stepinac's {{life has}} been the subject of much writing, there are very few primary sources for {{researchers}} to draw upon, the main one being the Katolički List, a diocesan weekly journal. Stepinac's diary, discovered in 1950 (too late to be used in his trial), was confiscated by the Yugoslav authorities; it currently resides in Belgrade in the archives of the Federal Ministry of Justice, but only the extracts quoted by Jakov Blažević, the public prosecutor at Stepinac's trial, in his memoir Mač a ne Mir are available. Father Josip Vranković kept a diary from December 1951 to 10 February 1960, recording what Stepinac related to him each day; that diary was used by Franciscan Aleksa Benigar to write a biography of Stepinac, but Benigar refused to share the diary with any <b>other</b> <b>researcher.</b> The diocesan archives were also made available to Benigar, but no <b>other</b> <b>researcher.</b>|$|R
5|$|Styles {{for these}} sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, {{included}} T-shaped windows and doors.

5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by <b>other</b> <b>researchers,</b> {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The uses of {{bioluminescence}} by animals include counter-illumination camouflage, mimicry {{of other}} animals, for example to lure prey, and signalling to other individuals {{of the same}} species, such as to attract mates.

5|$|William Beebe was {{a pioneer}} in the field now known as ecology.

5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001.

After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
