40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the applicability of new <b>oxygen</b> <b>meters</b> with multi-channels and disposable oxygen electrode sensors (DOX- 96) on the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical bacterial isolates. The oxygen amount in the wells of 96 -well plates was converted into current through electrodes. Bacterial inoculation decreased the oxygen amount in the wells because viable bacteria consume the oxygen. On the other hand, a failure of bacteria to consume oxygen was observed in the presence of potent antimicrobial agents, representing a serious arrest of bacterial metabolism usually leading to stasis or death. Based on these results, the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by DOX- 96 (MICdox). The MICdox showed good agreement with MIC measured by the standard broth microdilution method (98. 2 %). DOX- 96 was also useful for turbid samples such as Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0. 1 % lipid emulsion. The MICdox in turbid samples showed good agreement with those in clear samples (100. 0 %). These results indicate that the newly developed DOX- 96 is very useful in antimicrobial susceptibility testing even in turbid clinical samples such as colloidal products and turbid biologica...|$|R

5000|$|The {{objective}} is to defeat the Woolies' two queens, Poly and Esther, and also escape from the planet by collecting rocket parts. In Bubsy 3D, players control the player-character Bubsy, who has several catch phrases that he says based on players' actions. Bubsy can jump high, glide, swim, and fly in certain levels. He defeats enemies by jumping on them or shooting atoms at them. He has a health system consisting of three health points called [...] "Paw Points" [...] which can be extended. The game consists of 18 levels, with three of them taking place underwater; in these levels, Bubsy has an <b>oxygen</b> <b>meter</b> that depletes over time and his gliding action {{is replaced by a}} jetting dive which makes him swim faster and attack enemies, but depletes oxygen quicker.

If Bubsy collects 150 atoms, he will go to a bonus round with atoms and extra lives to collect.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the antimicrobial activities of saturated fatty acids and fatty amines against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antimicrobial activity of saturated fatty acids and fatty amines was determined by <b>oxygen</b> <b>meters</b> with multi-channels and disposable oxygen electrode sensors (DOX- 96). Lauric acid, the most effective among the saturated fatty acids, showed antimicrobial activity at 400 μg/ml against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and MRSA. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fatty amines depended on each hydrophobic chain length. The MIC of myristylamine was 1. 56 μg/ml; most effective of the fatty amines. In time-kill curves, lauric acid and myristylamine produced a bactericidal effect and a bacteriostatic effect at 4 -fold the MIC, respectively. The antimicrobial activities of lauric acid and myristylamine were decreased by human plasma. Cytotoxicity of 3 saturated fatty acids and 3 fatty amines was examined in cultured endothelial cells. Although cytotoxicity of fatty amines was severer than that of saturated fatty acids, myristylamine showed the highest value of apparent therapeutic index among them. DOX- 96 was useful for screening antimicrobial substances, especially in the case of insoluble substances.

It features integration of optical oxygen sensors into microreactors, which enables contactless, accurate and inexpensive readout using commercially available <b>oxygen</b> <b>meters</b> via luminescent lifetime measurements {{in the frequency}} domain (phase shifts). The fabrication and patterning of sensor layers down to a size of 100 μm in diameter is performed via automated airbrush spraying and {{was used for the}} integration into silicon-glass microreactors. A novel and easily processable sensor material is also presented and consists of a polystyrene- silicone rubber composite matrix with embedded palladium(II) or platinum(II) meso-tetra(4 -fluorophenyl) tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBPF and PtTPTBPF) as oxygen sensitive dye. The resulting sensor layers have several advantages such as being excitable with red light, emitting in the near-infrared spectral region, being photostable and covering a wide oxygen concentration range. The trace oxygen sensor (PdTPTBPF) in particular shows a resolution of 0. 06 – 0. 22 hPa at oxygen concentrations lower than 20 hPa (< 2 % oxygen) and the normal range oxygen sensor (PtTPTBPF) shows a resolution of 0. 2 – 0. 6 hPa at low oxygen concentrations (< 50 hPa) and 1 – 2 hPa at ambient air oxygen concentrations. The sensors were integrated into different silicon-glass microreactors which were manufactured using mass production compatible processes. The obtained microreactors were applied for online monitoring of enzyme transformations, including d-alanine or d-phenylalanine oxidation by d-amino acid oxidase, and glucose oxidation by glucose oxidase...|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} {{problems}} are diverse and often complex. Adverse {{indoor air quality}} problems can exist which create symptomatic conditions for building occupants. Often, the exact cause, or causes, of the substandard indoor air quality are unknown. Therefore, an investigative approach must usually be taken to identify the source(s) of the air quality problem, and if present, air contaminant concentrations. As the general public becomes {{more aware of the}} problems associated with poor indoor air quality conditions, an associated increase in air quality evaluation requests can be expected. This paper discusses some of the various investigative tools and techniques that can be utilized to identify air quality contaminants when performing an indoor air quality evaluation. These investigative tools and techniques can be used to develop a site specific list of possible contaminants and their sources, and can then be used to determine which contaminants are, in fact, present in adverse concentrations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oxygen {{therapy is}} an {{important}} therapeutic resource for patients with hypoxemia. When changing <b>oxygen</b> flow <b>meters,</b> we have observed that sometimes, even with the same oxygen flow setting as before, a different S-pO 2 is obtained. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of flow meters used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test <b>oxygen</b> flow <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new flow meter accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 flow meters, and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Flow meter precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 flow meters, and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different flow meters, mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min). There {{was no difference between}} new and used flow meters at the flow rates measured, except at 10 L/min. Flow meters precision analysis showed a good reproducibility in 3 repetitive measurements for each flow rate (minimum 0. 95, maximum 0. 99 intraclass correlations). CONCLUSIONS: the flow meters tested showed good precision and poor accuracy.
