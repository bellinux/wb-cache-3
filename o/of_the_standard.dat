Exploring relationships between factors which may affect teachers 2 ̆ 7 use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and teachers 2 ̆ 7 levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards,</b> this study surveyed ninth through twelfth grade United States history teachers in Iowa and Oregon. The research method to determine teachers 2 ̆ 7 levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> was informed by <b>the</b> Levels <b>of</b> Use dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Concerns-Based Adoption Model;The survey questionnaire consisted primarily of sections describing teachers 2 ̆ 7 : social and demographic characteristics; philosophical agreement with historical thinking skills in <b>the</b> Standards; levels <b>of</b> use or non-use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Standards; and comments about the benefits or limitations <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> <b>Standards.</b> Statistical analyses revealed that teachers in Iowa and Oregon have low levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> but have high levels <b>of</b> agreement with <b>the</b> historical thinking skills which are integrated into <b>the</b> <b>Standards.</b> Higher levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> were related to teachers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards,</b> subscription to professional history or social studies journals, membership in professional history or social studies organizations, participation in staff development using <b>the</b> <b>Standards,</b> and work in curriculum development or collaboration with others in developing curriculum using parts or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards.</b> Multiple regression analysis identified teachers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and collaboration with others in developing curriculum which includes part or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> as predictors <b>of</b> higher levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} teachers 2 ̆ 7 levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> in Iowa and Oregon;It is concluded that teachers may need to become more informed about <b>the</b> <b>Standards,</b> and that school districts and state departments of education may need to support teachers efforts to work collaboratively on curriculum development, to increase teachers 2 ̆ 7 levels <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} <b>the</b> initial analysis <b>of</b> baseline {{findings from}} <b>the</b> Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Professional <b>Standards</b> for Teachers. It comprises analysis of findings from key 2013 data collection activities – the National Forum and National Survey. These activities investigated stakeholders’ knowledge of, attitudes towards, use of, and impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> on teacher quality. The findings demonstrate that awareness and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> is high given <b>the</b> early stage <b>of</b> implementation. Other key findings {{outlined in the}} report include: •Broad awareness and understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> as demonstrated by <b>the</b> wide range <b>of</b> activities reported in The Forum •An average of 70 % of stakeholders reported knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> •An average <b>of</b> 61 % of teachers, school leaders and teacher educators who completed the Survey reported use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> in their practice •Self-reflection and discussion with colleagues are the most commonly reported use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> from survey respondents •An average of 74 % of survey respondents reported opportunity to use <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and an average of 78 % intend to use <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> in <b>the</b> next six months.  The interim report concludes that while {{there is evidence of}} implementation activity across Australia, continuing focus on, and resourcing <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> is required to support stakeholders to increase their implementation activity and embed <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> within their daily practice.  ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{critique}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reductionist, technical and instrumentalist impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Professional <b>Standards</b> for Teachers from critical policy researchers in education. At the same time, advocates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> espouse their potential as providing a common language of teaching. We argue that both views are based on logical rather than empirical warrants. Therefore, this study sought to gather empirical data via a survey of 229 teacher education students followed by focus groups in an endeavour to record their perceptions on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> as assessment criteria for professional experience. The findings are that a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students were advocates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> as a learning scaffold. This was especially true in contexts where their supervising teachers were not au fait with <b>the</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>The</b> implications <b>of</b> this study for teacher educators are that the formative assessment potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> requires pedagogical consideration in professional experience alongside their more commonly understood role as summative assessment criteria...|$|R
