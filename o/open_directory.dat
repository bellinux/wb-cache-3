50|$|To {{begin the}} {{recording}} process, the software {{connects to the}} audio stream over TCP. The stream is then buffered 15-30 seconds ahead. Some Internet radio ripping software, utilize special metadata that are being sent along with actual song content. These programs are generally more successful in determining the boundaries of songs (providing for a cleaner MP3 cut) as well as correctly identifying the song in question. Such metadata, however, are available for only a subset of Internet streams, commonly associated with the Shoutcast standard. The existence of <b>open</b> <b>directories</b> of Shoutcast-compliant radio stations such as Shoutcast enables Internet radio rippers to provide an abundant selection of recordable radio stations that are reasonably expected to emit detailed song metadata. The metadata also help avoid commercials from being recorded along with the songs.|$|R
