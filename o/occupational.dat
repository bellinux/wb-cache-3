5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, suggests a longer <b>occupational</b> period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long <b>occupational</b> history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E

5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for <b>Occupational</b> Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the <b>Occupational</b> Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v.

25|$|The {{goals of}} <b>occupational</b> {{safety and health}} {{programs}} include to foster a safe and healthy work environment.

25|$|<b>Occupational</b> {{safety and}} health (OSH), also {{commonly}} referred to as <b>occupational</b> health and safety (OHS), <b>occupational</b> health, or workplace health and safety (WHS), is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety, health, and welfare of people at work.

25|$|It {{is noted}} in the {{literature}} that <b>occupational</b> therapists should use specific <b>occupational</b> therapy vocabulary along with the ICF {{in order to ensure}} correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what <b>occupational</b> therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to <b>occupational</b> therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized <b>occupational</b> therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.|$|E
25|$|The health {{profession}} of <b>occupational</b> therapy was conceived {{in the early}} 1910s {{as a reflection of}} the Progressive Era. Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one's own hands with scientific and medical principles. The National Society for the Promotion of <b>Occupational</b> Therapy, now called the American <b>Occupational</b> Therapy Association (AOTA), was founded in 1917 and the profession of <b>Occupational</b> Therapy was officially named in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{the field}} of <b>occupational</b> health come {{from a wide range of}} {{disciplines}} and professions including medicine, psychology, epidemiology, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, <b>occupational</b> therapy, <b>occupational</b> medicine, human factors and ergonomics, and many others.

25|$|<b>Occupational</b> {{therapists}} {{work with}} older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that <b>occupational</b> therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered {{to determine if}} drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence of older adults at home, <b>occupational</b> therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, <b>occupational</b> therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, <b>occupational</b> therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 1969, the Board of Examiners for Physical Therapists and <b>Occupational</b> Therapists in the Philippines (sometimes {{called as}} the Board of Physical and <b>Occupational</b> Therapy) was {{approved}} through Republic Act No. 5680, {{also known as}} the Philippine Physical and <b>Occupational</b> Therapy Law.
