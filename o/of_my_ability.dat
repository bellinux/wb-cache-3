25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability.</b> Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|The Electoral College {{unanimously}} elected Washington as {{the first}} president in 1789 and again in 1792. He remains the only president to receive the totality of electoral votes. John Adams received the next highest vote total and was elected vice president. Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the first presidential oath of office {{on the balcony of}} Federal Hall in New York City. The oath was administered by Chancellor Robert R. Livingston: [...] "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States and will, to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability,</b> preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

2500|$|This mentality {{carries over}} into practice. Peer {{recognition}} {{goes to the}} most thorough and aggressive physicians. The prudent physician is not deemed particularly competent, but rather inadequate. This culture is further reinforced by a unique understanding of professional obligations, specifically, the Hippocratic Oath's admonition to [...] "use my power to help the sick to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> and judgment" [...] as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others.|$|E

Messy Little Raindrops uses a more dance pop sound than her previous album. A Million Lights, her third studio album also incorporates R and dance.

2500|$|Goldwyn offered Sidney Poitier $75,000 {{to portray}} Porgy. The actor had serious {{reservations}} about the role and turned it down, but his agent led Goldwyn to believe she could persuade her client to star in the film. She proved to be unsuccessful, and Goldwyn threatened to sue the actor for breaching an oral contract. When Poitier realized his refusal to star in Porgy might jeopardize his appearance in the Stanley Kramer film The Defiant Ones, he reconsidered and grudgingly accepted, assuring Goldwyn he would [...] "do the part to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> - under the circumstances." ...|$|E

2500|$|Queensrÿche is {{the first}} album by the band to feature a vocalist other than Tate, {{sparking}} concerns with some fans that the sound will be too drastically {{different from what they}} were used to.

2500|$|The 1982 American {{theatrical}} version {{released by}} the studio included the [...] "happy ending" [...] and {{with the addition of}} Harrison Ford's voiceover. Although several different versions of the script had included a narration of some sort, Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott decided to add scenes to provide the information; but financiers rewrote and reinserted narration during post-production after test audience members indicated difficulty understanding the film. Scott did not have final cut privilege for the version released to cinemas. Ford said in 1999: [...] "I contested it mightily at the time. It was not an organic part of the film." [...] It has been suggested that Ford intentionally performed the voice-over badly, in the hope it would not be used, but in a 2002 interview with Playboy magazine, he said: [...] "I delivered it to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ability,</b> given that I had no input. I never thought they'd use it. But I didn't try and sandbag it. It was simply bad narration." [...] The [...] "happy ending" [...] aerial shots were also not filmed by Scott, but rather were unused aerial helicopter shots from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining which Kubrick allowed the use of.|$|E

He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. [...] The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.|$|E
