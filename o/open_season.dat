500|$|The koala {{was heavily}} hunted by European {{settlers}} in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing {{in a letter to}} The Courier-Mail, expressed the popular sentiment: [...] "The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account... He affords no sport to the gun-man... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas." [...] Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month <b>open</b> <b>season</b> in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.|$|E
500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to <b>open</b> <b>season</b> 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E
