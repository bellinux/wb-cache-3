5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask <b>of</b> <b>brandy</b> that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) <b>of</b> <b>brandy.</b> In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle <b>of</b> <b>Brandy</b> Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E

The description of the municipal brewery lets us see in detail the statutes and working of the brewers' guild, including its membership and its problems with beer taverns, through the municipal and guild chronicle. On the other hand, research about the castle brewery is based on sources from Nova manipulace indicating its building adjustment, employees and profit.

5|$|Modeste and Impérieuse were {{high-quality}} modern {{ships and}} were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste {{with the same}} name and Impérieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. The repercussions of this operation were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, {{and as a result}} the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark. Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at Leghorn to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a barrel <b>of</b> <b>brandy</b> was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.|$|E
25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still {{can also be}} used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style <b>of</b> <b>brandy</b> produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples <b>of</b> <b>brandy</b> produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} and quantitatively analyze alcohol volatile congeners in different types of spirits from the domestic producers in order to evaluate their quality according to the Official Regulation. A total of 100 samples of three different types <b>of</b> grape <b>brandies</b> (lozova rakia, komova rakia and vinjak) and 30 samples <b>of</b> plum <b>brandies</b> obtained from seven domestic producers were analyzed on the content of ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, i-propanol, n- propanol, i-butanol, n-butanol, i-amyl alcohol and n-amyl alcohol. Maximum admissible limits were exceeded for methanol content in twelve of tested samples (2 samples <b>of</b> grape <b>brandy</b> lozova, 3 samples <b>of</b> grape <b>brandy</b> komova, 3 samples <b>of</b> grape <b>brandy</b> vinjak and 4 samples <b>of</b> plum <b>brandies).</b> The major higher alcohol present in all tested samples was i-amyl alcohol. The content of i-amyl alcohol in grape brandy lozova rakia and grape brandy komova rakia didn’t show significant statistical difference, since the row material used was similar between the varieties.

25|$|Returning to {{the cavalry}} for the Gettysburg Campaign, Stuart endured the two low points in his career, {{starting}} with the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Brandy</b> Station, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war. By June 5, two of Lee's infantry corps were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast, holding {{the line of the}} Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, mostly near Brandy Station, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy. Stuart requested a full field review of his troops by Gen. Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (threekm) southwest <b>of</b> <b>Brandy</b> Station.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{into the}} war, {{during the summer}} of 1863, the Union cavalry came into its own.
