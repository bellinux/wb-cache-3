5000|$|The Lurgi-Ruhrgas {{process is}} a hot {{recycled}} solids technology, which processes fine particles of coal or <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> sized 0.25 to 0.5 in. As a heat carrier, it uses spent char or spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> (<b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> ash), mixed with sand or other more durable materials. [...] In this process, crushed coal or <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> is fed {{into the top of}} the retort. [...] In retort, coal or <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> is mixed with the [...] heated char or spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> particles in the mechanical mixer (screw conveyor). [...] The heat is transferred from the heated char or spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> to the coal or raw <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> causing pyrolysis. As a result, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> decomposes to <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> vapors, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas and spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> [...] The <b>oil</b> vapor and product gases pass through a hot cyclone for cleaning before sending to a condenser.

5000|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas is {{produced}} by retorting (pyrolysis) of <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> In the pyrolysis process, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> is heated until its kerogen decomposes into vapors of a petroleum-like condensable <b>shale</b> <b>oil,</b> non-condensible combustible <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas, and spent shale - a solid residue. [...] The process {{is the same as}} the <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> extraction and <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas usually occurs as a byproduct of <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> production. The ratio of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas to <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> depends on retorting temperature and as a rule, increases by the rise of temperature.|$|R
50|$|As a heat carrier, LLNL HRS process uses spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> Raw <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> {{and spent}} <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> are mixed in the {{fluidized}} bed mixer. The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> to the raw <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> causing pyrolysis. As a result, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> decomposes to <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> vapors, <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> gas and spent <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> <b>Oil</b> vapors are collected from the pyrolyzer.

The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.|$|R
5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator.

40|$|This paper mainly {{describes}} the world’s commercial <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting technologies, including lump <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and particulate <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting technologies. Fushun Type Retorting, Petrosix Retorting, and Kiviter Retorting are illustrated as {{the examples of}} lump <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting; Galoter Retorting and Alberta Taciuk Processing(ATP) are as the particulate <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting. Comparison of different retorting technologies are discussed. I. Underground Retorting Underground retorting, also called in-situ retorting, is the technology for processing <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> in-situ underground; it is usually carried out by introducing air to burn and pyrolyze the underground <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> layer to obtain <b>shale</b> <b>oil.</b> This process obviates the problems of mining, handling, and disposing of large quantity of material, which occurs for aboveground retorting. In-situ retorting offers the potential of recovering the deep buried <b>oil</b> <b>shale.</b> The true in-situ method is not successful, because <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> lacks permeability, thus hindering the inflow of air and outflow of produced oil and gases, also lowering the heat transfer into the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> deposit.

25|$|Petroleum {{and natural}} gas are formed by the {{anaerobic}} decomposition of remains of organisms including phytoplankton and zooplankton that settled to the sea (or lake) bottom in large quantities under anoxic conditions, millions of years ago. Over geological time, this organic matter, mixed with mud, got buried under heavy layers of sediment. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter, first into a waxy material known as kerogen which is found in <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in {{a process known as}} catagenesis. Despite these heat driven transformations (which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter), the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin.|$|E
25|$|Petroleum is {{a fossil}} fuel derived from ancient fossilized organic materials, such as {{zooplankton}} and algae. Vast quantities of these remains settled to sea or lake bottoms, mixing with sediments and being buried under anoxic conditions (no oxygen). As further layers settled {{to the sea}} or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions. This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, which is found in various <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons via {{a process known as}} catagenesis. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon pyrolysis in a variety of mainly endothermic reactions at high temperature or pressure, or both.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Oil</b> <b>shale,</b> a kind {{of energy}} source, is an {{important}} alternative to petroleum. Considering the Haishiwan mine of the Yaojie coalfield, China, as a typical study case, an exploitation and utilization system for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> was investigated. The system consists of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mining and comprehensive utilization. Haishiwan <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> has developed in a paragenetic relationship with humic coal in coal measure strata. Underground mining technology {{is applied to the}} <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam. The exploitation and utilization system for Haishiwan <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> has a great significance for two reasons. On the one hand, combined with gas drainage technology, the mining of the <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam can eliminate the risk of coal and gas outburst from the underlying coal seam in a particular area and ensure the safe mining of the coal seam. Thus the economic value of this thin <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> seam is improved. On the other hand, the mined <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> can be fully made use of by a comprehensive utilization technology. The latter includes <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> retorting, combustion of semicoke, fine <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> and fuel gases for power generation, and utilization of ashes for production of composite cement and other building materials. The industrial chain for <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> exploitation and utilization established in the Yaojie coalfield is highly significant for maximizing the utility of resources and reducing environmental pollution...|$|R

25|$|The {{oil sands}} of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were {{formed as a}} result of the {{formation}} of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting over the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies over the plains, forming the Canadian Rockies. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta very deep, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.|$|E
500|$|Oil-shale {{deposits}} {{formed in}} the shallow seas of continental shelves generally are much thinner than large lake basin deposits. These are typically a few meters thick and are spread over very large areas, extending up to thousands of square kilometers. Of the three lithologic types of <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> siliceous <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are most commonly found in such environment. These <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are not as organically rich as lake-deposited <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> and generally do not contain more than 30gallons per ton of oil shale. <b>Oil</b> <b>shales</b> deposited in lagoonal or small lake environments are rarely extensive and are often associated with coal-bearing rocks. [...] These <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> can have high yields as much as 40gallons per ton (166l/t) of oil shale. However, due to their small areal extent, they are considered unlikely candidates for commercial exploitation.|$|E
500|$|General {{composition}} of <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and kerogen. [...] <b>Oil</b> <b>shales</b> differ from oil-bearing shales, shale deposits that contain petroleum (tight oil) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples of oil-bearing shales are the Bakken Formation, Pierre Shale, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation.|$|E
5000|$|In China, the {{extraction}} of <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> began in 1926 under the Japanese rule.

[...] In Russia, Kashpirskoye <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> near Syzran in the Volga region was mined and processed in 1919-1924 and again starting from 1929. [...] Leningradslanets opened the Kirov <b>oil</b> <b>shale</b> mine in 1934 in Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast and <b>shale</b> <b>oil</b> production started in 1939.

500|$|Another classification, {{known as}} the van Krevelen diagram, assigns kerogen types, {{depending}} on the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen content of oil shales' original organic matter. The most commonly used classification of <b>oil</b> <b>shales,</b> developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton, adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology. This classification designates <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> as terrestrial, lacustrine (lake-bottom-deposited), or marine (ocean bottom-deposited), based on {{the environment of the}} initial biomass deposit. [...] Known <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are predominantly aquatic (marine, lacustrine) origin. [...] Hutton's classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil.|$|E
500|$|The organic {{portion of}} oil shale {{consists}} largely of prebitumen bituminous groundmass, such as remains of algae, spores, pollen, plant cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and woody plants, and cellular debris from other lacustrine, marine, and land plants. [...] While terrestrial <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> contain resins, spores, waxy cuticles, and corky tissues of roots and stems of vascular terrestrial plants, lacustrine <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> include lipid-rich organic matter derived from algae. Marine <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> {{are composed of}} marine algae, acritarchs, and marine dinoflagellates.

500|$|Oil shale, an organic-rich {{sedimentary}} rock, {{belongs to}} the group of sapropel fuels. [...] It does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula, and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries. <b>Oil</b> <b>shales</b> vary considerably in their mineral content, chemical composition, age, type of kerogen, and depositional history and not all <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense. [...] According to the petrologist Adrian C. Hutton of the University of Wollongong, <b>oil</b> <b>shales</b> are not [...] "geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather 'economic' term." [...] Their common defining feature is low solubility in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition.|$|E
