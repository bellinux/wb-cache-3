5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended <b>Ocarina</b> of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. <b>Ocarina</b> of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in <b>Ocarina</b> of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for <b>Ocarina</b> of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|The Wind Waker was {{released}} on December 13, 2002 in Japan, on March 24, 2003 in North America, and on May 2, 2003 in Europe. To promote the release, Nintendo offered a bonus disc as a pre-order incentive which included a GameCube port of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time {{as well as its}} previously unreleased expansion, Ura Zelda. Ura Zelda, largely an adaptation of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time with some changes, including new dungeon challenges, had been developed for the Nintendo 64's 64DD peripheral, but was shelved when that system failed. Ura Zelda was named <b>Ocarina</b> of Time Master Quest in North America and Europe. <b>Ocarina</b> of Time/Master Quest discs became popular items in their own right in North America, with some customers making and then cancelling preorders to get them. To avoid this issue in Europe, Nintendo released the item only in two-disc packages with The Wind Waker.|$|E
5|$|First {{shown as}} a {{technical}} and thematic demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, <b>Ocarina</b> of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division. Both were the first free-roaming 3D game in their respective series. Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release <b>Ocarina</b> of Time for the 64DD, a disk drive peripheral for the system which was also still in development.|$|E
50|$|Multichambered <b>ocarinas</b> are {{manufactured}} {{in a number}} of varieties, including double, triple, and quadruple <b>ocarinas,</b> which use multiple chambers to extend the <b>ocarina's</b> otherwise limited range, but also enable the musician to play more than one note simultaneously. Harmonic <b>ocarinas</b> are specifically designed for polyphony, and in these instruments the range of the chambers usually overlap to some extent (typically at the unison, third, fourth, fifth, seventh or octave). Cross-fingering enables a single chamber to span an entire octave or more.|$|R

5|$|In <b>Ocarina</b> of Time, {{the player}} {{controls}} the playable character Link {{in the land}} of Hyrule. Link sets out on a quest to stop Ganondorf, king of the Gerudo tribe, from obtaining the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants the wishes of its holder. He travels through time and navigates various dungeons to awaken the sages, who have the power to seal Ganondorf away forever. Music plays an important role: To progress, the player must learn to play several songs on an <b>ocarina.</b> The game was responsible for increased interest in and sales of the instrument.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ocarina</b> of Times {{gameplay}} introduced {{features such}} as a target-lock system and context-sensitive buttons that have since become common in 3D adventure games. In Japan, more than 820,000 copies were sold in 1998, making it the tenth best-selling game of that year. During its lifetime, 1.14 million copies of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time were sold in Japan, and over 7.6 million copies were sold worldwide. The game won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival, and won six honors at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. , it is the highest-rated game on review-aggregating site Metacritic, with a score of 99/100; in 2008 and 2010, Guinness World Records listed <b>Ocarina</b> of Time as the highest-rated game ever reviewed. It {{is considered by many}} critics and gamers to be the greatest video game of all time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ocarina</b> of Times {{music was}} written by Koji Kondo, the {{composer}} in charge of music {{for most of the}} games in The Legend of Zelda series. In addition to characters having musical themes, areas of Hyrule are also associated with pieces of music. This has been called leitmotif in reverse—instead of music announcing an entering character, it now introduces a stationary environment as the player approaches. In some locations, the music is a variation of an <b>ocarina</b> tune the player learns, related to that area.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} <b>Ocarina</b> of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in <b>Ocarina</b> of Time, although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E

All the CD-i games in The Legend of Zelda series were released after Link's Awakening but before <b>Ocarina</b> of Time, as illustrated in the timeline with the relevant games marked with asterisks.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Majora's Mask expands on that of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time; it {{retains the}} concept of dungeon puzzles and <b>ocarina</b> songs, and introduces character transformations and a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main weapon is the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance with a bow and arrows, and destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs. He can also latch onto objects or paralyze enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, {{and the use of}} special items.|$|E
5|$|While Shigeru Miyamoto {{had been}} the {{principal}} director of Super Mario 64, he was {{now in charge of}} several directors as a producer and supervisor of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time. During its development, individual parts of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time were handled by multiple directors—a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. Four or five initial teams grew in number as needed over time, each working on different basic experiments of game design including scenario and planning, Link's actions and transforming classic 2D items into improved 3D form, camera experiments, motion capture, sound, special effects, and the flow of time. However, when progress was slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more hands-on directorial role.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of <b>Ocarina</b> of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which <b>Ocarina</b> of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ocarina</b> of Time was {{released}} to widespread critical acclaim and strong commercial success worldwide. In the United States, over 500,000 preorders were placed, more than tripling {{the number of}} preorders for any previous video game, and more than 1 million copies were sold there {{in less than a}} week. In 1998, 2.5million copies were sold, although it {{was released}} only 39 days {{before the end of the}} year; it earned $150 million in US revenues, higher than any Hollywood film in the last six weeks of 1998. In Japan, 820,000 copies were sold in 1998, becoming the tenth best-selling game of that year; a reported 386,234 copies were sold in its first week there, surpassing the 316,000 first-week sales of Metal Gear Solid. In the United Kingdom, 61,232 copies were sold during its first weekend. During its lifetime, <b>Ocarina</b> of Time saw 1.14 million copies sold in Japan, and 7.6million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 2014, Nintendo {{announced}} in its Nintendo Direct presentation that The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D {{would be released}} for the Nintendo 3DS in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2015. Like <b>Ocarina</b> of Time 3D, the remake features improved character models and stereoscopic 3D graphics, along with altered boss battles and an additional fishing minigame. A special edition featuring a pin badge, double-sided poster, and steelbook, was released in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Nintendo {{celebrated the}} game's 25th anniversary {{in a similar}} vein to the Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary celebration the {{previous}} year. This celebration included a free mailout Club Nintendo offer of the <b>Ocarina</b> of Time soundtrack to owners of the 3DS version of that particular game, the first digital for Nintendo eShop release of Link's Awakening DX, special posters that are mailed out as rewards through Club Nintendo, and a special stage inspired by the original Legend of Zelda in the video game Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, Nintendo bundled The Wind Waker {{with limited}} edition GameCubes in North America and Europe. On November 17 that year, Nintendo {{launched}} another promotion via a compilation disc, The Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition. The disc includes ports {{of the original}} Legend of Zelda, , <b>Ocarina</b> of Time, and Majora's Mask, {{as well as a}} Wind Waker demo and two featurettes. Collector's Edition was included in another GameCube bundle, and was made available to existing GameCube owners who registered their system or subscribed to Nintendo Power.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's Zelda team {{initiated}} {{plans for}} a new game early {{in the development of the}} GameCube system, before Majora's Mask was completed for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Eiji Aonuma, director of Majora's Mask, returned to helm the project, while Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka served as producers. Early concepts generally followed <b>Ocarina</b> of Times designs, with graphics enhanced for the new system's capabilities. The team hastily created a brief clip of Link fighting Ganondorf for a demonstration at the 2000 Space World exposition, where Nintendo announced the GameCube. The clip resonated with fans and commentators who hoped it previewed the next Zelda title.|$|E
50|$|For {{their music}} the Muisca used mainly flutes, drums and fotutos; musical {{instruments}} made of shells or snails. They also used <b>ocarinas.</b> The Muisca also used zampoñas and rattling cups with a pebble inside for their musical compositions.|$|R
25|$|Blowing more softly {{lowers the}} pitch; blowing harder raises it. Breath force {{can change the}} pitch by three semitones. This is why <b>ocarinas</b> {{generally}} have no tuning mechanism or dynamic range, and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play one in tune.|$|R
25|$|Several {{makers have}} {{produced}} <b>ocarinas</b> with keys, mostly experimentally, {{beginning in the}} late 19th century. Keys and slides either expand the instrument's range, help fingers reach holes that are widely spaced, or play notes not in the native key of the instrument.|$|R
