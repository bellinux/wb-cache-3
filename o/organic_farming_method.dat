40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were to determine the content of total dietary fibre (TDF) {{as well as of}} its fractions – soluble dietary fibre (SDF) and insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) of different cereals grown by conventional and organic farming in Macedonia, as well as to find out the influence of the cereal type and farming method on their values. Standardized enzymatic-gravimetric method (Megazyme Total Dietary Fiber Kit) was used for determination of soluble, insoluble, and total dietary fiber in 27 different cereal samples of wheat, rye, barley, oat, and millet, which were grown at three locations. The content of TDF, IDF and SDF was influenced by both cereal type and farming type. The organically grown cereals, primarily oat and barley, have shown higher values of TDF and of its fractions than the conventionally grown cereals. Their values (% db) for oat and barley for TDF were 42. 00 ± 1. 39 and 21. 91 ± 2. 01, for IDF 39. 22 ± 0. 58 and 15. 06 ± 1. 84 and for SDF 2. 78 ± 1. 25 and 6. 85 ± 3. 85, respectively. Barley grown by either organic or in conversion farming method proved to have the highest value of SDF content among the other cereals investigated, whereas oat produced by <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> exhibited the highest values of TDF and ISF content.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted {{for four years}} {{to determine the effects}} of organic and conventional systems and fourteen varieties (nine old and five improved) on growth, yield and quality of durum wheat crop. The experiments conducted at two sites (low semi-arid and higher semi-arid) were laid out in a split-plot design with four replicates. Studied parameters included (i) grain yield, (ii) technological and nutritional quality of the whole grain, dry matter, specific weight, proteins, amino acids, mineral content, gluten and baking strength. Results of the agronomic traits indicated that grain yield is on the average lower under organic cultivation compared to conventional methods (2. 32 and 2. 98 t/ha SEM= 0. 18 qx/ha respectively).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential of different durum wheat varieties that could be adapted for organic farming. In this context, four experimental years studies (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) were carried out in order to assess fourteen durum wheat varieties including nine old and five improved varieties conducted under organic and conventional cultivation methods and in two cereal growing locations : Kef "Boulifa" : low semi-arid and Bousalem “El Kodia” : higher semi-arid. Studied parameters included (i) grain yield, (ii) yield stability using coefficient of variation, linear regression coefficient, deviations from regression, ecovalence of Wricke, ecovalence of Shukla, ecovalence of Plaisted and Peterson and superiority index of Lin and Binns, (iii) technological and nutritional quality of the whole grain, dry matter, specific weight, proteins, amino acids, mineral content, gluten, amylasic activity and baking strength. Results of the agronomic traits indicated that grain yield is on the average lower under organic cultivation compared to conventional methods (23. 2 and 29. 8 qx/ha SEM= 0. 18 qx/ha respectively).

40|$|The {{interest}} {{aroused by}} consumers stimulated {{the development of}} an experimental project to produce a seasoning named “Agresto” in the specific area of Amiata mountain with the aim of affirming the territorial specificities of a natural product derived from unripe grapes obtained from local grapevine varieties to enhance their use in gastronomy. With this project, we intend to adopt several strategies in the vineyard and in processing, in order to obtain a final product from grapes cultivated by "organic farming", having sensory characteristics suitable for various types of dish combinations. For this purpose were chosen two local varieties (‘Nera Giannelli’, ‘Bianco peloso’) grown in the ampelographic collection located in Cinigiano (Gr) and the hybrid ‘Isabella’ from which were obtained three experimental “agresto”. In the same year was also produced from ‘Sangiovese’ a "traditional agresto" according to an ancient recipe. The variety ‘Isabella’ is grown sporadically without pesticide treatments, while the other varieties were cultivated according to the <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> <b>method.</b> Moreover the “agresto” is produced without alcoholic fermentation, so as the final product is free from methyl alcohol. The goal is to get to the production of a unique and genuine seasoning through natural methods and without preservatives. The analysis of “agresto”, indicate elevated contents of organic acids and catechins, expressing also interesting sensory profiles that were obtained using a parametric sheet specially adapted to this type of product. The traditional “agresto” currently marketed in very modest amounts, remains a niche product, particularly required by Tuscany kitchen.

50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> combine {{scientific}} knowledge of ecology and modern technology with traditional farming practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. <b>Organic</b> <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> are {{studied in the}} field of agroecology. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is pyrethrin, which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower. The principal <b>methods</b> of <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> include crop rotation, green manures and compost, biological pest control, and mechanical cultivation. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: legumes are planted to fix nitrogen into the soil, natural insect predators are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as potassium bicarbonate and mulches are used to control disease and weeds. Genetically modified seeds and animals are excluded.|$|R

Conventional soil management alters the composition of the soil microbial community. Organic management with an emphasis on compost application is able to restore the soil microbial community and its functions in a short time span of two years.
