5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E

40|$|Experiences {{of nature}} {{contribute}} {{to human health}} and well-being, yet as the world 2 ̆ 7 s population continues to concentrate in towns and cities there is mounting concern that these experiences are diminishing. Despite this, {{little is known about}} how we can maintain experiences of nature as cities grow. Here, we quantify how people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> nature might change with future urban growth in the city of Brisbane, Australia. We simulated the addition of 84, 642 houses under compact and sprawling growth scenarios and modeled changes in people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> nature by estimating changes in backyard size, public green space provision, and bird species richness close to households. We discovered that the form of urban growth could strongly influence people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> nature {{in a way that is}} highly nonrandom across the socioeconomic gradient. Under a sprawling pattern of development, with low residential densities and few interstitial green spaces, our models suggest severe declines in access to public green space and bird species richness around people 2 ̆ 7 s homes. These declines are predicted to be concentrated in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of the city. Compact development leads to greater reductions in backyard size, but smaller declines in access to public green space and bird species richness. Our results point to a difficult trade-off; residential infill will maintain larger green spaces and higher overall bird diversity but reduce backyard sizes, impacting people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> nature in a different way. Careful planning is needed to balance the availability of public and private urban green spaces to ensure that the <b>opportunities</b> for people <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> nature are maintained as urbanization continues...|$|R

500|$|... "Coming of Age" [...] {{examines}} Gethenian {{sexuality in}} greater detail than in Left Hand. In describing the story, Le Guin stated: It seemed high time we got {{all the way into}} a kemmerhouse.

Left Hand gives the reader very little <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back in 1968, I and most readers needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the strangeness. I don't think we do, now. She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand.|$|E

500|$|In November 1952 he {{appointed}} Harold Wyndham as the Director-General of Education, and commissioned him to chair a committee tasked to completely review the Secondary education system in New South Wales and make recommendations for improvements. The committee's report, popularly {{referred to as}} [...] "The Wyndham Report", was presented to Heffron in October 1957 and {{gave rise to the}} Public Education Act of 1961, being brought into effect in 1962, during Heffron's term as Premier. Key amongst the changes was the objective of presenting all students with the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a wide range of subjects, including visual arts, industrial arts, music and drama, and a wide range of languages. The five-year secondary school system was abandoned in favour of adding another year to the course, with major statewide external examinations {{at the end of the}} tenth (School Certificate) and the twelfth (Higher School Certificate) years of schooling.|$|E
500|$|Development for [...]hack {{began in}} early 2000 {{with the aim}} of {{shocking}} and surprising the player and creating a distinctive product. CyberConnect2's president Hiroshi Matsuyama {{played a key role in}} developing the concept for the series. A number of core ideas, including [...] "slaying dragons or being a thief in London" [...] were explored, but these were rejected in favor of an [...] "offline/online game". Matsuyama said that this would give young gamers an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> online play without paying monthly fees or needing powerful Internet connections. The developers looked at a number of MMORPGs such as Phantasy Star Online, Ultima Online, and Final Fantasy XI for inspiration, and drew influences from the prior works of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Neon Genesis Evangelion) and scenario writer Kazunori Itō (Ghost in the Shell). Itō noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of The World creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Brian Peterson, where Clark brings [...] "angst" [...] and [...] "depth" [...] to his {{relationship}} with Lana, Jason is designed to bring [...] "joy", [...] "levity", and [...] "fun". On the topic of Jason's relationship with Lana, Ackles believes the character did love Lana, because he saw an innocence in her {{that had not been}} able to experience growing up in the upper class society; Jason grew up having to question the actions of his mother, and with Lana he had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> an honest relationship. Ackles was Gough and Millar's first choice to play Jason Teague, as the actor had been the runner up for the role of Clark Kent when they were casting for the pilot. Ackles was contracted to remain through season five, but was written out of the show in the season four finale, which, according to Ackles, was due to his commitments to the WB's new series Supernatural. Gough contends that Supernatural did not alter any of their plans, and that Jason Teague was intended to be a single season character.|$|E
