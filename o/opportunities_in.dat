30|$|Our {{analysis}} of inequality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>in</b> {{the labor market}} so far is based on discrete outcomes. But the literature offers ways to analyze and decompose inequality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>in</b> continuous variables. We use one such method proposed and implemented by Ferreira et al. (2011) to assess the degree of inequality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>in</b> Turkey. The key question we want to ask is how our measure of the inequality of <b>opportunity</b> <b>in</b> the labor market – as defined by employment in certain types of jobs – compares with inequality of opportunity measures derived from income (or its proxies).|$|R

5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading <b>opportunities</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse.

The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece.|$|E
