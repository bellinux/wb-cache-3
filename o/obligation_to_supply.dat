In lieu of extant specified property rights, participants were invited <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> provide groundwater recharge credits {{in exchange for}} pecuniary compensation. Participants were able <b>to</b> meet their <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> groundwater recharge credits through land management actions resulting in monitored outcomes consistent with contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> reduce recharge. Alternatively, those in deficit were provided the option to obtain sufficient credits through market exchange. Surplus transferable recharge credits were produced by those participants who exceeded their own contractual obligations through improved land management. The paper describes the process of contract design and implementation. The trial involved a design and testing phase and an on-ground implementation phase. We describe composite methodologies deployed {{in the design and}} testing of alternative policy instruments and institutional arrangements, conducted prior to implementation. These involved community consultation, an attitudinal and behavioural survey, experimental economics {{and the development of a}} transparent and credible monitoring protocol. The conclusions drawn as a result of this analysis provided an empirical basis to implement the on-ground trial phase. Results of on-ground implementation are described. Finally, the methods and results of a Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the on-ground trial implementation are outlined. The BCA accounted for salinity damage reduction, forgone river flow, carbon sequestration, production benefits and costs. The result of BCA was an estimated net benefit.

40|$|Water service {{providers}} (WSPs) in the UK have statutory <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> drinking water <b>to</b> all customers that complies with increasingly stringent water quality egulations and minimum flow and pressure criteria. At the same time, {{the industry is}} required by egulators and investors to demonstrate increasing operational efficiency and to meet {{a wide range of}} performance criteria that are expected to improve year-on-year. Most WSPs have an ideal for improving the operation of their water supply systems based on increased knowledge and understanding of their assets and a shift to proactive management followed by steadily increasing degrees of system monitoring, utomation and optimisation. The fundamental mission is, however, to ensure security of supply, with no interruptions and water quality of the highest standard at the tap. Unfortunately, advanced technologies required to fully understand, manage and automate water supply system operation either do not yet exist, are only partially evolved, or have not yet been reliably proven for live water distribution systems. It is this deficiency that the project NEPTUNE seeks to address by carrying out research into 3 main areas; these are: data and knowledge management; pressure management (including energy management); and the associated complex decision support systems on which to base interventions. The 3 -year project started in April of 2007 and has already resulted in a number of research findings under the three main research priority areas (RPA).

50|$|The central {{feature of}} the Roman army of the mid-Republic, or the Polybian army, was the manipular {{organization}} of its battle-line. Instead of a single, large mass (the phalanx) as in the Early Roman army, the Romans now drew up in three lines consisting of small units (maniples) of 120 men, arrayed in chessboard fashion, giving much greater tactical strength and flexibility. This structure was probably introduced in c. 300 BC during the Samnite Wars. Also probably dating from this period was the regular accompaniment of each legion by a non-citizen formation of roughly equal size, the ala, recruited from Rome's Italian allies, or socii. The latter were c. 150 autonomous states which were bound by a treaty of perpetual military alliance with Rome.

5000|$|Manchester fielded a {{legal team}} headed by Sir Edmund Beckett QC, a leading {{practitioner}} at the parliamentary bar: they called witnesses {{to make the}} case for the scheme. Manchester waterworks supplied an area containing 800,000 inhabitants, about 380,000 of whom lived within the city boundary. In dry summers, the water supply had to be cut off at night to conserve stocks. In 1868, admittedly before the works in Longendale were complete, this had happened for 75 days. [...] Water consumption was about 22 gallons a day per person, but it was that low because Manchester had discouraged water-closets and baths in working-class housingThe waterworks did not make a profit; by Act of Parliament the total water rate could not exceed 10d per pound rental within the city; 12d in the supplied area outside the city (to have equal rates would be unfair to the rate payers who stood as guarantors for very large capital expenditure) Manchester was not profiteering from its present water supply, nor was it out to profit from the scheme: it would accept whatever <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> areas along the aqueduct route (and/or price cap on sales outside the city) the committee saw fit to impose. There was no possibility of adding further reservoirs in Longendale and no suitable unclaimed sites south of the Lune; the headwaters of the Lune were in limestone country, making both water quality (soft water was preferred by domestic customers and needed for textile processing) and reservoir construction problematical. [...] Thirlmere water was exceptionally pure whereas water pumped from the sandstone even when drinkable generally had considerable permanent hardnessTaking water from Ullswater rather than Thirlmere would cost about £370,000 more. Thirlmere had higher rainfall than Longendale(even in the driest year, 72 inches should be expected) and (by raising the water level) storage sufficient to allow the supply of fifty million gallons a day through any reasonably sustained drought: the reliable supply from Longendale was only half that. The aqueduct to Manchester would (at different points on its route) be a tunnel through rock, a buried culvert constructed by cut-and-cover, or cast-iron pipes (for example where the aqueduct crossed a river, it would normally do so by an inverted syphon in pipes). Five 40-inch diameter pipes would be provided to take the full fifty million gallons per day, but initially only one pipe would be laid - others would be added as demand increased.The former secretary of the Duke of Richmond's Royal Commission gave evidence of the scheme they had considered, which involved raising the level of Thirlmere 64 feet. Examination of the area around the outlet showed that Thirlmere had previously overflowed at a level 65 feet higher than at present. Hence [...] "it would only be necessary to dam up the present outlet ... to raise the lake to its original level"; were this done [...] "the lake when filled will be more in keeping with the grandeur of the hills around" [...] Variations in reservoir water level would only expose a gravel or shingle shore (as happened now with natural fluctuations in level): there was nothing in the water to support the formation of mudbanks. The Commission had thought it would be unreasonable for London to take water from the Lakes without considering the needs of the industrial North; it had remarked favourably on Manchester supplying nearby towns as an instance of how by combination small towns might secure a better supply than they could by their own efforts. The same principle applied to supplying towns on the route of the aqueduct.|$|E
