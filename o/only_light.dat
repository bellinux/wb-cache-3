Marines met with <b>only</b> <b>light</b> resistance from 30 Japanese soldiers there, and two prisoners were brought to Maryland. On 7 December, Maryland left Apamama Island for Pearl Harbor. After a brief stopover there, Maryland left for San Francisco for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie was a weak storm {{through most}} of its path, {{dropping}} <b>only</b> <b>light</b> rainfall and causing minimal damage. South Carolina and North Carolina experienced {{the worst of the}} storm, where a tornado outbreak killed three people and caused moderate damage.|$|E

5|$|MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer {{assigned}} the script to Donald Ogden Stewart—one {{of his favorite}} screenwriters. Mayer's choice seemed unusual, because {{up to that time}} Stewart had written <b>only</b> <b>light</b> romantic comedies featuring wealthy East Coast socialites, but Mayer felt Stewart's strongly leftist political leanings would enable him to chalk out a better screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate <b>only</b> <b>light</b> pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Sumiyoshi's forces, {{including}} two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Nomasu Nakaguma, launched {{attacks on the}} U.S. Marine defenses {{at the mouth of}} the Matanikau on the evening of 23 October. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the assaults and killed many of the attacking Japanese soldiers while suffering <b>only</b> <b>light</b> casualties to themselves.|$|E

5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. <b>Only</b> <b>light</b> at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|A light {{storm surge}} of 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) was {{reported}} along the northeast Florida coast into southeastern Georgia. The storm's outer rainbands dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) across coastal Florida, northward to North Carolina. A station on Bermuda reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h), with gusts to 78 mph (126 km/h). <b>Only</b> <b>light</b> damage {{occurred on the}} island.|$|E
5|$|After {{occupation}} {{duty in the}} Hollandia area, the 24th Division {{was assigned}} to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army {{in preparation for the}} invasion of the Philippines. On 20 October 1944, the division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps, and the two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte, initially encountering <b>only</b> <b>light</b> resistance. Following a defeat at sea on 26 October, the Japanese launched a large, uncoordinated counteroffensive against the Sixth Army. The 24th Division drove up the Leyte Valley, advanced to Jaro and captured Breakneck Ridge on 12 November 1944, in heavy fighting.|$|E
50|$|In early 2017, Camden {{completed}} a city project {{that consisted of}} installing energy efficient street lights along Exit 98 of the I-20 corridor, making it the <b>only</b> <b>lighted</b> exit on I-20 between Florence and Columbia.|$|R

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Debby slowly weakened, and {{was between}} Category2 and 1 when it passed south of Newfoundland early on September19. Thereafter, the storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60mph (95km/h) towards the east. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September20, shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact was minor in the Lesser Antilles, with <b>only</b> <b>light</b> to moderate rainfall in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. On Bermuda, high winds caused some power outages and knocked over trees, though {{damage on the}} island was minimal. In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{initially}} posed {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} Lesser Antilles which had already suffered severe damages from Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Several watches and warnings were issued for the islands between August26 and 27; however, due to the northward turn, Gustav did not directly impact the region. <b>Only</b> <b>light</b> rain and large swells were reported. Offshore, a ship encountered the storm and sustained hull damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{panic in}} Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault with fresh forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 {{from the north}} and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered <b>only</b> <b>light</b> resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of {{a large part of the}} second line of Polish defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Tropical Storm Danielle and a ridge of high pressure to its north produced moderately strong winds across eastern North Carolina, peaking at 58mph (93km/h) at Alligator River Bridge. Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds. The {{pressure gradient}} also produced {{higher than normal}} waves along the coastline, with a maximum of 20feet (6m) at Duck. Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped <b>only</b> <b>light</b> rainfall, totaling to 0.2inches (5mm) at Cape Hatteras. However, locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1inch (25mm) of rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Fabian was a {{short-lived}} tropical storm during the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. The sixth named storm of the year, it {{formed in the}} northwest Caribbean southwest of Cuba. The storm reached a peak intensity of 45mph (75km/h), shortly before crossing over Cuba as it moved northeast past Florida. Fabian became extratropical north of the Bahamas the next day, and dissipated on October 17. Fabian caused <b>only</b> <b>light</b> rainfall along its path {{and there were no}} reported fatalities or damage.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{minutes of}} brutal, close-quarters fighting, {{the two sides}} broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of Helena and senior {{surviving}} U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage. Admiral Abe had one battleship (Kirishima), one light cruiser (Nagara), and four destroyers (Asagumo, Teruzuki, Yukikaze, and Harusame) with <b>only</b> <b>light</b> damage and four destroyers (Inazuma, Ikazuchi, Murasame, and Samidare) with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (Helena) and one destroyer (Fletcher) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.|$|E
60|$|That {{night the}} three boys climbed several tall {{rocks in the}} {{vicinity}} of their camp and looked around with care. But the <b>only</b> <b>lights</b> that they could make out were miles away, and those Abe Blower stated were on the distant railroad. Nothing like a campfire came to view.|$|R
60|$|As the Baron fell, {{he struck}} heavily upon a table which {{supported}} the <b>only</b> <b>lighted</b> cresset within the chamber. In an instant, all was darkness. There was a rapid shuffling sound {{as of the}} scurrying of rats and then the quiet of the tomb settled upon the great hall.|$|R
50|$|St. Andrew's has no tower; only a bell-turret. It has one bell, {{which was}} cast in 1636 by Ellis I Knight of Reading, Berkshire. The church has no running water or electricity; its <b>only</b> <b>lighting</b> is from candles mounted on 18th century brackets. the church is a Grade I listed building.|$|R
5|$|At 0730 the 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade and the 46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, {{supported}} by the 31st Tank Brigade moved off their start lines behind a rolling barrage fired from 344 guns. The 46th Brigade initially advanced without armoured support, because in bypassing the mine and booby trap-ridden village of Le Mesnil-Patry, its tanks were forced to negotiate minefields flanking the village. The 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders faced <b>only</b> <b>light</b> resistance, while the 9th Battalion The Cameronians, ran into the grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division, who had allowed the barrage to pass over their positions before opening fire. Reuniting with their tanks at around 1000, by midday the two battalions were fighting for control of their initial objectives; Cheux and Le Haut du Bosq.|$|E
5|$|Both Major General Wayne C. Smith and Lieutenant General Chung Il-kwon, {{commanders of}} the US 7th Infantry Division and the ROK 2nd Infantry Division respectively, {{relieved}} exhausted battalions daily to maintain troops' morale. On October 15, Smith ordered the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment {{to be placed}} {{under the command of}} Colonel Moses to resume the attack on Triangle Hill. Similarly, Chung Il-kwon replaced the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment with the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment. Later that day both US battalions captured Hill 598 and Sandy Ridge after meeting <b>only</b> <b>light</b> resistance, but the Chinese tunnels and a counterattack by the PVA 135th Regiment prevented the Americans from advancing towards Pike's Peak and Jane Russell Hill. The South Koreans, on the other hand, were thrown back by a Chinese counterattack after recapturing Sniper Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind. They brought <b>only</b> <b>light</b> armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.|$|E
