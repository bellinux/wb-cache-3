He learned gambling and boxing while working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> head in the Wyoming Territory. Earp developed a reputation officiating boxing matches and refereed a fight in front of 3000 spectators between John Shanssey and Mike Donovan on July 4, 1869, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network. Guards {{were removed}} from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E

5|$|Elstow first {{formed in}} the area known as Lakeview. Administrative affairs were handled from 1905 to 1909 by the Local Improvement District #17-A3 and then by rural {{municipality}} Blucher No. 343. The station of Fountain was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line and Provincial Highway 14 in 1907. Lanigan received steel in 1907. Lanigan was a CPR junction point and five rail lines served the area from Lanigan, as well as Provincial highway 14 (the Yellowhead) and Hwy 20. Humboldt and Watson were served to the north, and Nokomis to the south {{as well as the}} main Saskatoon Winnipeg line. The rail came to Wynyard in 1909, and three years later the area incorporated as a town. Wynyard was the CPR divisional point.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell {{also stated that}} spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail {{has gone too far}} to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{last eight}} trains were ordered in 2002 and {{delivered}} in 2004–2006, finalising the fleet of 18 trains. At that point {{it had become}} clear that the speed limits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network were mostly too low for the trains to run at their maximum operating speed, {{even though they were}} chosen specifically to prevent the costly work of straightening existing lines. Work on lines has continued, and, on modernised lines, the speed difference between the Pendolino and non-tilting trains has become minimal. The Sm3 was able to attain its maximum operating speed in regular traffic only in 2006, when a new rail line was opened between Kerava and Lahti and the full Pendolino fleet was available. Seven of the original 23 options never came to be.|$|E

5|$|There were {{no changes}} in the front line after January 21 {{as a result of}} Operation Iskra. The Soviet forces were unable to advance any further, and instead started fortifying the area to thwart any German attempt at re-establishing the blockade. On January 22, work started <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line linking Leningrad {{to the rest of the}} country through the {{captured}} corridor. The plan from the GKO written on January 18, ordered the construction to be finished in 20 days. The work was completed ahead of schedule and trains began delivering supplies on February 6, 1943. The operation officially ended on January 30.|$|E
5|$|Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer {{created the}} track layout and {{operations}} for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the Allies during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for U.S. Steel. Vilmer designed {{the operations of the}} DRR {{in such a way that}} each of its two trains would be assigned to a single station <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line, making only complete round trips possible. The Retlaw 1 passenger train pulled by the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with sidings at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even if the other train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along the full length of its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.|$|E
5|$|Several {{men of the}} {{regiment}} were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system. The two commanding officers, Mackesy and McCarroll, were invested as Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, and as Companions of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). McCarroll also received a bar for the DSO to signify a second award. While Mackesy was also invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Two other men also received a DSO both majors, Herrold for the raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line at Amman and Ralph Wyman at Gallipoli. There were two civilian awards, of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and a Member of the Order of the British Empire. The Military Cross was awarded to eight officers; two men received bars for a second award. The other ranks were awarded six Distinguished Conduct Medals, and sixteen Military Medals. There were also twenty-six men Mentioned in Dispatches for all ranks.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
