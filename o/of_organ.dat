5|$|In France, as in Italy, Spain and Portugal, organs were {{primarily}} designed to play alternatim verses rather than accompany congregational singing.

5|$|In the 20th-century symphonic repertoire, both {{sacred and}} secular, {{continued}} to {{progress through the}} music of Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé, and Herbert Howells. Other composers, such as Olivier Messiaen, György Ligeti, Jehan Alain, Jean Langlais, Gerd Zacher, and Petr Eben, wrote post-tonal organ music. Messiaen's music in particular redefined many of the traditional notions <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> registration and technique.|$|E
5|$|The main {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> repertoire {{has progressed}} {{along with that}} of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because organs are commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ repertoire includes a large amount of sacred music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for alternatim use, etc.). The organ's secular repertoire includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.|$|E

5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> function.|$|E

Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> rejection.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the LP record, Saint-Saëns's works were patchily {{represented}} on disc. The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre, The Carnival of the Animals, the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works. In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> music, and choral songs. A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} marketed and {{sold by the}} Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians in organ trios, a small group centered on the Hammond organ. Organ trios were hired by jazz club owners, who found that organ trios were a much cheaper alternative to hiring a big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock, and reggae, {{as well as being}} an important instrument in progressive rock.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E
5|$|Towson United Methodist Church has a 3-manual, 48-rank Casavant {{pipe organ}} of 2,790pipes, {{including}} seven ranks of 16ft. pipes and tubular chimes. It was dedicated {{in memory of}} S. Clayton Seitz by then-organist John Duwane Hoffman on May 11, 1958. Hoffman, the church's esteemed virtuoso organist and Minister of Music between 19571988, {{was a graduate of}} Union Theological Seminary's renowned Master of Sacred Music degree program, after having earned Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees at the University of Denver. At Union, Hoffman studied the organ with Clarence Dickinson and Vernon De Tar. In addition to serving as the church's organist and choral director, Hoffman was professor <b>of</b> <b>organ</b> at Towson State University. He died unexpectedly on July 4, 1988 of complications following heart bypass surgery. The church library is named in his memory. Hoffman was succeeded by Kathie Metz, a graduate of Marshall University, as Director of Music and Organist 19882012. The current Director of Music and Organist since July, 2013, is Douglas Hollida. An ordained minister, Rev. Hollida studied music at Shepherd University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and then earned a Master of Divinity degree from Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry. World-famous concert organists who have performed at the church's organ include Pierre Cochereau, Flor Peeters, and Marilyn Mason.|$|E
