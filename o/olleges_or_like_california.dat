40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, 1997 Note: this {{electronic}} version {{lacks the}} VHS video. Extinction rates {{of plants and}} animals are currently far in excess of speciation rates. Greatly increased rates of biological invasions, especially species introduced by humans, are a major factor in this mass extinction. Public awareness about this global impoverishment and homogenization of species and ecosystems must be greatly elevated <b>or</b> places <b>like</b> <b>California</b> will lose much of the living natural heritage which make them unique. I produced a 25 -minute informational video for the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR, state parks). Plant Invaders: A Threat to California's Remnant Natural Areas covers the topic of biological invasions in general and invasive plants in particular. The primary target audience is state parks personnel. The video seeks to educate park personnel and the public about the scope of this problem and why it is important that efforts be redoubled to protect and restore parks and other remnant natural areas...|$|R
