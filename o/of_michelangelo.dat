5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo.</b> John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo,</b> but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which {{he spent in}} Northern Italy studying the great works <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo,</b> Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. During this period he also visited Paris, {{took advantage of the}} timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Already {{a friend}} of the {{composer}} Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo,</b> the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E

25|$|His {{uncle was}} a member of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia and a close friend <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> Castelli, the {{secretary}} of Camillo Benso di Cavour.

25|$|Vasari praised Michelangelo's {{seemingly}} infinite {{powers of}} invention in creating postures for the figures. Raphael, who {{was given a}} preview by Bramante after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino {{and the other in}} the Vatican, his portrait <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> himself in The School of Athens.|$|E
25|$|Cavalieri {{was born}} in Rome of an aristocratic and musical family.

He spent much of his time in Rome as an organiser of Lenten oratorios. While in Rome he became associated with Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici.|$|E

25|$|A {{technique}} {{used in the}} popular frescoes <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> and Raphael was to scrape indentations into {{certain areas of the}} plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others. The eyes {{of the people of the}} School of Athens are sunken-in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pensive. Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark 'outlining' of his central figures within his frescoes.|$|E
25|$|This fresco {{depicts a}} meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, {{gathered}} in a grand classical setting around the central figure of Plato, whom Raphael has famously modelled upon Leonardo da Vinci. The brooding figure of Heraclitus who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo,</b> and is {{a reference to the}} latter's painting of the Prophet Jeremiah in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.|$|E
25|$|In Rotman he {{also started}} {{working in the}} circle <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> and befriended him.

Michelangelo also provided him with sketches on which Daniele based some of his paintings, especially his series of frescoes in the Orsini chapel in the Trinity College, the commission for which Daniele had received in December 1541.|$|E

25|$|Raphael had {{the good}} luck to be born {{the son of a}} painter, so his career path, unlike that <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian {{workshop}} of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the Betrothal of the Virgin, which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's Christ giving the Keys to Peter.|$|E
25|$|A keen {{student of}} the {{architecture}} <b>of</b> <b>Michelangelo</b> and the ruins of Antiquity, Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive, if somewhat idiosyncratic, architecture employing manipulations of Classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings. He {{seems to have had}} a sound understanding of structures, which perhaps Bernini and Cortona, who were principally trained {{in other areas of the}} visual arts, lacked. His soft lead drawings are particularly distinctive. He appears to have been a self-taught scholar, amassing a large library by the end of his life.|$|E
25|$|The Merchant of Four Seasons uses melodrama as a {{style to}} create {{critical}} studies of contemporary German {{life for a}} general audience.

It is also his first realization of what he learned from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and their emotions, however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.|$|E
