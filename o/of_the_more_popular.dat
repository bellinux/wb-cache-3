5|$|No {{records of}} the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> cat breeds in the world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, amateur and {{professional}} wrestling enjoyed widespread popularity in New Zealand popular culture. Part of this of was due to its radio broadcasts from live events both prior to and after the war. By 1956, professional wrestling had surpassed the then-national sport of rugby in popularity and {{was the most popular}} spectator sport in New Zealand with the exception of horse racing. The Wellington Town Hall Concert Chamber was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> postwar venues for wrestling events. Within a few years, New Zealand champions were traveling oversees as far as Western Canada.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman Republic of the 1st century, gladiatorial {{games were}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> forms of entertainment. In order to supply gladiators for the contests, several {{training}} schools, or ludi, were established throughout Italy. In these schools, {{prisoners of war}} and condemned criminals—who were considered slaves—were taught the skills required to fight in gladiatorial games. In 73 BC, a group of some 200 gladiators in the Capuan school owned by Lentulus Batiatus plotted an escape. When their plot was betrayed, a force of about 70 men seized kitchen implement ("choppers and spits"), fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> areas around Mount Adams. The area {{is made up}} of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E

Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue Stilton.

5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Saluki in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has remained relatively stable over the past decade, with the breed ranked 107th in 1999, had decreased to 118th in 2008, but by 2008 had increased once again to 112th. Between 2000 and 2009, 1215 Salukis were registered with The Kennel Club in the UK, while this does not approach the numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> breeds, it {{is in line with}} similar breeds in the Hound Group such as the Borzoi, which had 1399 puppies registered in the same period. In September 2007, The Kennel Club Art Gallery's 12th exhibition celebrated the Saluki, The Saluki in Art showed a range of exhibits including terracotta and bronze works, along with contemporary artists and a range of trophies from Saluki breed clubs.|$|E

Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>popular</b> dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E
