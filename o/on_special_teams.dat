5|$|<b>On</b> <b>special</b> <b>teams,</b> the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies within striking distance, but failures <b>on</b> <b>special</b> <b>teams</b> also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998.

50|$|Most <b>special</b> <b>teams</b> {{are made}} up of players who act as backups or {{substitutes}} on the team's offensive and defensive units.

5|$|Although he was {{eligible}} to declare for the CFL Draft, Aidoo chose {{to remain with}} the Marauders for the 2002 season, citing a desire to further recover from his leg injury.
