5|$|Before {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> {{geostationary}} satellite coverage in 1966, {{the number of}} eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a formal model <b>of</b> the <b>reliable</b> {{multicast}} service that ensures eventual packet delivery with, possibly, some timeliness guarantees. This model dictates precisely {{what it means to}} be a member <b>of</b> the <b>reliable</b> multicast group and which packets are guaranteed delivery to which members of the group. Moreover, it is reasonable, implementable, and broad; that is, it captures the intended behavior <b>of</b> numerous <b>reliable</b> multicast protocols. We also present a formal model <b>of</b> the Scalable <b>Reliable</b> Multicast (SRM) protocol [1]. We show that our model of SRM is safe, in the sense that it is a faithful implementation of our model <b>of</b> the <b>reliable</b> multicast service; that is, it may only deliver appropriate packets to each member <b>of</b> the <b>reliable</b> multicast group. We also show that, under certain constraints, the implementation is live, in the sense that it guarantees the timely delivery of the appropriate packets to the appropriate members <b>of</b> the <b>reliable</b> multicast group. ...|$|R

5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E

5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6â€“10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occursâ€”within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|General Hay {{initially}} portrayed Ong Thanh as an American {{victory and}} cited 101 enemy {{dead in the}} battle. However, American veterans who survived the ordeals of the battle were adamant they were ambushed and defeated by the Viet Cong's 271st Regiment. The estimate of 101 enemy dead officially provided by the U.S. military was likely much inflated to emphasize {{the scale of the}} 'American victory'. For retired U.S. Army Brigadier General James E. Shelton, who was then a major and served as an Operations Officer with the 2nd Battalion, the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> intelligence and overconfidence on the part of Allen as the battalion commander, were some of the factors that led to the disastrous outcome in the Ong Thanh battle. Furthermore, the American soldiers under Allen's command lacked fighting experience, whereas the Viet Cong soldiers of the 9th Division were tough and experienced light infantry. The Viet Cong 271st Regiment, after their victory at Ong Thanh, withdrew back towards their base area near the Cambodian border.|$|E

Although the storm was an unprecedented event, Brazilian officials took the appropriate actions and warned {{the public about the}} approaching storm. Residents heeded the warnings and prepared for the storm by either evacuating or by riding it out in their homes. Catarina ended up destroying 1,500 homes and damaging around 40,000 others. Agricultural products were severely damaged: 85% of the banana crops and 40% of the rice crops were lost in the storm. Three people were confirmed to have perished in the storm and 185 others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to $350 million (2004 USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{preserved}} hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir {{is contained}} in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 {{in the town of}} Bar, then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, who was probably of Czech origin. He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the VojislavljeviÄ‡ dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty; they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir. The VojislavljeviÄ‡s succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> historical data. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography. Chapters 1â€“33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the 1827 North Carolina {{hurricane}} is unclear in the absence <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> data across the Atlantic Ocean, but it is surmised the storm began as a classic Cape Verde hurricane. On a west-northwest track, the hurricane moved through the Lesser Antilles on August17 and August18, grazing the coastline of Hispaniola the following day. It reached the Turks and Caicos Islands on August20 and the Bahamas on August21, subsequently curving northward east of Florida and South Carolina a few days later. On August25, the storm â€“ {{thought to have been}} as strong as Category4 strength on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale â€“ moved ashore along the North Carolina coastline. Its exact landfall point remains unclear, with one study suggesting a landfall along the Outer Banks, and a second study concluding a landfall along the Carolinas border on the basis of surface observations from Wilmington, North Carolina. Nonetheless, the storm then turned northeast and emerged into the Atlantic around Norfolk, Virginia. It grazed the New England coastline before being last documented around Sable Island offshore Nova Scotia on August28.|$|E
