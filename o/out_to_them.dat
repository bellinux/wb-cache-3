5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E

On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E
5|$|On {{an episode}} of Colt Cabana's Art of Wrestling podcast {{released}} in November 2014, Punk broke his silence regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk {{said that he was}} suspended for two months after walking out on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. He also told that when he reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE, there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

She is rescued when Jocasta alerts the Avengers to her location, and Black Panther suggests that the A.I.'s ability to reach <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> was brought about because of Janet's personality breaking through.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the attack}} {{the storm had}} {{continued}} and the rain had poured down, {{so that it was}} no small comfort to the weary soldiers when Jean Francois pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the storehouse, where they all obtained dry clothes, and where a ration of bread and wine with lard and pork was served out to each of them. Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Menéndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonnière from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonnière had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> {{to lock the}} doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
25|$|The first passage {{has been}} {{interpreted}} both literally, allegorically and otherwise. Although some commentators feel that this passage referred to a physical miracle, where Abraham was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven (Jannah), others have felt that {{it refers to the}} spiritual understanding of Abraham; these latter scholars maintain that the Chaldeans were skilled in the observance of the stars, but Abraham, who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the Qur'anic commentators, that Abraham took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> each piece joined and four birds flew back to Abraham. This miracle, as told by the Qur'anic passage, was a demonstration by God to show Abraham how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show Abraham the power God has to raise the dead to life. The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the 'fire' refers to main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which Abraham was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the 'fire of persecution', from which Abraham was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.|$|E

500|$|The {{object was}} soon universally {{accepted}} as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: [...] "By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe {{it appears that the}} new star, which I had the honour of pointing <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System." [...] In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of £200 on condition that he move to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was {{fiercely}} {{proud of}} Louis Lambert {{and believed that}} it elegantly represented his diverse interests in philosophy, mysticism, religion, and occultism. When he sent an early draft to his lover at the time, however, she predicted the negative reception it would receive. [...] "Let the whole world see you for themselves, my dearest," [...] she wrote, [...] "but do not cry <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> to admire you, because then the most powerful magnifying glasses will be directed at you, and what becomes of the most exquisite object when it is put under a microscope?" [...] Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, due mostly to the book's lack of sustaining narrative. Conservative commentator Eugène Poitou, on the other hand, accused Balzac of lacking true faith and portraying the French family as a vile institution.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{lasts for}} two to three months, {{following}} which a litter of one to four kittens is born. Births take place in secluded areas, for example in dense vegetation or burrows abandoned by aardvarks and porcupines. Blind at birth, newborn weigh nearly [...] and have soft, woolly hair (greyer than in adults) and unclear markings. The eyes open after nine to thirteen days. Weaning begins after a month of birth; the mother brings small kills to her kittens and calls <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as she approaches the [...] "den". A mother with young kittens rests for a notably lesser time and has to spend almost twice the time and energy for hunting than do other servals. If disturbed, the mother will shift her kittens one by one to a more secure place. Kittens eventually start accompanying their mother to hunts. At around six months, they acquire their permanent canines and begin to hunt themselves; they leave their mother at about 12 months of age. They may reach sexual maturity from 12 to 25 months of age. Life expectancy is about 10 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.|$|E
