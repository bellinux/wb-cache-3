40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} forecast models using data provided by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to monitor and develop forecast models for air quality management. The models used in this research are the LDF (Fisher Linear Discriminant Function), QDF (Quadratic Discriminant Function), REGF (Regression Function), BPNN (Backprop Neural Network), and the RBFN (Radial Basis Function Network). The data used for model evaluations span a 12 -year period from 1990 to 2002. A control chart of the data is also examined for possible shifts in the distribution of ozone present in the Houston atmosphere during this time period. Results of this research reveal variables that are significantly related to the ozone problem in the Houston area. Models developed in this paper may assist air quality managers in modeling and forecasting <b>ozone</b> <b>formations</b> using meteorological variables. This is the first study that has extensively compared the efficiency of LDF, QDF, REGF, BPNN and RBFN forecast models used for tracking air quality. Prior studies have evaluated Neural Networks, ARIMA and regression models. ...|$|R

In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence.

25|$|The {{contribution}} of each gas to {{the greenhouse effect}} {{is determined by the}} characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to <b>ozone</b> <b>formation.</b> Shindell et al. (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates {{as a result of this}} effect.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the summer}} in 1970, when the {{photochemical}} smog took place in Japan, a number of persons concerned have been studying to explain this phenomenon. But {{it is still the}} most important problem that the cause of the heavy damage, such as dizziness, numb, spasm, was not solved by a formal smog theory. The authers thought that a new phenomenon would be caused by a new condition, which was probably caused by the high concentrated existence of aromatics in exhaust gas and in the environment. Then besides the study to discover enviromental toxicants, the photochemical reactions of aromatics were mainly examined. This paper contains the results until now, Some new results are as follows: most aromatics react as fast as olefines do, and concern the <b>ozone</b> <b>formations.</b> Xylenes and Toluene are important. These reactions are the cleavage of aromatic ring, the oxidation of side chain, the nitration and hydroxidation of benzene ring and the displacement of these functional groups. The remarkable compounds due to photochemical reaction were acrolein, acetone, methyl nitrate, nitrophenois, nitrocresols dinitrocresols, etc. It seems interesting that these nitroaromatics have the same physiologlcal effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> occurs when nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), react in {{the atmosphere in the}} presence of sunlight. NOx, CO, and VOCs are called ozone precursors. Motor vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and chemical solvents are the major anthropogenic sources of these chemicals. Another source is windshield washer fluid. Although these precursors often originate in urban areas, winds can carry NOx hundreds of kilometers, causing <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> to occur in less populated regions as well. Methane, a VOC whose atmospheric concentration has increased tremendously during the last century, contributes to <b>ozone</b> <b>formation</b> but on a global scale rather than in local or regional photochemical smog episodes. In situations where this exclusion of methane from the VOC group of substances is not obvious, the term Non-Methane VOC (NMVOC) is often used.|$|E

Ozone has been suggested to cause the greatest amount of damage to vegetation as compared to other gaseous pollutants.

We investigated the effects of elevated carbon dioxide and/or <b>ozone</b> on wood <b>formation</b> in young poplars. Trees were bent in order to induce tension wood formation on the upper side of the stem and opposite wood on the lower side. Under ozone, lignin and cellulose biosynthesis decreased probably due to lower availability in carbon skeletons. Cellulose was more affected than lignin resulting in a reduction of cellulose to lignin ratio in wood. Wood anatomy and density was also modified by ozone. Tension wood was generally more altered than opposite wood. All these results showed a strong impact of <b>ozone</b> on wood <b>formation</b> and wood quality and suggested a coordinated regulation of lignin and cellulose synthesis.

40|$|Fine scale {{layering}} of haze {{and composition}} in Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere was investigated using visible/UV images from Cassini's Imaging Science Sub-system (ISS) and IR spectra from Cassini's Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer (CIRS). Both ISS and CIRS independently show fine layered structures in haze and composition, respectively, in the 150 - 450 km altitude range with a preferred vertical wavelength of around 50 km. Layers are most pronounced around the north polar winter vortex, although some weaker layers do exist at more southerly latitudes. The amplitude of composition layers in each trace gas profile {{is proportional to}} the relative enrichment of that species in the winter polar vortex compared to equatorial latitudes. As enrichment is caused by polar subsidence, this suggests a dynamical origin. We propose that the polar layers are caused by cross-latitude advection across the vortex boundary.

As a reason why these theories cannot provide a full explanation of the process of regime formation, Young states that they are not based on real negotiation models.
