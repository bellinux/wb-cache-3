40|$|ISO data {{taken with}} the long-wavelength imaging photo-polarimeter ISOPHOT are {{presented}} of 18 pre-stellar cores at three far-infrared wavelengths - 90, 170 and 200 microns. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> are detected clearly at 170 and 200 but only one is detected strongly at 90 microns, indicating that mostly they are very cold, with typical temperatures of only 10 - 20 K. Colour temperature images are constructed for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> are seen to be either isothermal, or to have associated temperature gradients from <b>the</b> <b>core</b> centres to their edges, with all except one being cooler at the centre. We compare the data with previous ISOCAM absorption data and calculate the energy balance for those cores in common between the two samples. We find that the energy radiated by each <b>core</b> in <b>the</b> far-IR {{is similar to that}} absorbed at shorter wavelengths. Hence there is no evidence for a central heating source in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> - even those for which previous evidence for core contraction exists.

40|$|We present <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> C 18 O {{observations}} by the Nobeyama Millimeter Array toward dense clumps with radii of ~ 0. 3 pc in six cluster-forming regions including massive (proto) stars. We identified 171 cores, whose radius, line width, {{and molecular}} mass range from 0. 01 to 0. 09 pc, 0. 43 to 3. 33 km/s, and 0. 5 to 54. 1 Mo, respectively. Many cores with various line widths exist in one clump, and <b>the</b> index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line width-radius relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> and <b>the</b> parental clump differs from core to <b>core</b> in <b>the</b> clump. This indicates that <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> dissipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbulent motion varies for each core in one clump. Although <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> increases with <b>the</b> line width, most cores are gravitationally {{bound by the}} external pressure. In addition, the line width and <b>the</b> external pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> tend to decrease with the distance from <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clump, and these dependencies {{may be caused by}} the inner H 2 density structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clump that affects <b>the</b> physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> number density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> and <b>the</b> number density <b>of</b> young (proto) stars have a similar relationship to the average H 2 density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clumps.
