5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{he did to}} give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed {{to raise funds for}} local projects like Boys' and Girls' Clubs found him always ready to do whatever was needed.|$|E
5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, {{to the point that}} at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that Spector {{wanted to}} achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create}} a better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} armour. In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, which was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> for which he had been campaigning.|$|E

5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Dugas insisted upon {{was that the}} PC version {{would not be a}} port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended {{to be part of a}} technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

50|$|Although Greta's {{grandparents}} Katherine (Ellen Burstyn) and Joseph (Michael Murphy) are initially {{concerned about}} her boyfriend's criminal past, Julie proves himself worthy of their trust and demonstrates that he truly does care for Greta. Joseph tells him about Greta's father, who committed suicide in front of Greta when she was very young. Julie also demonstrates his respect for Greta when she attempts to lose her virginity to him. He tells her {{he will not be}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> she checks off of her 'To Do List' and {{that it has to be}} another time.|$|R
25|$|Cosplaying {{may also}} involve cross-dressing, for some females {{may wish to}} dress as a male, and vice versa (see Crossplay). Breast binding (for females) is not {{uncommon}} and is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> likely needed to cosplay a male character.|$|E

25|$|This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{that really}} make the race interesting.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{that cause}} the most {{confusion}} for people that {{are not familiar with}} the game are the Holding the Ball, Dropping the Ball, and Throwing rules.

25|$|The Tale was {{originally}} published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple.

This difference in printer is only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that led to debate over authorship of the work.|$|E
