5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004.

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{covering}} and domination problems <b>on</b> <b>directed</b> graphs. Although undirected Vertex Cover and Edge Dominating Set are well-studied classical graph problems, the directed versions {{have not been}} studied much {{due to the lack}} of clear definitions. We give natural definitions for Directed r-In (Out) Vertex Cover and Directed (p,q) -Edge Dominating Set as directed generations of Vertex Cover and Edge Dominating Set. For these problems, we show that (1) Directed r-In (Out) Vertex Cover and Directed (p,q) -Edge Dominating Set are NP-complete <b>on</b> planar <b>directed</b> acyclic graphs except when r= 1 or (p,q) =(0, 0), (2) if r>= 2, Directed r-In (Out) Vertex Cover is W[2]-hard and (c*ln k) -inapproximable <b>on</b> <b>directed</b> acyclic graphs, (3) if either p or q is greater than 1, Directed (p,q) -Edge Dominating Set is W[2]-hard and (c*ln k) -inapproximable <b>on</b> <b>directed</b> acyclic graphs, (4) all problems can be solved in polynomial time on trees, and (5) Directed (0, 1),(1, 0),(1, 1) -Edge Dominating Set are fixed-parameter tractable in general graphs.

5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.

5|$|In the Modern Age and Renaissance, European herbals diversified and innovated, {{and came}} to rely more <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> {{observation}} than being mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes by Leonhart Fuchs (1542, with over 400 plants), the astrologically themed Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper (1653), and the Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell (1737).|$|E
5|$|Moore's {{early work}} is focused <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> carving, {{in which the}} form of the {{sculpture}} evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into modernism paralleled that of Barbara Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory sketches and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; in old age, when he had arthritis, he continued to draw.|$|E

There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E

Control measures have been focused <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based <b>on</b> <b>direct</b> comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party.

When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
