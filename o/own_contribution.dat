5|$|Sessions for the {{proposed}} album took place at London's Abbey Road Studios, beginning on 2 February 1971. In addition to his <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> as guitarist, Harrison enlisted some of the musicians {{with whom he had}} recorded All Things Must Pass: Gary Wright, on keyboards; Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon; Voormann and Carl Radle (the latter another member of the Dominos), alternating on bass; and Badfinger's Pete Ham on second guitar and percussion. Another participant was Leon Russell, familiar to Phil Spector as a regular member of the Wrecking Crew during the mid 1960s. Recording continued at Abbey Road on 3 February, during which Lennon joined the proceedings, allegedly on piano.|$|E
5|$|There are forty six {{characters}} encountered {{through the}} story that can be recruited, each offering their <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> to the story. The majority of the main cast comes from the Greil Mercenaries group, led by its eponymous founder, Greil (voiced by Stephan Weyte). The protagonist is Ike (voiced by Jason Adkins), Greil's son. He is accompanied on his travels by Mist (voiced by Elsbeth Nathanson), his sister, and Elincia (voiced by Erica Evans), the lost heir to the Crimean Throne. Other Beorc characters include Titania, a former knight of Crimea, and Soren, a mage and tactician serving under Greil. The Laguz characters include Lethe, a cat Laguz with a strong hatred of Beorc; and Caineghis, the lion king of the beast Laguz who wishes for peaceful co-existence with the Beorc. The main antagonists are Daein generals called the Four Riders, which include the enigmatic Black Knight (voiced by Mark Dias), and their master King Ashnard, the ruler of Daein.|$|E
5|$|The late 9th {{and early}} 10th century {{constitute}} the earliest and most productive period of medieval Bulgarian literature. Having spent {{his early years}} in Constantinople, Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court, but eliminated its assimilative effect by means of military power and religious autonomy. The disciples of Cyril and Methodius, among whom Clement of Ohrid, Naum and Constantine of Preslav, continued their educational work in Bulgaria, actively translating Christian texts, such as the Bible and the works of John Chrysostom, Basil of Caesarea, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius of Alexandria, as well as historic chronicles such as these of John Malalas and George Hamartolus, to Bulgarian. The reign of Simeon also witnessed {{the production of a}} number of original theological and secular works, such as John Exarch's Six Days (Šestodnev), Constantine of Preslav's Alphabetical Prayer and Proclamation of the Holy Gospels, and Černorizec Hrabǎr's An Account of Letters. Simeon's <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries, for example in the Praise to Tsar Simeon preserved in the Zlatostruj collection and Simeon's Collection, to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum.|$|E

25|$|Foxe {{based his}} {{accounts}} of martyrs before {{the early modern}} period on previous writers, including Eusebius, Bede, Matthew Paris, and many others.

Here Foxe had primary sources of all kinds to draw on: episcopal registers, reports of trials, and the testimony of eyewitnesses, a remarkable range of sources for English historical writing of the period.|$|E

25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} Sparta's <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> was just 300 Spartiates (accompanied by their attendants and {{probably}} perioikoi auxiliaries), the total force assembled {{for the defense}} of the pass of Thermopylae came to something between four and seven thousand Greeks. They faced a Persian army who had invaded from the north of Greece under Xerxes I. Herodotus stated that this army consisted of over two million men; modern scholars consider this to be an exaggeration and give estimates ranging from 70,000 to 300,000.|$|E
25|$|Athar's highest ODI score (82) came against Pakistan in 1997. There, {{he put on}} {{a century}} {{partnership}} (110) with skipper Akram Khan (59).

This partnership set up Bangladesh's first ever ODI win. His best bowling in ODI was 2/33 against India at Mohali in 1997. Sourav Ganguly was one of his victims.|$|E

As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E

25|$|In July 1988, in {{his second}} year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main {{organiser}} of an independent student exhibition, Freeze, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's Docklands. He gained sponsorship from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst's <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint. After graduating, Hirst was included in New Contemporaries show and in a group show at Kettles Yard Gallery in Cambridge. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached Karsten Schubert, but was turned down.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh {{took part}} in the 1990 Austral-Asia Cup, the Asia Cup in 1990–91, 1995, and 1997, {{but it was not until}} 1998 that they won their first ODI. Their 22-match losing streak since their first ODI was at the time a record. Bangladesh posted its first ODI win against Kenya, in India thanks largely to Mohammad Rafique, who contributed a fiery 77 runs and took 3 wickets. Put on 137 for the first wicket with Athar Ali Khan. Athar's <b>own</b> <b>contribution</b> was 47. In October 1998, Bangladesh hosted (but did not {{participate}} in) the first ever ICC KnockOut Trophy (which later became the ICC Champions Trophy), a knock-out ODI tournament featuring all the Test playing nations.|$|E
25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} to make their <b>own</b> <b>contribution,</b> {{inspired}} by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which {{the dignity of the}} human person, shared responsibility, and love may be living realities. They should firmly commit themselves to oppose every form of exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances.|$|E
