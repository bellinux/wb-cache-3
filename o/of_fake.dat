40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study examined the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> in a self-administered occupational personality questionnaire on the World Wide Web and explored whether the degree <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> is related to Self-monitoring and login times. Using a between subjects design, employees were instructed to “answer honestly”, to “fake good”, or to answer as if applying for a job. Results revealed faking in the web-based personality questionnaire for two out of five dimensions (i. e., conscientiousness and self-motivation). Age was found to moderate the degree <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> with older people showing a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> Controlling for age and level of education, results revealed that high self-monitors demonstrated more faking compared to low self-monitors. Finally, slow responders showed higher degrees <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> compared to fast responders. We also discuss implications for online personnel selection and suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Applicants {{may be more}} {{motivated}} to fake than incumbents and may fake more on some items than others. The present study investigated both item and person characteristics as predictors <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> At the item level, both item transparency and job-relevance were hypothesized {{to be associated with}} higher levels <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> In contrast, item verifiability was hypothesized to be associated with lower levels <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> At the person level, applicants were expected to have a higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> than incumbents. Data was taken from an existing pool of applicants (n = 507) and incumbents (n = 302) at a customer calling center. The study was performed using a multilevel-logistic regression (MLR) approach to estimating person response curve (PRC) for results for Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness items. None of the item-level results were significant for Conscientiousness, but the analyses found significant item-level effects for Extraversion and Openness. First, item transparency was related to higher levels <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> Also, individuals were more likely to <b>fake</b> for items <b>of</b> low verifiability than items of high verifiability. Unexpectedly, individuals were more likely to <b>fake</b> for items <b>of</b> low job-relevance than items of high job-relevance. The results for person-level effects showed that applicants exhibited substantial model fit over incumbents, although incumbents appeared to have higher levels <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> than incumbents. The results and implications are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{deliberate}} planting <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> {{documents to}} be found by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British {{and others in the}} First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided {{it was a good}} omen. He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E
5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself {{at the end and}} to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers.|$|E

5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} the onslaught <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> {{news and the}} beginnings of the alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools to triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the invasion, the Allies {{conducted}} Operation Bodyguard, the overall strategy designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio-traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, and Fortitude South, a major deception designed to fool the Germans into believing that the landings would take place at Pas de Calais in July. A fictitious First U.S. Army Group was invented, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton. The Allies constructed dummy tanks, trucks, and landing craft, and positioned them near the coast. Several military units, including II Canadian Corps and 2nd Canadian Division, moved into the area to bolster the illusion that a large force was gathering there. As well as the broadcast <b>of</b> <b>fake</b> radio-traffic, genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there. Patton remained stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais. Military and civilian personnel alike were aware of the need for secrecy, and the invasion troops were as much as possible kept isolated, especially in the period immediately before the invasion. One American general was sent back to the United States in disgrace after revealing the invasion date at a party.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1982. Bibliography: leaves 129 - 153. Microfiche. vii, 153 leaves, bound 29 cmThe {{present study}} was a test of several {{hypotheses}} derived from a theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> behavior and faking detection techniques in neuropsychological assessment. The model proposes that patterns <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> on neuropsychological test batteries can be analyzed in terms of relationships among (a) the sophistication of the subject; (b) the events to which the subject attributes his or her apparent dysfunctions. (c) the symptoms and problems which the subject intends to fake; (d) strategies used in attempting to fake believable deficits without getting caught; and (e) the perceived risks and potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>faking.</b> The model predicts that subjects tend to selectively fake only tests which are perceived as being relevant to the intended symptoms, implying {{that the results of}} tests used to detect faking (such as the MMPI) may not correlate with patterns <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> on other tests in the battery. An alternative approach would be to develop measures <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> which are intrinsic to the tests of interest, based upon principles <b>of</b> <b>faking</b> detection. The present experiment tested the selective faking hypothesis and several intrinsic faking detection measures. Sixty-nine neurologically normal undergraduates were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three conditions: (1) Honest Normal control: (2) Specific Faking (instructions to fake specific sensory-motor deficits secondary to head trauma: or (3) Global Faking (instructions to <b>fake</b> unspecified symptoms <b>of</b> traumatic brain injury.) A battery of neuropsychological and extrinsic faking detection tests was administered to all subjects; detailed questionnaires and interviews were also administered to the faking groups. The results generally support the faking selectivity hypothesis, confirm limitations in the use <b>of</b> extrinsic <b>faking</b> detectors, and provide initial data on a set of intrinsic measures...|$|R
