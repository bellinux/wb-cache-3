What {{was left of the}} organization’s leading members and officers were Weathermen. However, as “excised as it might have been,” PL did meet <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>last</b> day in the Coliseum. “Proclaiming itself the true SDS,” PL met {{on the other side of}} the convention center, away from the new SDS, who spent their last day planning a Chicago event that would take place that October, only a few months later. This event is what would later be named the Days of Rage.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>last</b> album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E

2500|$|In June 1993, during England's first innings at Old Trafford, Gatting {{received}} Shane Warne's first delivery – {{now known}} as the [...] "Ball of the Century" [...] – in an Ashes match. Warne pitched the ball a foot outside leg stump and spun the ball past Gatting's bat to clip the off bail. Gatting's dismissal in the second innings was also unusual, in that he was bowled off the very last ball of the fourth day's play by Merv Hughes, meaning he was unable to help England bat out the last day.
