5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters {{end up with}} large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E

While Virgil's {{writings of}}ten do not distinguish between a wine's name and the grape variety, he made frequent mention of the Aminean grape variety, which Pliny and Columella ranked as the best in the empire. Pliny described five sub-varieties of the grape that produced similar but distinct wines, declaring it to be native to the Italian peninsula. While he claimed that only Democritus knew of every grape variety that existed, he endeavored to speak with authority on the grapes he believed were the only ones worthy of consideration.|$|E

To thrive and be active in fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus as well as access to various vitamins and minerals.

Newly formulated time-release nutrients, specifically manufactured for wine fermentations, <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> advantageous conditions for yeast.

[...] Such a view is backed up by other observers of Russian political life. Clifford J. Levy of The New York Times wrote in April 2008: [...] "Just as the government has tightened control over political life, so, too, has it intruded in matters of faith. The Kremlin's surrogates in many areas have turned the Russian Orthodox Church into a de facto official religion, warding off other Christian denominations that seem to <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant competition for worshipers. [...] This close alliance {{between the government and the}} Russian Orthodox Church has become a defining characteristic of Mr. Putin's tenure, a mutually reinforcing choreography that is usually described here as working 'in symphony'." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} neither wars nor {{population}} movements had little effect. In the Irrawaddy valley, for example, north-to-south migrations [...] "pitted newcomers against established populations and encouraged stereotyping both as an emotional response to an alien presence and as a (perhaps unconscious) strategy of group mobilization. Shan raids on Upper Burma, which bred bitter anti-Shan diatribes, <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> dramatic example." [...] But the weak link between ethnicity and political loyalty meant patron-client relationships remained the single most important factor in state building. One figure who successfully exploited this at the grandest scale was Bayinnaung. The emperor formed patron-client relationships based on universal Buddhist cultural concepts—alongside the threat of massive military reprisals—to hold the empire. He presented himself as cakkavatti, or World Ruler, par excellence, and formed personal relationships based on the concepts of thissa (allegiance) and kyezu (obligation). The tradition of cross-ethnic patron-client relationships continued to thrive, albeit at smaller scales, in mainland Southeast Asia down to the 19th century.|$|E
