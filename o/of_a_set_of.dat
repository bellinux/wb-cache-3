40|$|Two algebroid {{branches}} {{are said}} to be equivalent if they have the same multiplicity sequence. It is known that two algebroid branches R and T are equivalent if and only if their Arf closures, R' and T' have the same value semigroup, which is an Arf numerical semigroup and can be expressed in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>set</b> <b>of</b> information, <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> characters of the branch. We extend the above equivalence to algebroid curves with d> 1 branches. An equivalence class is described, in this more general context, by an Arf semigroup, that is not a numerical semigroup, but is <b>a</b> subsemigroup <b>of</b> N^d. We express this semigroup in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>set</b> <b>of</b> information, <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> characters of the curve, and apply this result to determine other curves equivalent to a given one.

5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997.

In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore {{be used as a}} prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E
