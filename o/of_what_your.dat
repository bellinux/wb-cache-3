[...] "The {{participants}} will be bound by norms of good manners: through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through circumspection in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due." [...] Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social framings is critical, just as is {{an awareness of the}} audience. Depending on who you’re speaking with (a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc.) you will curve your speech to fit the frame <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> intended audience is expecting.|$|E
500|$|Usher held {{multiple}} private listening {{sessions for}} Looking 4 Myself. On April 27, 2012 he debuted the album in the off-broadway show Fuerza Bruta: Look Up, in Daryl Roth Theater in New York City. When speaking to MTV, he explained his reasoning for performing {{in the show}} [...] "It's not often that you're able to give somewhat of a visual or an emotional kind of basis <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> songs mean [...] I felt like, yeah, {{it would be a}} physical challenge, yeah {{it would be a lot}} for me, but [...] at least try it, there are many times I'd seen the show and I'd only hoped that I would make it happen". Steven Horowitz of Rolling Stone commented that Usher [...] "theatrically sequenced the entirety of the project to strobing lights and choreographed moves". Horowitz also praised the singer's performance, concluding that [...] "the veteran entertainer reasserts himself as a master of rapturous dance fodder, capable of turning a room into a thumping rave with ease". Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live—hosted by Will Ferrell—where he performed the singles [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Climax". He performed both singles again, in the 2012 Today summer concert, being the opening act of the series. Usher performed [...] "Scream" [...] in the 2012 Billboard Music Awards; during the performance he wore a black suit, bowler hat and bow tie while dancing with a masked female, who later disappeared behind a cape and was replaced by a male dancer who mirrored Usher's dance routines.|$|E
500|$|With Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt [...] "freer to experiment" [...] {{with the}} next album, 1998's Prolonging the Magic; he wrote and {{produced}} every song. As {{a result of this}} experimentation, the album was noted as [...] "loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and musical saw thrown in for extra flavour". McCrea stated that he deliberately [...] "approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe". Music Week described it as an [...] "inspired collection of leftfield rock", while Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News said that it [...] "brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor,' puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> fingers do {{while the rest of the}} body snoozes". Other reviewers were less complimentary, with Mike Pattenden in The Times writing that [...] "Prolonging the Magic suggests that [...] may well be destined to go down as one-hit wonders...While a handful stand out – the country waltz Mexico, You Turn the Screws and Hem of Your Garment – Prolonging the Magic shows McRea and company to be little more than an above average bar-room act. Cake are surviving on songwriting crumbs". The album peaked at number33 on the Billboard 200, was listed in The Columbian as the second best album of 1998, and eventually went platinum after shipping over 1million units.|$|E
