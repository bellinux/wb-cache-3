50|$|There {{are several}} downsides to this approach. The most obvious is that seeds that land <b>outside</b> the <b>furrows</b> {{will not have}} the growth shown by the plants sown in the furrow, since they are too shallow on the soil. Because of this, they are lost to the elements. Many of the seeds remain on the surface where they are {{vulnerable}} to being eaten by birds or carried away on the wind. Surface seeds commonly never germinate at all or germinate prematurely, only to be killed by frost.|$|R
50|$|In older {{methods of}} planting, a field is {{initially}} prepared with a plough {{to a series}} of linear cuts known as furrows. The field is then seeded by throwing the seeds over the field, a method known as manual broadcasting. The seeds may not be sown to the right depth nor the proper distance from one another. Seeds that land in the furrows have better protection from the elements, and natural erosion or manual raking will cover them while leaving some exposed. The result is a field planted roughly in rows, but having a large number of plants <b>outside</b> the <b>furrow</b> lanes.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of soil compaction and root-restricting layers (e. g., plow pans) resulting from long-term agricultural practices often poses difficulties when converting these sites into loblolly pine plantations.

40|$|SummaryMicrotubules of the {{mitotic spindle}} are {{believed}} to provide positional cues for the assembly of the actin-based contractile ring {{and the formation of}} the subsequent cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, astral microtubules have been thought to inhibit cortical contraction <b>outside</b> the cleavage <b>furrow.</b> Here, we demonstrate by live imaging and RNA interference (RNAi) that astral microtubules play two distinct roles in initiating cleavage furrow formation. In early anaphase, microtubules are required for contractile ring assembly; in late anaphase, microtubules show different cortical behavior and seem to suppress cortical contraction at the poles, as suggested in previous studies. These two distinct phases of microtubule behavior depend on distinct regulatory pathways, one involving the γ-tubulin complex and the other requiring aurora-A kinase. We propose that temporal and spatial regulation of two distinct phases of astral microtubule behavior is crucial in specifying the position and timing of furrowing...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Heavy meromyosin (HMM) {{decoration}} of actin filaments {{was used to}} detect the polarity of microfilaments in interphase and cleaving rat kangaroo (PtK 2) cells. Ethanol at- 20 °C was {{used to make the}} cells permeable to HMM followed by tannic acid-glutaraldehyde fixation for electron microscopy. Uniform polarity of actin filaments was observed at cell junctions and central attachment plaques with the HMM arrowheads always pointing away from the junction or plaque. Stress fibers were banded in appearance with their component microfilaments exhibiting both parallel and antiparallel orientation with respect to one another. Identical banding of microfilament bundles was also seen in cleavage furrows with the same variation in filament polarity as found in stress fibers. Similarly banded fibers were not seen <b>outside</b> the cleavage <b>furrow</b> in mitotic cells. By the time that a mid-body was present, the actin filaments in the cleavage furrow were no longer in banded fibers. The alternating dark and light bands of both the stress fibers and cleavage furrow fibers are approximately equal in length, each measuring ^- 0. 16 p. m. Actin filaments were present in both bands, and individual decorated filaments could sometimes be traced through four band lengths.

To analyze the assembly mechanism of the contractile ring, we microinjected a small amount of rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (rh-pha) or rhodamine-labeled actin (rhactin) into dividing normal rat kidney cells, rh-pha was microinjected during prometaphase or metaphase to label actin filaments that were present at that stage. As mitosis proceeded into anaphase, the labeled iliamerits became associated with the cortex of the cell. During cytokinesis, rh-pha was depleted from polar regions and became highly concentrated into the equatorial region. The distribution of total actin illaments, as revealed by staining the whole cell with fluorescein phaUoidin, showed a much less pronounced difference between the polar and the equatorial regions. The sites of de novo assembly of actin filaments during {{the formation of the}} contractile ring were determined by microinjecting rh-actin shortly before cytokinesis, and then extracting and fixing the cell during mid-cytokinesis. Injected rhodamine actin was only slightly concentrated in the contractile ring, as compared to the distribution of total actin filaments.

However, its mechanism still remains unclear. Studies over the past twenty years have indicated that actin and myosin II are likely to be involved in this process. For example, actin filaments show a parallel, bundle-like arrangement in the cleavage furrow, forming a "contractile ring " (Perry et al., 1971...|$|R
5000|$|The Murus Romuli as {{remembered by}} ancient historians is {{described}} by Rodolfo Lanciani:"The text most frequently quoted {{in reference to the}} Murus Romuli is that of Tacitus, according to which the furrow ploughed by the hero — the sulcus primigenius — started from a point in the Forum Boarium, marked in later times by the bronze Bull of Myron; and followed the valley between the Palatine and the Aventine as far as the altar of Consus, the valley between the Palatine and the Cælian as far as the Curiæ Veteres, the east slope of the hill as far as the Sacellum Larum. The same historian says that the Ara Maxima of Hercules was included within the furrow, and Dionysius states that Vesta's temple was <b>outside</b> it. The <b>furrow</b> followed the foot of the cliffs or slopes of the Palatine, its course being marked with stone cippi. Others affirm that the city of Romulus was square (τετράγωνος — Roma Quadrata). The truth is that neither the walls nor the pomerium of Romulus can be said to make a square; that a line drawn from beyond the Ara Maxima to the Ara Consi cannot be said to go [...] "along the foot of the cliffs of the Palatine" [...] (per ima montis Palatini); that the valley in those days was covered with water, deep enough to be navigated by canoes, so that neither a furrow could be ploughed through it, nor stone cippi set up to mark the line of the furrow. Moreover, the same marshes extended on the southeast side as far as the Curiæ Veteres, on the northwest as far as the Temple of Vesta; and the shape of the Palatine walls was rather trapezoid, like that of a terramara of the valley of the Po, than square like an Etruscan templum; while, lastly, the name of Roma Quadrata did not belong to the city on the hill, but to the altar described in Pagan and Christian Rome, p. 70, which {{stood in front of the}} Temple of Apollo." ...|$|R
