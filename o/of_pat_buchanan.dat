50|$|In 1999, Trump {{switched}} to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement <b>of</b> David Duke, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> and Lenora Fulani.|$|R
2500|$|Perot's {{candidacy}} received increasing {{media attention}} when the competitive {{phase of the}} primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies <b>of</b> Republican <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, Perot was the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians.

25|$|In the 2000 presidential election, Perot {{refused to}} become openly {{involved}} with the internal Reform Party dispute between supporters <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and John Hagelin. Perot was reportedly unhappy with {{what he saw as}} the disintegration of the party, as well as his own portrayal in the press; thus, he chose to remain quiet. He appeared on Larry King Live four days before the election and endorsed George W. Bush for president. Despite his earlier opposition to NAFTA, Perot remained largely silent about expanded use of guest-worker visas in the United States, with Buchanan supporters attributing this silence to his corporate reliance on foreign workers. Some state parties affiliated with the new (Buchananite) America First Party.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard {{supported}} {{the presidential campaign}} <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> in 1992, and wrote that [...] "with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy." [...] When Buchanan {{dropped out of the}} Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, [...] who Rothbard wrote had [...] "brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race." [...] Rothbard ultimately supported George Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election.|$|E
500|$|Keyes {{was also}} {{especially}} critical <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> once saying {{during an interview}} on the Talk from the Heart program with Al Kresta (simulcast on KJSL St. Louis and WMUZ Detroit) that Buchanan had a [...] "black heart." [...] Keyes's entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan had been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and [...] "cultural war" [...] {{to the center of}} the public policy debate. [...] Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained by Atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited. [...] He was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20 minutes later by Atlanta's mayor at the time, Bill Campbell.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the presidential}} election, Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas {{defeated}} Republican incumbent President George H. W. Bush and Texas businessman Ross Perot. Clinton easily won {{the electoral college}} with 370 electoral votes, but took just 43 {{percent of the popular}} vote, the fourth-lowest share of any victorious presidential candidate. Perot's independent candidacy won the largest share of the popular vote of any third party or independent candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 candidacy. Clinton defeated former California Governor Jerry Brown and former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas to take the Democratic nomination. Bush defeated a primary challenge from commentator, and former [...] Reagan White House Director <b>of</b> Communications <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> to earn re-nomination as the Republican candidate.|$|R
5000|$|Prince {{credits his}} time as a White House intern {{with some of his}} {{political}} views. He said that [...] "having that White House internship responsibility and badges, I walked around some of these other cavernous federal agencies, and {{you want to talk about}} depressing? Walk through HHS or HUD or Commerce, you name it. Leviathan realized." [...] Speaking of his internship, Prince said, [...] "I saw a lot of things I didn't agree with--homosexual groups being invited in, the budget agreement, the Clean Air Act." [...] Disenchanted, Prince became a backer <b>of</b> presidential candidate <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b>|$|R

50|$|During the 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential elections, Raimondo {{supported}} the campaigns <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> {{both as a}} Republican and in the Reform Party. As he is openly gay, his support of the social conservative Buchanan attracted considerable attention.|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 presidential {{campaign}} <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> conservative pundit and adviser to both President Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, began on March 2, 1999 in New Hampshire. Buchanan had twice sought {{the nomination of}} the Republican Party (in 1992 and 1996).|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, {{he campaigned}} {{nationwide}} {{for the nomination}} of the Reform Party of the United States of America for President of the United States. [...] In some Reform Party straw polls, he polled better than the ultimate winner <b>of</b> the nomination <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> though still 40 points behind the frontrunner John Hagelin. [...] In the California 2000 presidential primaries, he came in third among five Reform Party candidates, after Donald Trump and John B. Anderson, with 15% of the vote. Including [...] "votes cast by Independents or voters of another party", he came in third among six Reform Party candidates with 14% of the vote, after Trump and George D. Weber.|$|R
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of the incumbent president, Bill Clinton, had improved greatly from 1994 to 1996 thanks to a booming economy as well as winning public opinion in the 1995 budget shutdown, so Clinton and vice president Al Gore faced no serious opposition in the Democratic primaries. A few months before his passing in April 1994, Richard Nixon warned Dole [...] "If the economy's good, you're not going to beat Clinton." [...] Dole was the early front runner for the GOP nomination in the 1996 presidential race. At least eight candidates ran for the nomination. Dole was expected {{to win the nomination}} against underdog candidates such as the more conservative Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and more moderate Senator Arlen Specter <b>of</b> Pennsylvania. <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> upset Dole in the early New Hampshire primary, however, with Dole finishing second and former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander finishing third. Speechwriter Kerry Tymchuk remarked [...] "Dole was on the ropes because he wasn't conservative enough".|$|R
5000|$|Reviews were broadly {{positive}} {{not only}} domestically (in India) but also internationally. The film was discussed or reviewed in Newsweek, Time, the Washington Post, The Public Historian, Cross Currents, The Journal of Asian Studies, Film Quarterly, The Progressive, The Christian Century and elsewhere. Ben Kingsley's performance was especially praised. Among {{the few who}} took a more negative view of the film, historian Lawrence James called it [...] "pure hagiography" [...] while anthropologist Akhil Gupta said it [...] "suffers from tepid direction and a superficial and misleading interpretation of history." [...] The film was also criticised by some right-wing commentators who objected to the film's advocacy <b>of</b> nonviolence, including <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Emmett Tyrrell, and especially Richard Grenier.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 a new America First Party {{organization}} {{was formed by}} a group <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> supporters who left the Reform Party.

50|$|The {{political}} positions <b>of</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> (born 1938), an American politician, {{columnist and}} news analyst, can generally {{be described as}} paleoconservative, {{and many of his}} views, particularly his opposition to American imperialism and the managerial state, echo those of the Old Right Republicans {{of the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Novak {{appeared}} on CNN on its opening week in 1980. His {{status as a}} well-known print reporter brought a sense of credibility to the fledgling new network, and Novak soon created a weekly interview show that Evans co-hosted. Novak became a regular panel member of The McLaughlin Group in 1982, starring alongside McLaughlin as well as Novak's personal friends Al Hunt and Mark Shields. Novak sparred frequently with McLaughlin {{despite the fact that}} they both held similar political views. He established a public image as a combative debater on the program. Novak then became the executive producer of Capital Gang, which also featured him as a key member of the show. He also took over as host <b>of</b> Crossfire from <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{incumbent}} president seeking re-election usually faces no significant opposition during their respective party's primaries, {{especially if they}} are still popular. For Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, for example, their respective paths to nomination became uneventful and the races become merely pro forma; all four then went on to win a second presidential term. Serious challenges are rare, but then generally presage failure to win the general election in the fall. During the 1976 Republican Party primaries, then-former California Governor Reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent President Gerald Ford; Ford then went on to lose the presidential election to Jimmy Carter, albeit carrying more states. Senator Ted Kennedy then carried 12 states while running against Carter during the 1980 Democratic Party primaries; Reagan then defeated Carter in the fall <b>of</b> 1980. <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> captured a decent percentage of a protest vote against George H. W. Bush during the 1992 Republican primaries, but only received a handful of delegates; Bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to Clinton.|$|R
5000|$|After Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, {{which led}} to the {{immediate}} departures of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Saturday Night Massacre" [...] of October 20, 1973, however, momentum towards impeachment grew rapidly. (In the view <b>of</b> Nixon speechwriter <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> who had been privy to Nixon's thinking, the president had known this would be the likely outcome of dismissing Cox.) On October 23, 1973, a landslide of resolutions calling for impeachment, impeachment investigations, and appointment of a special prosecutor were introduced against Nixon. The introduction of these resolutions continued for several days, but the Judiciary Committee was reluctant to start a formal investigation, especially with the Vice Presidency vacant after the resignation amid scandal of Spiro Agnew on October 10, 1973.|$|R
50|$|Terence P. Jeffrey became {{editor-in-chief}} in September 2007. Jeffrey was {{and remains}} an editor-at-large for the conservative weekly newspaper Human Events.
