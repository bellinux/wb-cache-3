5|$|The IDF's City of Training Bases, under {{construction}} near Beersheba, hopes to bring thousands <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> (mostly officers, senior NCOs and other staff) {{to live in}} the Negev, including Arad. According to Orli Yehezkel, CEO of the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee, said NIS 4.5 million will be invested in Arad, including a subsidy of NIS 1,000 per family per month for two years for families <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> wishing to move to Arad.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Roman generals, and the rewarding <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> with plunder {{on these}} campaigns, {{led to a}} general trend <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> becoming increasingly loyal to their generals {{rather than to the}} state. Rome was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because vast tracts of land had been given over to slave farming in which the slaves greatly outnumbered their Roman masters. In the 1st century BC at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern continued until 27 BC, when Octavian (later Augustus) successfully challenged the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (first citizen).|$|E

5|$|A Saxon–Prussian {{alliance}} {{fought the}} War of the Bavarian Succession (July 1778 – 21 May 1779) against the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy {{to prevent the}} Habsburgs from acquiring the Electorate of Bavaria. Although the war consisted {{of only a few}} minor skirmishes, thousands <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> died from disease and starvation, earning the conflict the name Kartoffelkrieg (Potato War) in Prussia and Saxony; in Habsburg Austria, it was sometimes called the Zwetschgenrummel (Plum Fuss).|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{who died in}} the war were never found, and {{similarly}} bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E

5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although {{it is possible that the}} 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent <b>of</b> <b>soldiers,</b> and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands <b>of</b> <b>soldiers</b> succumbed to disease and exhaustion and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E

Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E
