5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the parliament; some other institutions, such as the Croatian National Bank and the State Audit Office, also report directly to the parliament. The parliament appoints an <b>ombudsman</b> to promote and protect human rights and liberties established by the constitution, parliamentary legislation and treaties adopted by Croatia. The <b>ombudsman</b> is appointed for an eight-year term; the ombudsman's work is independent. The <b>ombudsman,</b> {{as well as all}} other persons authorised to act on behalf of the parliament, is granted parliamentary immunity equal to that enjoyed by parliamentary members.|$|E

50|$|Even though from a {{constitutional}} {{point of view}} monitoring the application of law by public authorities is the prerogative of the Riksdag, for reasons of principle it has been considered unacceptable to incorporate any political considerations into this supervision. For this reason the independent attitude adopted by the Parliamentary <b>Ombudsmen</b> has applied to {{their relationship with the}} Riksdag as well. For instance the Riksdag is not considered able to issue directives to the <b>Ombudsmen</b> about any individual case, nor can it express opinions retrospectively about how a case was dealt with or the final adjudication. Instead the authority of the Riksdag over the activities of the <b>Ombudsmen</b> finds expression in the instructions issued to the Parliamentary <b>Ombudsmen</b> and in the funds allocated to the Office. It is the Riksdag that decides on the budget for the Parliamentary <b>Ombudsmen</b> - not the government or the Ministry of Finance.|$|R
5|$|In 2009 the European <b>ombudsman</b> {{published}} {{statistics of}} citizens' complaints against EU institutions, {{with most of}} them filed against the Commission (66%) and concerning lack of transparency (36%). In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted {{in a number of}} reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences.

5000|$|The {{decision}} in 1975 {{to abolish the}} special right to waive prosecution {{was linked to the}} simultaneous reform of official accountability, which involved among other things major curtailment of the legal responsibility of public officials for their actions. In this context it was considered that there was no longer any need for the Parliamentary <b>Ombudsmen</b> {{to have the right to}} waive prosecution. Instead it was stipulated that in inquiries into cases the <b>Ombudsmen</b> were to be subject to the regulations that already applied to public prosecutors with regard to prosecution and the right to waive prosecution. Today, the 1986 instructions - the Act with Instructions for the Parliamentary <b>Ombudsmen</b> (1986:765) and the amendments added in 1989 - state that when undertaking the role of prosecutor the <b>Ombudsmen</b> are also to comply with the other statutory regulations applying to public prosecutors. (In addition the 1975 instructions also included a special regulation empowering the <b>Ombudsmen</b> to make critical or advisory comments and these have been transferred to the instructions that now apply.) ...|$|R

5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an <b>Ombudsman,</b> a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E

5|$|The {{first person}} to officially occupy the {{position}} was Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León in 1509. At the time, the Spanish monarchy was responsible for appointing the functionary who would perform this office. The first native Puerto Rican to perform the function was Juan Ponce de León II, as interim governor in 1579. During this administration, all of those appointed to take the position had served another function within the empire's government or the Roman Catholic Church. In 1898, the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the Spanish government ceded control of the island to the United States. During the first two years, the entire government in Puerto Rico was appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, the American government approved {{the establishment of the}} Foraker Act as a federal law, this act established a civilian government in the island. In 1947, the federal Elective Governor Act was enacted, which created a new system where, since 1948, the governor is elected through a democratic process every four years. The governor is in charge of Puerto Rico's executive branch and is responsible for appointing executive branch agency heads, including the Secretary of State, who fulfills the role of lieutenant governor, the legislative branch's <b>Ombudsman</b> and Comptroller and all judges in the judicial branch.|$|E
