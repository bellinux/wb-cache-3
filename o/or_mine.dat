5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an electrically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of this transformation, the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing guns in the 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats <b>or</b> <b>mine</b> sweepers attempting {{to break through the}} defences. The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} {{served with the}} High Seas Fleet after {{entering}} service, with {{only one in the}} fleet at a time, usually trading service with the fleet either for refits <b>or</b> <b>mine</b> warfare training. After the start of World War I, the ships laid several minefields, both to protect the German coast and also to interfere with British naval operations. In 1915, Albatross was transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet, where she was eventually ambushed by Russian cruisers and forced to beach in the Battle of Åland Islands in July. Nautilus took part in Operation Albion in 1917 and was rearmed in 1918 to support amphibious operations, but she did not see action in that role.|$|E

The number of flyable ships was greatly increased, and a new political backstory was introduced enabling the player to gain ranks in competing interstellar empires. Frontier Elite II appeared on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and IBM PC whilst Frontier: First Encounters was only released for IBM PC.|$|E
25|$|Mine collapses (<b>or</b> <b>mine</b> subsidences) {{have the}} {{potential}} to produce major effects above ground, which are especially devastating in developed areas. German underground coal-mining (especially in North Rhine-Westphalia) has damaged thousands of houses, and the coal-mining industries have set aside large sums in funding for future subsidence damages as part of their insurance and state-subsidy schemes. In a particularly spectacular case in the German Saar region (another historical coal-mining area), a suspected mine collapse in 2008 created an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, causing some damage to houses. Previously, smaller earthquakes had become increasingly common and coal mining was temporarily suspended in the area.|$|E

The brigade suffered 219 casualties at Gettysburg46 killed, 106 wounded, and 67 captureda loss of 16.6% of its strength.

500|$|Pluton was {{designed}} to carry 220 [...] Sautter-Harlé mines, but had space for 30 extra, {{for a total of}} 250. They were carried on the first deck, <b>or</b> <b>mine</b> deck, using a system of four rails along the sides of the ship and moved via chain-drives. Each pair of rails converged on a turntable at the forward end of the rails and a transverse spur connected the two turntables. The spur facilitated loading mines {{from one side of the}} ship and allowed mines to be moved to each of the rails. The rails ended in four ramps at the stern of the ship that sloped down at a 30° angle to minimize the shock of impact when the mines were released from the chain drive. Up to 270 of the smaller Bréguet B4 mines could be carried.|$|E

2500|$|Bazooka is {{the common}} name for a man-portable, tube launched, {{recoilless}} rocket antitank weapon, widely fielded by the United States Army. [...] Also {{referred to as the}} [...] "Stovepipe", the innovative bazooka was amongst the first generation of rocket propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid rocket motor for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade <b>or</b> <b>mine.</b> [...] The Bazooka also fired a HESH, effective against buildings and tank armour.
