5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received {{the ball in the}} Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side.</b> Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back {{more than two decades}} and originated from song.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

5|$|The {{palatial}} {{structures of}} mainland Greece share {{a number of}} common features. The {{focal point of the}} socio-political aspect of a Mycenaean palace was the megaron, the throne room. It was laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns. The throne was generally found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> upon entering the room, while the interior of the megaron was lavishly decorated, flaunting images designed intentionally to demonstrate the political and religious power of the ruler. Access to the megaron was provided through a court, which was reached from a propylon. The iconography of the palatial chambers is remarkably uniform throughout Greece. For instance, in Pylos and Tiryns the paintings are focused on marine motifs, providing depictions of octopi, fish and dolphins. Around the megaron a group of courtyards each opened upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters. In general Mycenaean palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side.</b> Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to the ceiling of the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E

Five minutes later, Barcelona launched a counter-attack starting with goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen and ending with Neymar volleying {{the ball into the}} goal, but it was ruled out for offside. Soon after, Iago Herrerín saved from Messi. In the 20th minute, Messi scored the first goal of the game, taking possession <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> of the pitch and beating four defenders before finishing with a near-post shot.

In the 36th minute, Neymar scored the second goal of the game, finishing from close range when set up by Suárez, after earlier work by Messi and Rakitić. Near {{the end of the first}} half, Andoni Iraola set up Iñaki Williams, whose volley missed the target.
