5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

25|$|Burdened {{again with}} theater and arts reporting, Bly left the Pittsburgh Dispatch in 1887 for New York City.

40|$|The issue <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> and use <b>of</b> {{force has}} become {{increasingly}} prevalent in both mainstream media and sociological research. However, while instances <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> against male citizens continue to make international headlines, female victims <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> fail to receive attention in both the media and scholarly research. This paper aims {{to answer the question}} of whether or not female victimization is being ignored by narratives of police misconduct. Using sociological, feminist, structural, organizational, and cultural approaches, the factors that establish the conditions for female victimization by police will be examined in detail. A variety of studies that highlight the existence <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> against women will also be presented and analyzed, which will then be combined with theoretical perspectives to explain the absence of women in this area of research...|$|R

25|$|On the whole, {{incidents}} <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> in Germany {{appear to}} be caused by racism and xenophobic attitudes towards foreign nationals, and occurs predominantly during arrests and in custody. Whilst Germany may be sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, this hasn't appeared to stop international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities. Every year, around 2,000 complaints <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> are reported, with the figure most likely being a less than accurate representation given that not every incident is reported. As high profile cases like the Cologne New Years Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances <b>of</b> police <b>brutality.</b> Whilst this incident occurred in 2014, high profile cases <b>of</b> police <b>brutality</b> have been reported to occur {{as far back as the}} 1990s.|$|R

25|$|In {{a minimum}} of 12 of the murders, Bonin was {{assisted}} {{by one or more}} of his four known accomplices. According to one attorney present throughout Bonin's subsequent confession, the escalating levels <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> he had exhibited towards his victims had been similar to that of a drug addict requiring an ever-greater increase of dosage to attain a satisfactory level of euphoria, and Bonin later emphasized to neurologists he had felt an intense sense of excitement as he searched for his victims.|$|E

25|$|The {{police in}} Dubai {{has long been}} accused <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> {{including}} the practice of torture leading to serious injury as well as death. In 2011 British tourist Lee Bradley Brown was arrested by the Dubai police and died in prison after succumbing to injuries inflicted by beatings allegedly from the Dubai police. Police have arrested many people in recent years for posting humorous or satirical videos on the internet. Anyone posting material deemed offensive to Islam, the government or to the royal families, are subject to arrest. Police have also been accused of using excessive force when dealing with protestors or prisoners.|$|E

Sheikh Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him. Amnesty International has also reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation. Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January 1972, a {{week before}} Bloody Sunday, an anti-{{internment}} march was held at Magilligan strand, near Derry. The protesters marched to a new internment camp there, but were stopped by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment. When some protesters threw stones and tried {{to go around the}} barbed wire, paratroopers drove them back by firing rubber bullets at close range and making baton charges. The paratroopers badly beat a number of protesters and had to be physically restrained by their own officers. These allegations <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> by paratroopers were reported widely on television and in the press. Some in the Army also thought there had been undue violence by the paratroopers.|$|E
25|$|According to Norris, {{the level}} <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> Bittaker had {{exhibited}} towards their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van: their final victim, Shirley Ledford, had actually pleaded {{to be killed}} in order that her agony could cease. Additional details provided by Norris provided further corroborating evidence to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Lucinda Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted, and that Schaefer had lost one shoe {{as she had been}} dragged into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979.|$|E
25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because {{there is no way to}} quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion <b>of</b> <b>brutality</b> among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
