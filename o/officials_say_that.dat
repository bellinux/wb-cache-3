5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E

He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate whether}} {{masturbation}} should be promoted in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany masturbation, {{are common in}} American correctional facilities. Connecticut Department of Corrections <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these restrictions are intended to avoid a hostile work environment for correctional officers. Other researchers argue allowing masturbation could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in prison rape or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks.|$|E

25|$|According to the New York Times, Paulson {{spoke with}} the CEO of Goldman Sachs two dozen times {{during the week of}} the bailout, though he {{obtained}} an ethics waiver before doing so.

25|$|Rifkin sued, {{arguing that}} his solitary {{imprisonment}} was unconstitutional. In 2000, a state appellate court determined that prison officials had not violated Rifkin's constitutional rights by housing him in isolation. Rifkin's lawsuit sought $50,000 {{for each of}} his 1,540 days in solitary confinement (totaling $77 million). Had he received any money, {{it would have been}} subject to state laws that earmark most of the award for the families of his victims. Corrections <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Rifkin is now imprisoned with more than 200 other inmates at Clinton who are not allowed into the general prison population.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Democratic Movement (or ADM) {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} {{political}} parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> while members of the ADM also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the Iraq Interim Governing Council briefly (September 2003 - June 2004) guided Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, Younadem Kana, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since 1979.|$|E

25|$|The ICR {{attracted}} much opposition when {{it sought}} approval in Texas {{to operate a}} master's degree program in science education. An April 2008 survey by Texas Freedom Network showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR's request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor. Officials of the institute state {{their goal is to}} integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements ICR <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> scientific literacy will be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR say the institute's true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the group's {{role in the}} Catholic Church, {{critics have}} argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a {{personal}} prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a [...] "church within a church" [...] and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid , which some considered to be irregular. In contrast, Catholic <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and {{its status as a}} prelature [...] "precisely means dependence." [...] Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not {{have anything to do with}} power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} Veracruz {{used to be}} {{controlled}} by the Gulf Cartel before business was handed over to Los Zetas, their former allies, when they went to war across northeastern Mexico in early 2010. Since 2011, much of the drug-related violence {{is a result of the}} turf wars between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico and headed by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. These criminal groups are fighting for Veracruz because of its lucrative smuggling routes for contraband, drug trafficking, and illegal migrants heading to the United States. It has one of Mexico's busiest ports, and <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is no way they can inspect all of the containers that come in by ship. Corruption is also widespread in Veracruz; investigators have been slow and reluctant to link the Martínez Pérez murder to organized crime. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Veracruz is by [...] "general consensus one of the most politically corrupt [...] ". Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for 71 years until it lost the presidential seat to the conservative National Action Party (PAN) in 2000. The PRI has long been criticized for being corrupt and allowing the drug trafficking organizations in the country to operate freely if they maintained relative peace. Although the PRI lost the national presidency in 2000, some states remained under the rule of PRI politicians. [...] "Democratic transition never quite reached Veracruz," [...] a state of 8 million people. PRI governors in Veracruz continued to rule with the state with tactics largely abandoned by the PRI at a national level.|$|E

2500|$|Autzen {{is known}} for its crowd noise. [...] Due to the stadium's {{relatively}} small footprint, the fans are very close to the action, and the field is sunken. [...] These factors contribute to the loudness of the stadium even though it is smaller than other 'noise comparable' stadiums. [...] According to many in the Pac-12, it was actually even louder prior to the most recent expansion because the noise reverberated {{all the way up the}} stadium and bounced back down to the field—the so-called [...] "Autzen bounce." [...] Oregon <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any future expansions will trap more noise.|$|E
2500|$|Five sets of {{remains were}} found {{but could not}} be identified.

Army Military District of Washington officials said the remains which were inextricably commingled {{were excluded from the}} burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist remains were included. These terrorist and commingled remains were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in February 2002. The FBI said the remains were [...] "disposed of in a dignified manner'", although a very small amount of suspected terrorist remains were retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions.|$|E
2500|$|Debate {{continues}} about Nantes' {{place in}} Brittany, with polls indicating {{a large majority}} in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification.

Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire <b>officials,</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged {{the fact that the}} city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is [...] {{similar to that of the}} Pays de la Loire.
