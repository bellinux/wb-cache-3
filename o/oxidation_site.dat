40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{techniques were}} used to derive a predictive model for substrates of cytochrome P 450 2 D 6, an isozyme known to metabolize only compounds {{with one or more}} basic nitrogen atoms. Sixteen substrates, accounting for 23 metabolic reactions, with a distance of either 5 A (" 5 -A substrates", e. g., debrisoquine) or 7 A (" 7 -A substrates", e. g., dextromethorphan) between <b>oxidation</b> <b>site</b> and basic nitrogen atom were fitted into one model by postulating an interaction of the basic nitrogen atom with a negatively charged carboxylate group on the protein. This acidic residue anchors and neutralizes the positively charged basic nitrogen atom of the substrates. In case of " 5 -A substrates" this interaction probably occurs with the carboxylic oxygen atom nearest to the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site,</b> whereas in the case of " 7 -A substrates" this interaction takes place at the other oxygen atom. Furthermore, all substrates exhibit a coplanar conformation near the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site</b> and have negative molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) in a part of this planar domain approximately 3 A away from the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site.</b> No common features were found in the neighbourhood of the basic nitrogen atom of the substrates studied so that this region of the active site can accommodate a variety of N-substituents. Therefore, the substrate specificity of P 450 2 D 6 most likely is determined by the distance between <b>oxidation</b> <b>site</b> and basic nitrogen atom, by steric constraints near the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site,</b> and by the degree of complementarity between the MEPs of substrate and protein in the planar region adjacent to the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site.</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|By {{constructing}} a continuity equation of energy flow, one can utilize {{results from a}} molecular dynamics simulation to calculate the energy flux or flow {{in different parts of}} a biomolecule. Such calculations can yield useful insights into the pathways of energy flow in biomolecules. The method was first tested on a small system of a cluster of 13 argon atoms and then applied {{to the study of the}} pathways of energy flow after a tuna ferrocytochrome c molecule was oxidized. Initially, energy propagated faster along the direction perpendicular to the heme plane. This was due to an efficient through-bond mechanism, because the heme iron in cytochrome c was covalently bonded to a cysteine and a histidine. For the oxidation of cytochrome c, electrostatic interactions also facilitated a long-range through-space mechanism of energy flow. As a result, polar or charged groups that were further away from the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site</b> could receive energy earlier than nonpolar groups closer to the site. Another bridging mechanism facilitating efficient long-range responses to cytochrome c oxidation involved the coupling of far-off atoms with atoms that were nearer to, and interacted directly with, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site.</b> The different characteristics of these energy transfer mechanisms defied a simple correlation between the time that the excess energy of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site</b> first dissipated to an atom and the distance of the atom from the <b>oxidation</b> <b>site.</b> For tuna cytochrome c, all of the atoms of the protein had sensed the effects of the oxidation within approximately 40 fs. For the length scale of energy transfer considered in this study, the speed of the energy propagation in the protein was on the order of 10 (5) m/s...|$|E

40|$|The {{interfacial}} chemistry between Ni and Al 2 O 3 {{has been}} studied during {{the initial stages of}} bonding. We have evaporated thin films of Ni on different alumina substrates (thin oxide film on metallic Al, polished and scratched sapphire crystals, surface with second phase precipitates) and have analyzed how the interface grows, in situ, using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. It was found that a certain fraction of the first monolayer of Ni which forms on the alumina surface undergoes charge transfer to form NiO. This is due to oxygen-active sites such as unattached oxygen bonds on the surface. A measure of the concentration of such sites can therefore be obtained from the submonolayer fraction of Ni that gets oxidized. It was found that a rough surface offered less <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites</b> for Ni than a smooth one whereas a surface with second phase MgAI 2 O 4 (spinel) precipitates offered more <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites.</b> Also, there is much less oxidation on a thin film of amorphous alumina grown on metallic Al than on a polished bulk sapphire surface.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop methods for selection and identification of carbonylated proteins and their <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites.</b> ^ The work reported here began with the research for development of a method for the isolation of oxidized proteins, which involved (1) biotinylation of oxidized proteins with biotin hydrazide and (2) affinity enrichment using monomeric avidin affinity chromatography columns. Using this method 14 peptides and their parent proteins were identified from tryptic digest of oxidized proteins from rat liver homogenates. ^ Next a faster, more targeted method was developed to allow selection and identification of carbonylated petides from the whole proteome which involved (1) labeling oxidized proteins with 1 -(Carboxymethyl) pyridinium chloride (GPR) and (2) enrichment of the labeled peptide using strong cation exchange chromatography followed by identification of <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites</b> using tandem mass spectrometry. ^ This research was followed by development of a more advanced approach which allowed better separation and higher resolution of oxidized proteins. The effects of oxidative stress on the yeast proteome were studied using hydrogen peroxide as the stress agent. Oxidized proteins were isolated by (1) biotinylation of oxidized proteins with biotin hydrazide, (2) affinity selection using monomeric avidin affinity chromatography, and (3) further fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) on a C 8 column.

Proteins often assemble into spatially coordinated complexes of distinct structure, composition, and function. At least 33 % of the proteins in yeast are part {{of one or more}} protein complex at some time. Concerted efforts have been made during the past decade to study the structure, composition, aggregation, dissociation, and function of specific protein complexes along with attempts to understand how external stimuli impact these processes. Even with the expenditure of so much effort, methods for studying the cellular interactome are still not comparable in speed and universality to those used in proteomics and genomics. In this thesis, Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) was incorporated into global proteomics methods {{in such a way that}} proteins in complexes could be recognized, identified, and characterized in response to stimulus from the cellular medium. In the first part of this work, different kinetic conditions such as salt, PH and storage temperature on the stabilities of protein complexes were evaluated. Protein complexes eluted from different fractions of SEC chromatography were identified in optimized conditions, and particular attention was focused on recognizing HUB proteins and their interaction partners. In the second part of this work, by utilizing biotin hydrazide labeling integrated with avidin affinity chromatography, we successfully characterized the <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites</b> on the HUB protein complexes induced by acetic acid treatment. We found that the <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites</b> on distinct complexes are different from each other, which reveals that the binding partners accommodate the tertiary structures of the HUB proteins differently and oxidized parts on the HUB proteins were greatly determined by their accessibility to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>sites</b> were either located on or adjacent to the functional residues of the proteins.
