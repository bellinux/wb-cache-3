IA adds business benefit through the use <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to authorized users and reduces the utility <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Risk Management.|$|E
