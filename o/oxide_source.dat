The synthesized nanostructures are double-layer SiC–W 18 O 49 nanostructure. Based on TEM and EDX analysis, a possible VS growth mechanism was proposed for the grown double-layer nanostructure. At some certain conditions, we observed that W 18 O 49 nanorods having different density (density gradient) can be grown on the SiC nanowires and this is attributed to the mass transport effect of tungsten <b>oxide</b> <b>source</b> material.

Univalent reduction of nitrite was totally inhibited by myxothiazol. We therefore conclude on the involvement of redox cycling that ubisemiquinone {{is associated with the}} bc 1 complex. Recycling of nitric oxide degradation products via these electron carriers may become a threat to energy-linked respiration since nitric oxide in direct contact with mitochondria was shown to slow the energy-linked respiration down and to trigger a mitochondrial source for superoxide radicals.

40|$|Background: High blood {{pressure}} is common in acute stroke and has been linked with poor outcome. Hence, outcome might be improved by lowering {{blood pressure}}. This thesis investigates the potential for glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, for lowering blood pressure in acute stroke. Methods: A systematic review was employed to clarify the relationship between outcome and BP in observational studies. Next two systematic reviews of animal studies using nitric oxide therapeutics in experimental stroke were performed to assess the effects on infarct volume and cerebral perfusion. Finally, two randomised controlled clinical trials of glyceryl trinitrate were performed in acute stroke patients to measure the systemic and cerebral haemodynamic effects. Results: In observational studies high blood pressure in acute stroke was associated with subsequent death, death or dependency, and death or deterioration. In experimental stroke nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>sources</b> and selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitors significantly reduced stroke volume. Glyceryl trinitrate lowered peripheral and central blood pressure and increased aortic compliance when given < 48 hours from stroke. Glyceryl trinitrate did not alter quantitative measures of cerebral perfusion despite significantly lowering blood pressure < 5 days from stroke. Conclusion: High {{blood pressure is}} a therapeutic target in acute stroke and animal data {{support the use of}} nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>sources</b> for lowering blood pressure. It is feasible to use glyceryl trinitrate for this purpose since it does not compromise cerebral perfusion. Trials now need to urgently assess the effect of lowering BP on outcome.

40|$|Laser-induced dot {{transfer}} (LIDT) is one {{of promising}} additive manufacturing techniques be-cause it can realize flexible patterning of micron and submicron-sized dots even at atmospheric room-temperature conditions. In the LIDT process, a laser pulse is tightly focused onto a source film, leading to a transient melting of the film followed by sub-spot transfer using one-to-one mi-crodot deposition with laser-illuminated area. Recently, we have developed a novel double-pulse LIDT process using the first pulse for preheating the source film and the second pulse for dot trans-fer. To investigate the double-pulse effect on microdot transfer of oxides, temporal high-temperature distributions of a thick indium tin <b>oxide</b> <b>source</b> film during double-pulse irradiation have been simu-lated using a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach.

To illustrate this dependence, the deposition rate of nondoped silicon dioxide obtained ona thermal oxide surface is significantly lower than the deposition rate obtained on a bare silicon surface. A new method to eliminate this base material dependence involving plasma treatment has been investigated. The optimum treatment con-sists of exposing the base materials to a nitrogen plasma for 1 min while maintaining the base materials at 250 ~ Films deposited on thermal oxide base materials which have first been treated by this new method were found to have the same deposition rate, aqueous HF etch rate, and surface morphology as those films deposited on untreated bare silicon. In addi-tion to a nitrogen plasma, oxygen and argon plasmas were studied and found to produce similar esults when the base ma-terial temperature was raised to 350 ~ The elimination of base material dependence through the use of this new plasma treatment technique has resulted in higher integrity TEOS/O 3 oxides and has also expanded the range of applications for this unique planarizing technology for very large scale integrated evice fabrication.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Nitric oxide is produced in the vascular endothelium and enteric neural plexuses of the intestine and is involved in gastrointestinal motility and smooth muscle contractility. Little {{is known about the}} role of nitric oxide in intestinal epithelial transport. METHODS: Ten-centimeter rabbit ileal segments (n = 50) were vascularly perfused with an electrolyte solution containing red cells. The lumen was perfused with a solution containing 14 C-PEG. Net fluxes of water and ions were calculated during three 20 -minute periods: basal, drug infusion, and recovery. Perfusion pressure was recorded to document changes in vascular resistance. Agents infused included the nitric oxide synthase substrate L-arginine, the nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>source</b> sodium nitroprusside, the substrate control D-arginine, and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. RESULTS: L-arginine and sodium nitroprusside caused absorption of water and ions. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester caused secretion of water and ions, which was prevented by synchronous infusion of L-arginine. Infusion of D-arginine had no effect. Both L-arginine and sodium nitroprusside caused mild vasodilation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide synthesis by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester causes secretion of water and ions. This secretion is reversed by administration of the nitric oxide synthase substrate L-arginine. These findings are consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} endogenous nitric oxide has a proabsorptive influence over the ileum in the basal state...|$|E

40|$|The nitrite anion (NO– 2) has {{recently}} received much attention as an endogenous nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>source</b> {{that has the}} potential to be supplemented for therapeutic benefit. One major mechanism of nitrite reduction is the direct reaction between this anion and the ferrous heme group of deoxygenated hemoglobin. However, the reaction of nitrite with oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) is well established and generates nitrate and methemoglobin (metHb). Several mechanisms have been proposed that involve the intermediacy of protein-free radicals, ferryl heme, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in an autocatalytic free radical chain reaction, which could potentially limit the usefulness of nitrite therapy. In this study we show that none of the previously published mechanisms is sufficient to fully explain the kinetics of the reaction of nitrite with oxyHb. Based on experimental data and kinetic simulation, we have modified previous models for this reaction mechanism and show that the new model proposed here is consistent with experimental data. The important feature of this model is that, whereas previously both H 2 O 2 and NO 2 were thought to be integral to both the initiation and propagation steps, H 2 O 2 now only plays a role as an initiator species, and NO 2 only plays a role as an autocatalytic propagatory species. The consequences of uncoupling the roles of H 2 O 2 and NO 2 in the reaction mechanism for the in vivo reactivity of nitrite are discussed...|$|E

Carbon isotope stratigraphy (d 13 Corg and d 13 Ccarb) allows accurate recognition of the strata that record the oceanic anoxic event, in some cases allowing characterization of isotopic species before, during, and after the OAE. Within the black shales formed during the OAE, relatively heavy nitrogen isotope ratios, which correlate positively with TOC, suggest nitrate reduction (leading ultimately to denitrification and/or anaerobic ammonium oxidation). Black shales deposited {{before the onset of}} the OAE in Italy have unusually low bulk d 57 Fe values, unlike those found in the black shale (Livello Bonarelli) deposited during the oceanic anoxic event itself: These latter conform to the Phanerozoic norm for organic-rich sediments. Pyrite formation in the pre-OAE black shales has apparently taken place via dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR), within the sediment, a suboxic process that causes an approximately - 2 per mil fractionation between a lithogenic Fe(III) <b>oxide</b> <b>source</b> and Fe(II) aq. In contrast, bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), at least partly in the water column, characterized the OAE itself and was accompanied by only minor iron isotope fractionation. This change in the manner of pyrite formation is reflected in a decrease in the average pyrite framboid diameter from ~ 10 to ~ 7 µm. The gradual, albeit irregular increase in Fe isotope values during the OAE, as recorded in the Italian section, is taken to demonstrate limited isotopic evolution of the dissolved iron pool, consequent upon ongoing water column precipitation of pyrite under euxinic conditions.

Most of this increase is related to [...] For 2013, the AGGI was 1.34 (representing an increase in total direct radiative forcing of 34% since 1990). The increase in [...] forcing alone since 1990 was about 46%. The decline in CFCs considerably tempered the increase in net radiative forcing.|$|R
40|$|Small shelly fossils are {{preserved}} as apatite steinkerns in the Cambrian Series 2 – 3 Thorntonia Limestone, Australia. Petrological observations indicate that phosphorus delivered to Thorntonia sediment was remobilized before precipitating in microenvironments {{defined by the}} matrix-filled interiors of small, mostly conical skeletons. A previous geochemical study concluded that both organic matter and iron <b>oxides</b> <b>sourced</b> phosphorus to Thorntonia sediments, and that anoxia governed phosphorus remobilization within the sediment column. This contribution asks: What factors allowed for the selective preservation of skeleton interiors, and what biases result from this preservation? We find that small shells physically trapped phosphorus-laden pore waters, creating local conditions where kinetic barriers to apatite precipitation could be overcome. Only a subset of Thorntonia Limestone skeletons is preserved by apatite, showing evidence of selectivity with respect to shell size, shape, and orientation. Both the biological and physical factors that govern phosphorus remineralization and precipitation have changed through time, accounting for the opening and closing of the Ediacaran-Cambrian phosphatization taphonomic window. The opening of this window may have required a global increase in phosphate delivery to the oceans...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of silicon-rich oxide and fluorinated oxide (FSiO 4) films deposited in an electron cyclotron res-onance {{chemical vapor deposition}} system with SiR 4 and 02 as the <b>oxide</b> <b>sources</b> and CF 4 as the fluorinating precursor are investigated in this work. According to experimental results, the dangling bonds in Si-rich oxide behave as positively by charged electron traps and degrade the dielectric strength by lowering the barrier height for Fowler-Nordheim tunnel-ing. On the other hand, {{a small amount of}} incorporated F atoms will passivate and neutralize these excess Si dangling bonds, thereby elevating the dielectric strength. However, too much incorporated F will degrade the pretunneling leak-age performance owing to the porosity and fatigues structure in FSiO 4 film. The high leakage and even breakdown at low field strongly limits the incorporated F concentration in FSi 04 film and the lowering of dielectric constant. Infroduction Advances in ultralarge-scale integrated circuits have led to the necessity for an intermetal dielectric (TMD) with the dielectric constant (k) as low as possible to overcome the limitation of signal delay. As a candidate for low-k IMD material, chemical vapor deposition of inorganic fluori...|$|R
