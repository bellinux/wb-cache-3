40|$|The rhombus tilings of a simply {{connected}} {{domain of}} the Euclidean plane are known to form a flip-connected space (a flip is the elementary operation on rhombus tilings which rotates 180 ◦ a hexagon made of three rhombi).

A parte experimental da pesquisa consiste no ensaio de flexão de dez vigas subarmadas de concreto de média e de alta resistência. Nessas vigas empregaram-se dois tipos de armadura: a convencional, de núcleo circular, e a de núcleo <b>octogonal.</b> A finalidade do estudo é comparar o desempenho das emendas feitas com esses dois tipos de armadura e também considerar o efeito conjunto da resistência e do cobrimento do concreto no confinamento das emendas. Constatou-se um desempenho satisfatório e semelhante para emendas feitas com os dois tipos de aço. Os resultados dos ensaios não confirmaram os valores previstos pelas equações das normas internacionais comparadas. ABSTRACT: On this dissertation one {{deals with}} the design of splice length of the tensioned longitudinal reinforcement in reinforced concrete beams subjected to pure bending. Initially, it is presented a report of state-of-the-art technology on the subject matter covering the last twenty five years.

The experimental program of this dissertation consists of the analysis of the behavior of ten flexure tests with normal and highstrength reinforced concrete beams. These beams were made with two kinds of bars: the conventional one, bar of circular cross section and the bar of octagonal cross section. The goal is to compare the splice length performance with these two kinds of reinforcement bar and also to take in account the combined effect of the others parameters like concrete strength and cover with transverse reinforcement confinement. It was evidenced a similar performance at the splices made from two types of reinforcing bar.

The cells are joined together by means of walls whereby four additional octagonal cells are created. Out of these, three are subdivided into four cells and the fourth forms the central silo. Below this unit there is a corridor for the emptying of the silos. &# 13; The work has been carried out with a travelling form with the following characteristics: mixed with regard to shape and materials; stiff, since the top platforms are connected; and it has a constant cross-section as the dimensions of the silos remain the same throughout the whole height. The form was lifted by means of elevation devices, controlled by a centralized hydraulic mechanism. &# 13; In view of the characteristics of the travelling form, the concrete used ¡n the work had to fulfill several very special conditions, notably different from these applying to the concrete that is normally used for fixed forms. For this reason, it was submitted to a great number of studies and tests until the requirements had been met. &# 13; The construction was finished in record time: in the first place, because a detailed programme had been worked out in advance, consisting of a diagram of bars and preference network and secondly, because continuous concreting was applied with day and night shifts, whebery the foreseen {{two and a half months}} for finishing the silos were reduced to 12 days. Estos silos, destinados a almacenamiento de cereales y borujo, están formados por 10 celdas exteriores cilíndricas, de 6 m de diámetro interior y 31, 88 m de altura, que se unen entre sí por medio de muros, dando lugar a cuatro celdas adicionales de forma <b>octogonal.</b> De éstas, tres están subdivididas en cuatro interceldas, quedando la cuarta como silo central.

Pribraja im također šesterolist u Rogačićima kod Blažuja u Bosni i osmerolist iz Ošlja. Sve te građevine u znanosti su već odavno uočene i proučavane kao zasebna tipološka grupa sakralne arhitekture ranoga srednjeg vijeka na tlu Dalmacije. Uz razmatranja samog tipa i forme tih rotonda autor se bavi problemom njihove konstrukcije i funkcije, te drugog sloja s kojim su neke stekle predvorje, pojedine možda i zvonik nad njim, te na taj način zadobile svoju ukupnu povijesnu strukturu. Pažnju poklanja kulturnom ambijentu koji tvore gradovi bizantske Dalmacije, posebno Zadar na prijelazu 8. u 9. stoljeće, grada u kojemu se nalaze građevine važne za čitanje morfoloških i stilskih odlika arhitekture dalmatinskih šesterolista. U vezi s problemom datacije koristi se ponajviše rezultatima pomnih analiza kamene plastike iz tih crkvica. The {{discussion}} {{emphasizes the}} peculiarity and individuality {{of both the}} shape and style of Dalmatian hexaconchs. Together with the rotunda of Holy Trinity at Zadar, they surely represent the most original architectural creation of early medieval Dalmatia and its specific cultural milieu which grew from a two fold tradition in a true symbiosis of the European East and West in the Adriatic area. Their mutual interdependence in Dalmatia was articulated through the individual shapes of religious architecture. These hexaconchs are a form specific to only the innermost part of Dalmatia, centred on the area between Zadar and Split, and deep into the hinterland of these towns, which corresponded to the Croatian principality. Certainly, buildings as special as this had their own original matrix - an individual spatial composition and a specific structure which formed their body. Without this, the hexaconchs would not have possessed the originality which has been observed by all the scholars who have written about them. Indeed, {{they have their own}} shape and style. By analyzing and interpreting the legacy of Dalmatian religious architecture, it seems plausible to assume that the early Christian baptistery of Zadar Cathedral may have served as a model not only for their hexaconchal shape and spatial structure but also for their dimensions and proportions. In the regional architecture prior to the period when the hexaconchs were built, no other building, aside from the Zadar baptistery, had such a shape and such a compositional compatibility with the hexaconchs; the very structure and measurements of their interior space. However, the architectural style of the hexaconchs, which display pilaster strips on their exteriors, and their vocabulary of pre-Romanesque language find their parallels on the monumental rotunda of Holy Trinity - a chapel adjacent to the baptistery itself, located nearby in the same episcopal complex - more than on any other late Antique or early medieval building both in the immediate region and in the whole Adriatic basin. For this reason, the search for the origin of the shape and style of Dalmatian hexaconchs leads us to Zadar and {{it is no wonder that}} almost every scholar who has studied this group of buildings has pointed to this fact. Their geographical distribution also witnesses this influence in its own way: two hexaconchs can be found at Zadar, while four or even five more are located in the wider Zadar area, adding up to seven out of the ten Dalmatian hexaconchs in total. This number implies that this group of rotundas, being characteristic for a specific period in Dalmatia, was created in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, it points to the building and carving workshops which, drawing upon the same source model, constructed the hexaconchs and provided them with stone liturgical furnnishings. In particular, further indications can be found in the production of the socalled Benedictine carving workshop, probably located at Zadar, a workshop from the time of Prince Trpimir which produced the furnishings for the hexaconchs at Pridraga and Kašić, and the carving workshop from Trogir which was responsible for the carvings at Trogir and Brnaze. All of these, with regard to the hexaconchs, testify to predominantly early ninth-century production, and represent the main argument for the dating of these interesting Dalmatian rotundas to the same time. Apart from their original pre-Romanesque shape, the majority of the free-standing hexaconchal rotundas were provided with early Romanesque additions during the course of time, and these additions turned these hexaconchs into small complexes of sorts. Vestibules created in this period suggest two possiblities: according to one, the vestibules added in this manner were actually a kind of exterior crypt, spaces where sarcophagi could be housed, and according to the other, some of these vestibules were also provided with bell-towers built on top of them. The latter possibility is implied by the dispositions of the suggested bell-towers and the strength of the supporting substructions (e. g. the Stomorica church at Zadar or the hexaconch at Kašić), but also by the stylistic elements which point to the early Romanesque, and architectural details, the function of which indicates a bell-tower (e. g. impost capitals of the Stomorica church or St Chrysogonus at Zadar, and an <b>octogonal</b> colonette from Kašić) ...|$|E

O coraÃÂÃÂo, tecido adiposo (gorduras mesentÃÂrica, retroperitoneal e periepididimal), rim e glÃÂndula adrenal esquerda foram pesados. Foi realizada tambÃÂm anÃÂlise histolÃÂgica do coraÃÂÃÂo, adrenal esquerda e hipocampo esquerdo. Os resultados evidenciaram que o grupo de Ec obteve maior tempo de permanÃÂncia nos braÃÂos fechados, o que caracteriza anedonia. Esses resultados indicam que a Baccharis dracunculifolia diminuiu o comportamento ansioso e anedÃÂnico dos animais. Do primeiro ao terceiro dia de treinamento da tarefa de comportamento alimentar, os grupos submetidos ao estresse consumiram maior quantidade de alimentos doces do que os grupos controle. Durante a 1 ÃÂ e a 2 ÃÂ semana, os animais submetidos ou nÃÂo ao estresse nÃÂo apresentaram diferenÃÂas no padrÃÂo alimentar. Entre a 3 ÃÂ e 8 ÃÂ semana que sucederam o experimento, houve uma mudanÃÂa tanto no peso bruto dos animais quanto no ÃÂndice de Lee.

The animals were exposed to stress for a period of 40 days. In this period, one stressor was chosen daily and randomically between the followings: cold exposure, immobilization, the tilt-housing box, flashing light, food deprivation, forced swimming and absence of shavings exchange. After the last stress session, the animals were submitted to the followings behavioral tasks: elevated plus maze, open field task, measurement of palatable food intake, radial arm maze. The day after the last behavioral task session, the animals were euthanized through decapitation. Trunk blood was collected for biochemical analysis (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and corticosterone). Heart, adipose tissue (mesenteric, retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat), left kidney and left adrenal gland were weighed. Also, it was performed histological analysis of the heart, left adrenal and left hippocampus. The results showed that the Ec group obtained the highest time spent in the closed arms, which features anhedonia. These results indicate that Baccharis dracunculifolia reversed anxious and anhedonic behavior in animals. The first to the third day of training for feeding behavior task, groups submitted to stress consumed more sweet food than the control group. During the 1 st and 2 nd weeks, the animals submitted or not to stress showed no differences in dietary patterns. Between 3 rd and 8 th weeks that followed the experiment, there were changes in both the gross weight of the animals and the Lee index. Concerning the biochemical parameters it can be seen that corticosterone levels in animals Ec and Ec / 400 was significantly higher than the other groups. The Baccharis dracunculifolia also seems to facilitate the learning process and improves performance in the reference memory tasks. There was a significant increase in systolic and average pressure in the Ec group. This study showed that Baccharis dracunculifolia provides benefits of both mnemonic activities, as the plant seems to facilitate the learning process, and its cardioprotective effect. However, more studies are needed to better understand the benefits of Baccharis dracunculifolia and the processes involved in chronic stress...|$|E

Frane u Splitu otkriveno je nekoliko starokršćanskih spomenika: dva natpisa (danas izgubljena), sarkofag s prikazom motiva Prelaska Izraelaca preko Crvenoga mora, {{fragment}} s prikazom Krista i apostola te najvjerojatnije i motivom Davida i Golijata, pilastar s urezanim križem, fragment akroterija sarkofaga s križem te omanji fragment pluteja s ljiljanom. Današnja crkva sv. Frane uništila je prethodni samostan i crkvu, koje je u XI. st. podigao splitski nadbiskup Ivan IV. Čini se da je tu bilo i ranijih građevina iz starokršćanskog doba. Na temelju nalaza, osobito importiranih i lokalnih sarkofaga, može se pretpostaviti da se radi o važnom lokalitetu na kojem je izvorno mogao biti pokopan salonitanski mučenik Feliks. The Split archaedeacon Thomas from 13 th century {{states that}} the Split archbishop John the 4 th had built the church of St. Felix on {{the place of the}} present-day monastery of St. Francis (Sv. Frane). The archbishop John died in 1060 AD. St. Felix must have been a local saint who was mentioned in Chronicon Paschale (late 4 th century AD) as fellow sufferer of the Salonitan bishop and martyr Domnio (+ April 10 th 304). This is not Felix mentioned in Usuardo’s martyrologium as some Split scholars supposed, since this belonged to the city of Hispellum (present-day Spello) in Italy. Some old groundplans from the time preceding the reconstruction of the monastery seem to have certain elements of Early Christian architecture as evidenced by an <b>octogonal</b> structure {{to the north of the}} the church which might have been the baptistery or a mausoleum (fig. 1). There are a number of other monuments suggesting that St. Francis was built on an important Early Christian site. The paper lists all the fi nds beginning with the two lost inscriptions which were published in CIL III 2043 and 2107 (8589). The complete texts of these inscriptions might be red in the Croatian text. Both belonged to sarcophagi fragments. They do not contain any direct Christian formulation or symbol. The inscriptions are dating from the late 3 rd to the early 4 th century AD. The dead persons were metal workers in the factory of weapons in Salona which is testifi ed by Notitia Dignitatum (c. 8). The inscriptions contain also some other formulations. A remearkable Christian sarcophagus showing the Red Sea Crossing testifi es even more to the importance of this site (fig. 2). This marble sarcophagus is one of the fi nest and best preserved with this theme. On the right side two young apostles glorifying the Christ monogramme surrounded by a wreath on the plastically rendered cross were shown (fig. 4). Only the squamae decoration is executed on the left side (fig. 3) while on the back young apsotles in the corners (fi gs 6, 7) and a female orans (with her arms stretched and velatio capitis) in the centre (fig. 5). The latter represents either the institution of the Church or Virgin Mary. The sarcophagus was made around 390 AD. It was the import either from Rome or from southern Gaul. Another fragment of a sarcophagus produced in Rome or in Gaul showing three persons is walled into the southern wall of the cloister (fig. 8). The fi rst fi gure to the left is a soldier in the armour and with a shield. The two persons to the right must have been apostles with scrolls in their hands. Such a combination of a soldier and apostles is not familiar on such sarcophagi. However, the scene to the left depicts very probably the duel between Goliath (the soldier) and David who must have been shown with the catapult to the left (there are some slight remains of a fi gure). It is quite sure that to the right was the scene of apostles and the Christ, but it is not known the number of apostles. Their number must have been reduced (probably only three on each side of Christ).). This fragment very likely belonged to the sarcophagus body, since scenes of the Christ with apostles did not appear on the lid. The sarcophagus was probably a small one (child’s dimensions). The fragment is dating also from the end of the 4 th century. A small pilaster (a part of a window) with large cross inscribed on its front side was walled into the western part of the southern church wall (fig. 9). Letter N and fi ve arm star were cut at the top later. Also a circle with the cross and letter A were cut at the bottom. The meaning and the time of execution of these letters and signs are not known. A sarcophagus acroterion of a sarcophagus with deeply cut cross is walled up into the side door of the church of St. Francis (fig. 10). This acroterion is very similar to Salonitan ones. On the opposite side of the same door a fragment of altar or ambo screen slab was also walled up (fig. 11). This fragment contains a lily blossom in the left corner of the bottom. Altogether seven ancient or Early Christian monuments have been found in S. Francis’s church. Ancient graves were found in the vicinity. Fragment of a burial relief is walled up in Ban Mladenova street. A stele containing an ancient epitaph is built in the Plinarska street, while Early Christian fragments were found in St. Mikula (St. Nicolas) church which is also near. All these fi nds testify to the existence of an important archaeological site around the St. Francis’s Church. Therefore the possibility that martyr Felix might have been buried there is very probable...|$|E
