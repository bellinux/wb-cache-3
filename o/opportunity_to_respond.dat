25|$|The {{right to}} be heard was found to have been contravened in Kay Swee Pin v. Singapore Island Country Club (2008). The {{appellant}} had applied {{to be a member of}} the respondent club, and had declared in the application form that a certain individual was her spouse. Soon after, the club's general committee discovered that there were discrepancies in the appellant's marriage certificate. The general committee then charged the appellant with falsely declaring that the individual was her spouse, and referred the matter to the club's disciplinary committee which came to the opposite conclusion. The general committee declined to adopt the disciplinary committee's conclusion and subsequent recommendations, and terminated the appellant's membership. One of the grounds of the appeal was that there had been breaches of natural justice because, among other things, the appellant had not been given an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the general committee in the first place. On the Court of Appeal's behalf, Chan Sek Keong C.J. ruled for the appellant. He held that if the general committee had wanted to be the primary fact finder, then it should have allowed the appellant to respond to the allegations of discrepancies in her marriage certificate. Moreover, since the disciplinary committee had heard the appellant and found her explanation credible, the general committee should have asked itself why the former had so concluded.|$|E

Twenty-four kindergarten children with delayed phonemic segmentation skills were taught to segment phonemes through a 20 -lesson, 10 -minutes-per-day, group intervention with two levels of scaffolding. The two experimental conditions each contained 12 students (one subgroup each of three, four, and five students) who had been matched on their segmentation pretest performance and randomly assigned to an instructional condition. One group was taught to segment with two-dimensional boxes serving as concrete phonemic representations and another group participated in a strictly verbal format. A curriculum, including a six-skill hierarchy, was developed based on principles of effective phonological awareness instruction for diverse learners. Scripted, small-group lessons and individual booster sessions were conducted in general-education classrooms to develop skill mastery. A 2 x 6 randomized block design examined effects across six segmentation measures (pretest, three progress monitoring checks, posttest, and skill maintenance check). Growth in phonemic blending was also assessed as a measure of generalization. Instructional efficiency was gauged by evaluating student <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> and error ratios during instruction. Student satisfaction was also examined across conditions. Analyses revealed that both instructional conditions resulted in improved student performance on every segmentation measure; however, {{there were no significant differences}} between the instructional conditions for first sound, onset-time, segmenting all phonemes, or total segmenting scores. The concrete condition resulted in a statistically significant superior performance on the blending measure. The experimental conditions did not differ statistically on measures of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> and error ratios, the measures of instructional efficiency. Statistically significant differences were noted for group size, as smaller instructional groups performed better than larger groups on total segmenting gains, <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond,</b> and error ratios.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} quality of the writing tasks {{assigned}} to native Spanish speakers in bilingual (Spanish-English) contexts, and the relationship between task quality and students' use of an academic register in their native language. Fifty-six language arts tasks were collected from 26 grade 4 and 5 teachers, and four student writing samples were collected in response to each task (N = 224). Multilevel modeling revealed that variation in students' use of key features of academic language in their writing was associated with the cognitive demand of writing tasks. Findings suggest that students' <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> challenging tasks when writing in their native language are rare and that the rigor of writing tasks may relate to students' production and development of academic language. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

The authors of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise in the area of the article. It and Zentralblatt für Mathematik are the only comprehensive resources of this type. (The Mathematics section of Referativny Zhurnal is available only in Russian and is smaller in scale and difficult to access.)

Research indicates that increased presentation of teacher-directed <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> (TD-OTR), an evidence-based classroom management strategy with demonstrated positive impacts on student academic and behavioral outcomes, may be one of the most critical classroom management practices available to teachers. I aimed to use an experimental single subject multiple baseline design across teachers, to examine the effects of a targeted professional development package (including self-management package and performance feedback) on increasing teachers’ presentation of TD-OTRs and the resulting impacts of teacher behavior change on student academic and behavioral outcomes. Due to teachers’ positive response to universal intervention, a functional relation between targeted PD and teacher behavior was not documented (i. e., experimental control was not achieved). Therefore, within this dissertation, I present five case studies. These case studies detail the increases in teachers’ rates of presentation of TD-OTRs when the universal and, for one teacher, targeted PD was implemented and present outcomes for students’ academic and social behavior. Results indicate that providing classroom management PD within an MTSS framework may be an effective strategy for increasing teachers’ rates of presentation of TD-OTRs. In addition, 3 low-risk and 3 moderate/high-risk students within each classroom demonstrated sustained or increased academic engagement and decreased disruptive behavior as teachers increased their rates of TD-OTR presentation. However, measures of students’ oral reading fluency did not indicate growth during the intervention phase. Implications for policy makers, practitioners, and researchers are discussed in detail...|$|R

Findings from a multimethod study of nonindustrial private forest owners in eastern Oregon suggest four unique subgroups of owners with different fuel management motivations and suitabilities for policy tools: commodity managers could benefit from market-based incentives; amenity managers could benefit from capacity building programs paired with symbolic campaigns; recreational managers could benefit from public incentives provided through consultants or contractors who can help plan the work; and passive managers may benefit from <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the policy strategies designed for the other groupings until more information can be gathered.
