5000|$|Perhaps as {{a result}} of his {{substance}} abuse, Leiber seems to have suffered periods of penury in the 1970s; Harlan Ellison has written of his anger at finding that the much-awarded Leiber had to write his novels on a manual typewriter that was propped up <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> in his apartment, and Marc Laidlaw wrote that, when visiting Leiber as a fan in 1976, he [...] "was shocked to find him occupying one small room of a seedy San Francisco residence hotel, its squalor relieved mainly by walls of books". Other reports suggest that Leiber preferred to live simply in the city, spending his money on dining, movies and travel. In the last years of his life, royalty checks from TSR, Inc. (the makers of Dungeons and Dragons, who had licensed the mythos of the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser series) were enough in themselves to ensure that he lived comfortably.|$|E

5000|$|...NET Remoting makes a {{reference}} of a remotable object {{available to a}} client application, which then instantiates and uses a remotable object {{as if it were}} a local object. However, the actual code execution happens at the server-side. A remotable object is identified by Activation URLs and are instantiated by a connection to the URL. A listener for the object is created by the remoting runtime when the server registers the channel that is used to connect to the remotable object. At the client side, the remoting infrastructure creates a [...] that stands-in as a pseudo-instantiation of the remotable object. It does not implement the functionality of the remotable object, but presents a similar interface. As such, the remoting infrastructure needs to know the public interface of the remotable object beforehand. Any method calls made against the object, including the identity of the method and any parameters passed, are serialized to a byte stream and transferred over a communication protocol-dependent [...] to a recipient proxy object at the server side ("marshalled"), by writing to the Channel's transport sink. At the server side, the proxy reads the stream off the sink and makes the call to the remotable object on the behalf of the client. The results are serialized and transferred <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> to the client, where the proxy reads the result and hands it over to the calling application. If the remotable object needs to make a callback to a client object for some services, the client application must mark it as remotable and have a remoting runtime host a listener for it. The server can connect to it over a different Channel, or over the already existent one if the underlying connection supports bidirectional communication. A channel can be composed of a number of different Channel objects, possibly with different heterogeneous transports. Thus, remoting can also work across systems separated by an interconnection of heterogeneous networks, including the internet. Type safety is enforced by the CTS and the [...]NET Remoting runtime. Remote method calls are inherently synchronous; asynchronous calls can be implemented using threading libraries. Authentication and access control can be implemented for clients by either using custom Channels or by hosting the remotable objects in IIS and then using the IIS authentication system.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine CO 2 {{emission}} hot spots and sink regions over India as identified from global model simulations {{during the period}} 2000 – 2009. CO 2 emission hot spots overlap with locations of densely clustered thermal power plants, coal mines and other industrial and urban centres; CO 2 sink regions coincide with the locations of dense forest. Fossil fuel CO 2 emissions are compared with two bottom-up inventories: the Regional Emission inventories in ASia (REAS v 1. 11; 2000 – 2009) and the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v 4. 2) (2000 – 2009). Estimated fossil fuel emissions over the hot spot region are [*]∼[*]  500 – 950  gC m − 2  yr − 1 as obtained from the global model simulation, EDGAR v 4. 2 and REAS v 1. 11 emission inventory. Simulated total fluxes show increasing trends, from 1. 39  ±  1. 01  % yr − 1 (19. 8  ±  1. 9  TgC yr − 1) to 6. 7  ±  0. 54  % yr − 1 (97  ±  12  TgC yr − 1) over the hot spot regions and decreasing trends of − 0. 95  ±  1. 51  % yr − 1 (− 1  ±  2  TgC yr − 1) to − 5. 7  ±  2. 89  % yr − 1 (− 2. 3  ±  2  TgC yr − 1) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> regions.

Decreasing trends in terrestrial ecosystem fluxes imply that forest cover is increasing, {{which is consistent with}} India State of Forest Report (2009). Fossil fuel emissions show statistically significant increasing trends in all the data sets considered in this study. Estimated trend in simulated total fluxes over the Indian region is [*]∼[*]  4. 72  ±  2. 25  % yr − 1 (25. 6  TgC yr − 1) which is slightly higher than global growth rate [*]∼[*]  3. 1  % yr − 1 during 2000 – 2010...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the calculation of bimolecular association constants for partially diffusion-limited reactions between asymmetric species (e. g. the ligand binding site of a macromolecule covers {{only a portion of}} its surface) is presented. The usual formulation, which is almost always analytically intractable, is based on the solution of a steady-state rotational-translational diffusion equation subject to the mixed boundary conditions that (A) the ligand concentration vanishes over the reactive part of the macromolecular surface and (B) the flux vanishes over the remainder. We show that if A is replaced by the requirement that the flux is a constant over the reactive part of the macromolecular surface and this constant is evaluated by requiring the concentration to vanish on the average <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> region, a whole class of problems can be solved analytically. We consider both the translational and rotational diffusion of the reactants and treat partially diffusion-controlled reactions using the so-called radiation boundary condition. To establish the validity of our approach, we study a simple model using the usual mixed as well as our boundary conditions. As illustrations of our method, we analytically solve and analyze the properties of two models that have been previously studied using numerical methods...|$|E
40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{measurements}} {{have been}} carried out in order to analyze the structure of free surface vortices in a promoting geometry with two tangential inlets. Velocity fields associated to the free surface vortex have been obtained at different horizontal planes and Reynolds numbers. Average velocity fields have been calculated and tangential velocity profiles have been compared at different vortex stages and measurement planes. The results show that tangential flow is uniform along the vortex axis and it scales well with the average exit velocity. The tangential velocity profiles, in comparison to the potential behavior, show discrepancies especially at large distances from the vortex axis. Vorticity fields and circulation profiles have been also derived from the measured velocity fields and discussed. The circulation profiles increase along the vortex radius even at large distances from the vortex axis, so that the potential solution is not applicable at all. The comparison of tangential velocity and circulation profiles between promoted and free vortices, the last presented in a previous paper, shows that the tangential motion in a driven vortex is more intense and predominant <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> effect (radial motion), except very close to the tank bottom, as in a forced configuration (i. e. rotating cylindrical tank) ...|$|E

50|$|A butler's sink is a {{rectangular}} ceramic sink with a rounded rim {{which is set}} into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler's sinks: <b>The</b> London <b>sink</b> and <b>the</b> Belfast <b>sink.</b> In 2006, both types of sinks usually were 61 cm across and 46 cm front-to-back, with a depth of 22.5 cm. London sinks were originally shallower than Belfast sinks. (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that <b>the</b> Belfast <b>sink</b> was 38 cm deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely <b>the</b> two <b>sinks</b> had different roles within the household. But that difference usually {{does not exist in}} the modern era, and both sinks are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London <b>sink</b> is that <b>the</b> Belfast <b>sink</b> is fitted with an overflow weir which prevented water from spilling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink's</b> edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.|$|R
