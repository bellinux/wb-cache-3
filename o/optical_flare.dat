40|$|GRB 050904 is very {{interesting}} since it {{is by far the}} most distant GRB event known to date (z = 6. 29). It was reported that during the prompt high energy emission phase, a very bright <b>optical</b> <b>flare</b> was detected, and it was temporal coincident with an X-ray flare. Here we use two models to explain the <b>optical</b> <b>flare,</b> One is the “late internal shock model”, in which the <b>optical</b> <b>flare</b> is produced by the synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by the late internal shock, and the X-ray flare is produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. The other is the external forward-reverse shock model, in which the <b>optical</b> <b>flare</b> is from the reverse shock emission and the X-ray flare is attributed to the central engine activity. We show that with proper parameters, a bright <b>optical</b> <b>flare</b> can appear in both models. We think the ”late internal shock model ” is more favored since in this model the optical flash and the X-ray flare have the same origin, which provides a natural explanation of the temporal coincidence of them.

In the second scenario, the first <b>optical</b> <b>flare</b> is the low energy prompt emission and the second one is the reverse shock of the initial outflow. Within this scenario we can interpret the late afterglow emission self-consistently.

40|$|The many {{similarities}} between the prompt emission pulses in gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray flares during the fast decay and afterglow phases of GRBs suggest a common origin. In the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs, this common origin is mass accretion episodes of fall-back matter on a newly born compact object. The prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly relativistic plasmoids (CBs) ejected in the early, major episodes of mass accretion. As the accretion material is consumed, one may expect the engine's activity to weaken. X-ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the afterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion. The common engine, environment and radiation mechanisms (inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation) produce their observed similarities. Flares in both long GRBs and short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs) can also be produced by bipolar ejections of CBs following a phase transition in compact objects due to loss of angular momentum and/or cooling. <b>Optical</b> <b>flares,</b> however, are mostly produced in collisions of CBs with massive stellar winds/ejecta or with density bumps along their path.

Changes in both the magnetic field and the particle acceleration efficiency are explored as causes of flares. Generally, external Compton (EC) emission appears to describe the available data better than a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario, and in particular orphan <b>optical</b> <b>flares</b> are difficult to produce in the SSC framework.

During this campaign, HR 1099 was observed almost continuously for more than 8 orbits of 28. Two large <b>optical</b> <b>flares</b> were observed, both showing {{an increase in the}} emission of Hα, Ca ii H & K, Hβ and He i D_ 3 and a strong filling-in of the Na i D_ 1,D_ 2 doublet. Contemporary photometric observations were carried out with the robotic telescopes APT- 80 of Catania and Phoenix- 25 of Fairborn Observatories. Maps of the distribution of the spotted regions on the photosphere of the binary components were derived using the Maximum Entropy and Tikhonov photometric regularization criteria. Rotational modulation was observed in Hα and He i D_ 3 in anti-correlation with the photometric light curves. Both flares occurred at the same binary phase (0. 85), suggesting that these events took place in the same active region. Simultaneous X-ray observations, performed by ASM on board RXTE, show several flare-like events, some of which correlate well with the observed <b>optical</b> <b>flares.</b> Rotational modulation in the X-ray light curve has been detected with minimum flux when the less active G 5 V star was in front. A possible periodicity in the X-ray flare-like events was also found. Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, accepted by A&...|$|R
