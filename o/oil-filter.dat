30|$|At present, the {{research}} study on practical uses of BNNT is extensively and continually conducted. For instance, in water purification, BNNTs has been examined in <b>oil-filtering</b> [69], self-cleaning membranes [70], and reusable heat-resistive films [71]. In {{the field of}} biological application, due to the nontoxicity property, BNNTs {{can be used as}} a biological probe [72], drug carrier [73], or biological channel in biosensor [74]. High stability towards oxidation of BNNTs has enabled its access to field emission technology [75, 76]. In addition, BNNT has also been reported in hydrogen storage [77 – 80], sensing [81, 82], and optoelectronic [83, 84]. It is highly anticipated that the application of BNNT will continue to extend in the future.|$|R
40|$|Chloroplasts were {{isolated}} from ruptured guard-cell protoplasts of the Argenteum mutant of Pisum sativum L. and purified by centrifugation through a Percoll layer. The combined {{volume of the}} intact plastids and the uptake of phosphate were determined by silicone <b>oil-filtering</b> centrifugation, using tritiated water and [14 C]sorbitol as membrane-permeating and nonpermeating markers and [32 P]phosphate as tracer for phosphate. The affinities of the phosphate translocator for organic phosphates were assessed by competition with inorganic phosphate. The affinities for dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3 -phosphoglycerate (PGA), and phosphoenolpyruvate {{were in the same}} order as those reported for mesophyll chloroplasts of several species. However, the guard-cell phosphate translocator had an affinity for glucose- 6 -phosphate that was as high as that for PGA. Guard-cell chloroplasts share this property with amyloplasts from the root of pea (H. W. Heldt, U. I. Flugge, S. Borchert [1991] Plant Physiol 95 : 341 - 343). An ability to import glucose- 6 -phosphate enables guard-cell chloroplasts to synthesize starch despite the reported absence of a fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase activity in the plastids, which would be required if only C 3 phosphates could enter through the translocator...|$|R

40|$|This Third Quarterly report {{details the}} ongoing fleet {{evaluation}} {{of an oil}} bypass filter technology by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) for the U. S. Department of Energy’s FreedomCAR & Vehicle Technologies Program. Eight full-size, four-cycle diesel-engine buses used to transport INEEL employees on various routes have been equipped with oil bypass filter systems from the PuraDYN Corporation. The reported engine lubricating <b>oil-filtering</b> capability (down to 0. 1 microns) and additive package of the bypass filter system is intended to extend oil-drain intervals. To validate the extended oil-drain intervals, an oil-analysis regime monitors the presence of necessary additives in the oil, detects undesirable contaminants and engine wear metals, and evaluates the fitness of the oil for continued service. The eight buses have accumulated 185, 000 miles to date without any oil changes. The preliminary economic analysis suggests that the per bus payback point for the oil bypass filter technology should be between 108, 000 miles when 74 gallons of oil use is avoided and 168, 000 miles when 118 gallons of oil use is avoided. As discussed in the report, the variation in the payback point is dependant on the assumed cost of oil. In anticipation of also evaluating oil bypass systems on six Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicles, the oil is being sampled on the six Tahoes to develop an oil characterization history for each engine...|$|R
40|$|Eighty mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6803 {{that require}} high CO 2 for growth were {{examined}} {{with a mass}} spectrometer {{for their ability to}} take up CO 2 in the light. Two of these mutants (type A) did not show any CO 2 uptake {{while the rest of the}} mutants (type B) took up CO 2 actively. Type A mutants (RKa and RKb) and one type B mutant (RK 11) were partially characterized. At 3 % CO 2, growth rates of the mutants and the wild type (WT) were similar. Under air levels of CO 2, growth of RKa and RKb was very slow, and RK 11 did not grow at all. The photosynthetic affinities for inorganic carbon (Ci) in these three mutants were about 100 times lower than the affinity in WT. The following characteristics of type A mutants indicated that the mutants have a defect in their CO 2 -transport system: (a) the activity of 13 C 18 O 2 uptake in RKa and RKb in the light was less than 5 % the activity in WT, and (b) each mutant had only a low level of activity of 14 CO 2 uptake as measured by the method of silicone <b>oil-filtering</b> centrifugation. The HCO 3 −-transport system was also impaired in these mutants. The activity of H 14 CO 3 − uptake was negligibly low in RKb and was one-third the activity of WT in RKa. On the other hand, the type B mutant, RK 11, transported CO 2 and HCO 3 − into the intracellular Ci pool as actively as WT but was unable to utilize it for photosynthesis. Complementation analysis of type A mutants indicated that RKa and RKb have mutations in different regions of the genome. These results suggested that at least two kinds of proteins are involved in the Ci-transport system...|$|R
5000|$|Piston-ring {{compressors}} are strap wrenches that evenly squeeze (compress) {{the piston}} rings around a piston {{long enough to}} slide it into a cylinder. They {{look a lot like}} an <b>oil-filter</b> wrench of the strap type ( [...] Except they are a flat piece of metal that wraps around the piston). If no wrench is available, an old piston ring snapped into two halves can be used to compress each of the new rings as the piston is inserted.|$|E
