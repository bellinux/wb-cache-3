The series has {{therefore}} not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings the two teams already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will be exactly the same as before the series. There is therefore no points 'inflation' in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> meaningful.|$|E

The Treasury did a study in 2007 that tracked the same individual taxpayers {{over the age of}} 25 from 1996 to 2005 and found differing results from what the graph above shows. The results showed that during those years, half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile, with half of those in the bottom quintile moving to a higher one. About 60% of taxpayers in the top 1% in 1996 no longer stayed in that category by 2005.|$|E
500|$|The most record-breaking tornado in {{recorded}} history was the Tri-State Tornado, which roared through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It was likely an F5, though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length (...) , longest duration (about 3.5 hours), and fastest forward speed {{for a significant}} tornado (...) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history (695 dead). The tornado was also the costliest tornado in history at the time (unadjusted for inflation), but {{in the years since}} has been surpassed by several others if population changes <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> not considered.

2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that visual examination, or monitoring, cannot 'clear' a person of risk. It can only say what their condition is at the time. If at any point in their life the person develops numerous polyps, this would tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP. (Absence of polyps does not 'clear' a person, as polyps can develop later in life; also a few polyps <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> not that uncommon in people without FAP. However a substantial number or a profusion of polyps would generally tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP, and histopathology to determine whether or not any polyps are cancerous.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{sounds that}} are heard in {{everyday}} life are not characterized by a single frequency. Instead, they consist of a sum of pure sine frequencies, each one at a different amplitude. When humans hear these frequencies simultaneously, we can recognize the sound. This is true for both [...] "non-musical" [...] sounds (e.g. water splashing, leaves rustling, etc) and for [...] "musical sounds" [...] (e.g. a piano note, a bird's tweet, etc). This set of parameters (frequencies, their relative amplitudes, and how the relative amplitudes change <b>over</b> <b>time)</b> <b>are</b> encapsulated by the timbre of the sound. Fourier analysis is the technique {{that is used to}} determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal; conversely, the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the Fourier series of the original sound signal.|$|E
2500|$|The Goa'uld {{possess a}} genetic memory passed {{directly}} from parent to offspring, which perpetuates {{the evil of}} the Goa'uld through generations. Most Goa'uld are asexual, though they usually take on the gender of their preferred host. The exception are the Goa'uld Queens, who <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>are</b> able to spawn millions of larvae, once seeded with genetic material from another Goa'uld or even a human.

Goa'uld larvae that mature in the wild have only a 50% chance of successfully taking a host; the Goa'uld engineered the Jaffa as incubators to improve these odds. The human offspring of two Goa'uld hosts is known as a Harcesis. The conception of Harcesis children is forbidden, as they would contain the genetic memories of both Goa'uld parents and thus pose a major threat to the established Goa'uld order.|$|E
