Being a single degree-of-freedom mechanism as defined by its crank angle, the program {{can be used to}} answer ―what-if ‖ scenario questions through tables and graphical plots to evaluate variations of key motion and loading parameters with changes in the crank angle. The program also allows for the conduct of parameter studies in selecting optimum crank-and-connecting-rod linkage dimensions and speeds. Extreme positions are accounted for in the inline model using the Ching-U and Price model equations.

One new efficient tool is sample adaptive offset (SAO), which classifies reconstructed samples into different categories, and reduces the distortion by adding an offset to samples of each category. Two SAO types are adopted in HEVC: edge offset (EO) and band offset (BO). Four 1 -D directional edge patterns are used in edge <b>offset</b> <b>type,</b> and only one is selected for each CTB. However, single directional pattern cannot remove artifacts effectively for the CTBs, which contain edges in different directions.

Achievement of mandated water quality standards has increasingly focused on the role of nonpoint pollution source (NPS) discharges, in particular, runoff of nutrients from agricultural activities.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the seismic response of geosynthetic reinforced retaining walls through shaking table tests on models of modular block and rigid faced reinforced retaining walls. Reduced-scale models of retaining walls reinforced with geogrid layers were constructed in a laminar box {{mounted on a}} uniaxial shaking table and subjected to various levels of sinusoidal base shaking. Models were instrumented with ultrasonic displacement sensors, earth pressure sensors and accelerometers. Effects of backfill density, number of reinforcement layers and reinforcement type {{on the performance of}} rigid faced and modular block walls were studied through different series of model tests. Performances of the walls were assessed in terms of face deformations, crest settlement and acceleration amplification at different elevations and compared. Modular block walls performed better than the rigid faced walls for the same level of base shaking because of the additional support derived by stacking the blocks with an <b>offset.</b> <b>Type</b> and quantity of reinforcement has significant effect on the seismic performance of both the types of walls. Displacements are more sensitive to relative density of the backfill and decrease with increasing relative density, the effect being more pronounced in case of unreinforced walls compared to the reinforced ones. Acceleration amplifications are not affected by the wall facing and inclusion of reinforcement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Many {{semiconductor}} devices now contain barriers, i. e. potential discontinuities for electron transport, that are submitted to an electric field {{perpendicular to the}} barrier interface. Basically, two types of barriers exist (see Fig. 1). There are barriers induced by two successive and opposite band offsets large enough compared to kT. There are thin layers of a material embedded in another one and exhibiting a band offset (such as GaAlAs in GaAs), that we shall refer to as rectangular barriers (Fig. 1 a). The triangular barriers, induced by a single offset, develop at the interface between two different materials doped with the same type {{in such a way}} that a space charge layer is induced by the offset (Fig. 1 b).

InAsSb/InGaAs strained-layer superlattices (SLS) and InAsSb quantum wells were characterized using magneto-photoluminescence and compared with unstrained InAsSb and InAs alloys. In heterostructures with biaxially compressed InAsSb, large quantum confinement energies were observed, and the holes exhibited {{a decrease in}} effective mass, approaching that of the electrons.

The antenna subsystem requires the target surface accuracy of 0. 4 mm-rms on the main reflector of about 10 m in diameter. An off-axis paraboloid reflector is composed of seven deployable modular antennas, {{and each of the}} modules employs a new idea of radial-rib/hoop-cable reflector construction to stretch knitted metal fabric surface and to satisfy the required surface accuracy for millimeter-wave observation.

40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and the ring cam, which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and <b>offset</b> <b>types</b> of units...|$|R

50|$|The {{view that}} the {{temporary}} removal of negative gearing between 1985 and 1987 caused rents to rise has been challenged by Chief Economist of the ANZ Saul Eslake, who has been quoted as saying: It's true, according to Real Estate Institute data, that rents went up in Sydney and Perth.

They rose strongly in every Australian capital city, according to the official ABS CPI data.
