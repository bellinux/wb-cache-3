40|$|After proven {{performance}} in gas turbine secondary flow and hot gas path sealing applications, brush seals are {{being considered for}} oil and oil mist applications in aero-engines and industrial turbines. In <b>oil</b> <b>sealing</b> applications shear heating and oil coking are major concerns. The field experience indicates that shear heating and oil coking issues can be managed if seal is designed properly. When seal stiffness is well controlled, combined with proper fiber material selection and leakage cooling, shear heating and oil coking issues can be managed. Field experience from early gas turbine bearing sump applications suggest reduced oil mist ingestion and compressor blade fouling with no observable coking issues. Brush seal operating clearance determines leakage rate and oil temperature rise. Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria requires the knowledge of bristle hydrodynamic lift. In this work, some background on analytical solution to bristle lifting force and shear heating is presented. Based on short bearing approximation, the analytical solution suggests a strong dependence of seal clearance and hydrodynamic lift force on oil temperature and viscosity.

40|$|TutorialTutorial 19 C: Dry {{gas seals}} are {{specified}} {{in most of}} the new centrifugal compressors; yet many installed units are still equipped with conventional <b>oil</b> <b>sealing</b> systems. The benefits of dry gas seals conversions from traditional oil seals to dry gas seals are usually advantageous to compressor operators. However, end users should ask themselves several questions before deciding to retrofit their compressors with dry gas seals. The decision to retrofit a compressor with these upgraded seals may be dictated by economic factors, HSE constraints or technical considerations. Users should consider all of these factors when deciding whether or not to upgrade a compressor with dry gas seals. In addition, the following precautions should be taken during project execution to ensure successful conversion: perform a detailed physical integration analysis of the dry gas seal in the existing compressor; conduct a detailed rotor dynamic analysis; select the proper gas seal system design for the compressor; and plan for operator training. This paper will discuss the factors end users should consider before upgrading to dry gas seals together with an economic evaluation, and the steps that should be taken to ensure a successful conversion once the decision is made to retrofit a compressor with dry gas seals...|$|E

40|$|Brush seals {{are used}} in gas Turbine engine {{applications}} for their effectiveness in controlling leakage flows between stationary parts and rotating shaft With their superior leakage performance, they are becoming the successor to the labyrinth seals, which have always been widely used since the first gas turbine engines. After gaining popularity in secondary flow air sealing, applications extended to more challenging oil and oil mist sealing locations. Due to high rotor surface speed oil temperature rise and coking become main issues in addition to leakage performance. While each bristle forms very small bearing surface. high rotor surface speed and viscous sealing medium provide sufficient hydrodynamic lift force to overcome bristle reaction forces. The gap generated between the bristle tips and the rotor surface determines the oil temperature rise and leakage rate. Due to shear thinning in <b>oil</b> <b>sealing</b> applications lift force is inversely correlated to oil temperature rise leading to a self-balancing effect with surface speed. The aim of a proper design for oil brush seals would be to keep the leakage at the minimum rate while avoiding excess oil temperature rise. Inherent complexity of bristles make calculation of hydrodynamic lift forces under a brush seal rather complicated. To avoid costly experimental investigations, a closed form analytical solution would prove very useful to compare candidate designs and to study what-if scenarios. This work investigates analytical solutions to hydrodynamic- lift clearance and bristle lift forces based on bearing theory. After a detailed discussion on short bearing approach, possible closed form solutions based on long bearing approach have been explored. A more comprehensive yet numerical solution based on finite beating approach has also been provided to compare and understand pressure and lifting force results. Analyses have been performed for effective constant oil viscosity. Shear thinning effect has been later introduced through use of published oil temperature data for various rotor surface speeds. As bristle tip clearance data are not available, validity of analytical {{the results have been}} evaluated using beam bending forces and experimental leakage flow data for various surface speeds. The results indicate that long bearing solution underestimates the oil lift force. Although more comprehensive, finite bearing solution requires the knowledge of axial deflection/bloom of the bristle pack. Simple yet functional, short bearing solution appears as a viable tool for seal designers to compare various seal designs before doing detail experimental evaluation on a plausible candidate. Finally, possible further work areas have been discussed...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The {{cause and}} effects of a large subsynchronous {{vibration}} (3. 5 mils at 3490 cpm) in an FCC wet gas compressor are examined. The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the balance piston and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils.

40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or recesses as part of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land grooves in an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
