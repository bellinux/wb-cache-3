5|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in New Orleans {{began with the}} {{construction}} of the Hennan Building in 1895; this building, rising , is often regarded as the first skyscraper in New Orleans.

5|$|Although {{meteorologist}} David Roth {{assessed the}} storm as making landfall on August19 at Isle Dernière {{to the west}} <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> a research paper from the American Meteorological Society estimated that the hurricane moved ashore about 40mi (60km) southeast <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> Modern research suggests the storm {{was the equivalent of}} a major hurricane (a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale), or with winds of at least , when it made landfall. It passed just southwest of the city, becoming the closest major hurricane to New Orleans. The wind diameter was average to slightly below-average, and the forward speed was normal. Due to its movement, the hurricane likely maintained much of its strength after making landfall and by the time it affected New Orleans. The hurricane gradually weakened over land, passing near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi on August20. Heavy rainfall was reported in eastern Ohio beginning on August21, potentially from the remnants of the storm merging with a cold front.|$|E
