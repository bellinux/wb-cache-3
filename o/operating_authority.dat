Between 1971 and 1973, a project to extend the high-level platforms at six stations commenced. A station rebuilding program began in 1985, and the line's R44s were overhauled, starting in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the MTA's bus {{operations}} generally follows the {{history of the}} New York City Transit Authority, also known as MTA New York City Transit (NYCT), which was created on June 15, 1953 by the State of New York to take over operations then operated by the New York City Board of Transportation. In 1962 the State established the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit <b>Operating</b> <b>Authority</b> (MaBSTOA) as a subsidiary of NYCT to take over operations then operated by two private companies, Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, Inc. and Surface Transit, Inc. Both NYCT and MaBSTOA operate service pursuant to a lease agreement with the City of New York.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1970, New York City's lease of the Tottenville {{line was}} terminated; after that date the city {{reimbursed}} the railroad for its passenger deficits. On May 29, 1970, New York City and the SIRT entered an agreement for NYC {{to purchase the}} Tottenville line. As part of the agreement, the SIRT was reserved the right to operate freight service over the line. The City was required {{to ensure that the}} trackage was in good condition for SIRT's freight operations. On June 29, 1970, the Staten Island Rapid Transit <b>Operating</b> <b>Authority</b> was incorporated as a subsidiary of the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority in order to acquire and operate the SIRT.|$|E

25|$|Public {{takeover}} of the remaining Queens buses, {{as well as most}} express routes, was implemented in 2005 and 2006 when the city purchased the assets of seven private bus companies, and entered into an agreement with the new MTA Bus Company for their operation and funding. In 2008, the bus operations of New York City Transit and MTA Bus Company (as well as the now former Long Island Bus division) were merged into a new regional operation, MTA Regional Bus Operations. The New York City Bus brand continues to be used; however, it (and the MTA Bus brand) are being phased out with the introduction of a new blue-and-gold livery; the first two buses with the new livery for New York City Transit service were delivered in fall 2016 (MTA Bus had its first 75 examples delivered in spring and summer 2016). Even with the new livery, New York City Transit Authority, Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit <b>Operating</b> <b>Authority,</b> and MTA Bus Company continue to be the legal entities operating the services.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in {{the late}} 1950s, the city {{operated}} all local service in Staten Island and Brooklyn, about half the local service in Queens, and several routes in Manhattan. Several private companies operated buses in Queens, and the Avenue B and East Broadway Transit Company operated a small Manhattan system, but {{by far the largest}} system was the Fifth Avenue Coach Company and Surface Transit, which operated almost all Manhattan routes and all Bronx routes, plus two into Queens (15 Fifth Avenue - Jackson Heights and TB Triborough Bridge) and one within Queens (16 Elmhurst Crosstown). After a strike in 1962, the city condemned the assets of the bus companies. To facilitate the anticipated sale of the bus service back to private ownership, a new agency, the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit <b>Operating</b> <b>Authority</b> (MaBSTOA) was formed as a subsidiary of the New York City Transit Authority to operate the former Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, Inc. and Surface Transit, Inc. routes under lease from the city. The final acquisition was in 1980, when MaBSTOA took over operations of the Avenue B & East Broadway Transit Co. Inc.'s routes, using MaBSTOA equipment with Avenue B red route roll signs (NYCTA acquired the 13 Grumman Flxibles that had been assigned to Avenue B and placed them in NYCTA service).|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 1940, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) {{took over}} the {{streetcar}} operations of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), {{as part of the}} unification of the city's transit system under municipal operations. The streetcar lines would be motorized into diesel bus routes or trolleybus routes over the next two decades. In 1947, the BOT {{took over the}} North Shore Bus Company in Queens and Isle Transportation in Staten Island, giving the city control of the majority of surface transit in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. On September 24, 1948, the BOT took over the East Side Omnibus Corporation and Comprehensive Omnibus Corporation in Manhattan, receiving two depots in East Harlem. From 1947 to 1950, the BOT reconstructed numerous depots and trolley barns inherited from the private operators, and erected or purchased new facilities to expand capacity. In 1962, the New York City Transit Authority (successor to the BOT) and its subsidiary Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit <b>Operating</b> <b>Authority</b> (MaBSTOA) took over the operations of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company in Manhattan and the Bronx. The Transit Authority inherited at least 12 bus depots from the company, some of which were kept in operation while others were condemned and closed. From 2005 to 2006, the remaining private operators were taken over by the MTA Bus Company. The MTA inherited eight facilities at this time, which had been built either by the companies or the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT).|$|E
