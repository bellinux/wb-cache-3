It continues parallel to the Lake Lungern shoreline until the hamlet of Kaiserstuhl <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> with a series of steep switchbacks drops down to Giswil. A 2.1 km road tunnel, opened in Oct 2004, bypasses the village, considerably reducing the through-traffic and sparing travellers the long wait at grade level crossing of the Bruenigbahn in the village center. Next, just a few hundred meters after the Giswil tunnel comes the Zollhouse tunnel, a 417-m Cut-and-cover long stretch that straightens out a narrow section of road next to the Sarnen Lake (due to open in mid-2010). A few hundred meters further comes the portal to the next bypass tunnel, that of Sachseln, which, with its just over 5 km length, is one of the longer single bore road tunnels in Switzerland. After the tunnel is Sarnen, where the road is expanded to a 4 lane divided highway. Built over a former military airstrip (along with bridge), it serves as a straight highway to Alpnach, while ahead Mount Pilatus rises. Finally, the road follows the edge of the Alpnachersee lake along the Lopper Tunnel portal. Via an elaborate series of sub-tunnels inside the mountain, this connects in both north and south directions with the A2 enabling travel north to Luzern and Germany beyond as well as south towards the Gotthard and Italy. The ability to turn off the A2 onto the A8 in the northbound direction was only added with the construction of the new Kirchenwald tunnel and a 2 km single lane connecting tunnel (which turns off the A2 inside the mountain, loops over the top of the main A2 tunnel before emerging parallel to the A8 Lopper portal.|$|E

Two special interactions {{will be addressed}} in detail: primary atomization under elevated ambient pressures and temperatures and orifce ow effects on primary atomization. The thesis will progress analogously to the physical progression of the ow from a Lagrangian reference frame, beginning with the ow in the sac volume, proceeding to the orifce <b>ow,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> moving out to the spray. As these subjects are reviewed, relevant theory in uid mechanics and thermodynamics will be presented, which will, among other things, identify and explain non-dimensional parameters frequently used in experimental studies. Even further specialized topics with much broader relevance, namely turbulence, cavitation, and other interesting phase transformations, will be covered with emphasis because these are ongoing research areas. This review focuses on past experimental work, ranging from fundamental studies using signifcantly simplifed ow rigs to studies where industrial injectors were used with little to no modifcation. Intermittently, relevant results from spray formation simulations will be included. Finally, the author will summarize his contribution {{to the state of}} knowledge in these areas. Although the detailed physics covered in this thesis have a wide range of practical applications, this thesis focuses on the orifce ow and primary atomization of sprays used in internal combustion engines (ICE) to mix liquid fuel with air. This problem has served as the main motivation for these studies because it has been identifed as a mechanism for reaction control in these engines. The detailed physics of this multiphase ow are yet to be understood fully on all relevant scales to the point where a fully exible, predictive engineering tool can be created. The author's work has addressed the controversy surrounding dense- uid mixing, together with the effect of internal ow on spray formation. Using a novel transparent injector designed by the author, the interior ow of a high-pressure marine Diesel engine fuel injector was investigated simultaneously with the spray formation region at injection pressures much closer to that of a real injector than studies in the past, and the effect of cavitation specifcally on spray formation was captured using high-speed video and Ballistic Imaging (BI). BI was also used to capture the formation region of fuel sprays from commercial injectors under a range of ambient conditions, with a variety of single-component fuels and a commercially available diesel fuel. Although a structural change in the BI was seen for butanol at the most extreme case, a more detailed study is needed to determine the uid state evolution and the effect of the ambient conditions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{performance}} evaluation {{was conducted on}} a differential mobility clas-si er that separates bers according to length using dielectrophoresis. The classi er had been constructed and used for several applications in previous studies. The per-formance of the classi er was predicted using a two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the <b>ow</b> eld <b>and</b> <b>then</b> calculating particle trajectories {{for a variety of}} conditions. Based on the ow calculations, several regions of the classi er were improved to re-duce likelihood of turbulent losses. For a given total ow through the classi er and a maximum voltage across the electrodes, the performance of the classi er was found to depend on the ratios of the aerosol ow to the inner and the outer sheath ows. It was found that the minimum classi able length, the minimum length distribution width, and the throughput of classi ed bers can each be optimized, but not independently. Several approaches to testing the resolution of the classi er were tried. The rst was to measure the length distribution of bers passing through the classi er under different conditions using electronmicroscopy. However, this was a slow and imprecise measure of performance. Two approaches using monodisperse latex spheres were used; one operated the instrument as an electrical mobility (electrophoresis) analyzer and the other evaluated only the ow system accuracy. All measures indicate that the clas-si er operates close to theoretical performance, but improvements are still possible. Suggested improvements require redesign of the <b>ow</b> system <b>and</b> improved electrode alignment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Windkessel {{and similar}} lumped models {{are often used}} to repre-sent blood <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> {{pressure}} in systemic arteries. The windkessel model was originally developed by Stephen Hales (1733) and Otto Frank (1899) who used it to describe blood ow in the heart. In this paper {{we start with the}} one-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for time-dependent blood ow in a rigid vessel to derive lumped models relating <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> pressure. This is done through Laplace transform and its inversion via residue theory. Upon keeping contributions from one, two, or more residues, we derive lumped mod-els of successively higher order. We focus on zeroth, rst and second order models and relate them to electrical circuit analogs, in which current is equiv-alent to <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> voltage to pressure. By incorporating eects of compliance through addition of capacitors, windkessel and related lumped models are ob-tained. Our results show that given the radius of a blood vessel, it is possible to determine the order of the model that would be appropriate for analyz-ing the <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> pressure in that vessel.

40|$|As {{atmospheric}} CO₂ concentrations rise, associated ocean warming (<b>OW)</b> <b>and</b> {{ocean acidification}} (OA) are predicted to cause declines in reef-building corals globally, shifting reefs from coral-dominated systems to those dominated by less sensitive species. Sponges are important structural and functional components of coral reef ecosystems, but despite increasing field-based evidence that sponges may be ‘winners’ {{in response to}} environmental degradation, {{our understanding of how}} they respond to the combined effects of <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA is limited. This PhD thesis explores the response of four abundant Great Barrier Reef species – the phototrophic Carteriospongia foliascens and Cymbastela coralliophila and the heterotrophic Stylissa flabelliformis and Rhopaloeides odorabile to <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA levels predicted for 2100, under two CO₂ Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The overall aim of this research is to bridge gaps in our understanding of how these important coral reef organisms will respond to projected climate change, to begin to explore whether a sponge dominated state is a possible future trajectory for coral reefs. To determine the tolerance of adult sponges to climate change, these four species were exposed to <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA in the Australian Institute of Marine Science’s (AIMS) National Sea Simulator (SeaSim) in a 3 -month experimental study. The first data chapter explores the physiological responses of these sponges to <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA to gain a broad understanding of sponge holobiont survival and functioning under these conditions. In this chapter I also address the hypothesis that phototrophic and heterotrophic sponges will exhibit differential responses to climate change. In the second and third data chapters I explore the cellular lipid and fatty acid composition of sponges, and how these biochemical constituents vary with <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA. Lipids and fatty acids are not only vital energy stores, they form the major components of cell membranes, and the structure and composition of these biochemical constituents ultimately determines the integrity and physiological competency of a cell. Therefore through these analyses I aimed to determine how <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA affects the metabolic balance of sponges, and to understand mechanisms underpinning observed systemic sponge responses. Finally, to provide greater insight into the population level impacts of climate change on tropical sponges, in the last data chapter I explore the response of the phototrophic species Carteriospongia foliascens to OW/OA throughout its developmental stages. I found that while sponges can generally tolerate climate change scenarios predicted under the RCP 6. 0 conditions for 2100 (30 ºC/ pH 7. 8), environmental projections for {{the end of this century}} under the RCP 8. 5 (31. 5 ºC/ pH 7. 6) will have significant implications for their survival. Temperature effects were much stronger than OA effects for all species; however, phototrophic and heterotrophic species responded differently to OA. Elevated pCO₂ exacerbated temperature stress in heterotrophic sponges but somewhat ameliorated thermal stress in phototrophic species. Furthermore, sponges with siliceous spiculated skeletons resisted the RCP 8. 5 conditions for longer than the aspiculate species. Biochemical analysis revealed that spiculated species also have greater cell membrane support features, which is likely to contribute to the observed stress tolerance. I also found that the additional energy available to phototrophic sponges under OA conditions may be used for investment into cell membrane support, providing protection against thermal stress. Finally, larval survival and settlement success of C. foliascens was unaffected by <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA treatments, and juvenile sponges exhibited greater tolerance than their adult counterparts, again with evidence that OA reduces OW stress for some of these life stages. Based on the species studied here, this thesis confirms that sponges are better able to deal with <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA levels predicted for 2100 under RCP 6. 0, compared to many corals for which survival in a high CO₂ world requires OW to remain below 1. 5 °C. This suggests sponges may be future ‘winners’ on coral reefs under global climate change. However, if CO₂ atm concentrations reach levels predicted under RCP 8. 5, the prognosis for sponge survival by the end of this century changes as inter-species sponge tolerances to <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA differ. Under this projection it is likely we will also start to see a shift in sponge populations to those dominated by phototrophic sponges with siliceous spiculated skeletons. Overall, this thesis gives a holistic view of <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> OA impacts on tropical sponges and provides the basis from which to explore the potential for a sponge-coral regime shift in a high CO₂ world...|$|R

The model performs well in pricing average returns on single- and double-sorted portfolios ac- cording to size, book-to-market, dividend-price ratios and past risk, by producing high estimates for the explained cross-sectional variation in average returns and economically and statistically acceptable estimates for the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion.

IntroductionThis study sought to validate new approaches to rapid, very early screening and selection of radiata pine families, using microfibril angle (MFA) as a reference for comparative purposes. MethodA key feature was tilting the trees at an angle of ∼ 30 ° after the initial 12  months of growth in order to force production of opposite wood (<b>OW)</b> <b>and</b> compression wood (CW) and prevent the co-mingling of the two distinctive wood types as occurs ‘at random’ within vertical stems. After 34  months, <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> CW materials were characterised independently for acoustic velocity (V), dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEdynamic), basic density and longitudinal shrinkage. Finally, MFA were determined with X-ray diffraction. ResultNo phenotypic correlation was observed between <b>OW</b> <b>and</b> CW wood properties. The Spearman ranking correlation between V 2 and MFA values in OW was 0. 81. ConclusionWe show that families or individual trees with superior wood properties can be screened at this young age using acoustics. Further, the same outcomes can be achieved as with X-ray diffraction (MFA) but more cheaply and rapidly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} Zhu's {{model for}} combustion in a Hele-Shaw cell which re-duces to a nonlocal curvature evolution {{problem for a}} curve in the plane. The normal velocity {{is the sum of}} the curvature dependent burning rate and the uid eects from the potential <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> gravity. We give the physical and geometric motivations and relate our study to various similar problems that have been considered. Due to the assumption of equal viscosities and zero surface tension, our model admits a rela-tively simple treatment. We give ngering criteria, geometric properties and stability results for the <b>ow</b> <b>and</b> its linearization about the rising circle solution. In this section, we describe certain nonlocal geometric evolution problems cur-rently of great interest in applied mathematics. The equations reduce to a curvature evolution problem for curves in the plane with nonlocal term. We shall describe two types of nonlocal problems that occur in potential <b>ows</b> <b>and</b> mention a few results in order to give context to our recent work about the stability of a combustion problem. Then we shall describe our model and some results. Details will appear elsewhere[Tr]...|$|R
