5|$|The Shia {{majority}} {{ruled by}} the Sunni Al khalifa family since the eighteenth century have long complained <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> systemic discrimination. They are blocked from serving in important political and military posts {{and the government has}} reportedly naturalized Sunnis originally from Pakistan and Syria in what Shia say is an attempt to increase the percentage of Sunnis in the population.|$|E
25|$|There are Protestants, {{especially}} of the Reformed tradition, that either reject or down-play the designation Protestant because of the negative idea that the word invokes {{in addition to its}} primary meaning, preferring the designation Reformed, Evangelical or even Reformed Catholic expressive <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> a Reformed Catholicity and defending their arguments from the traditional Protestant confessions.|$|E
500|$|During the Paley and Austin partnership, the {{architectural}} styles {{used by the}} practice changed and developed. [...] In church architecture, Paley had already started to introduce Perpendicular features {{in some of his}} designs, and this trend was to continue and increase after the arrival of Austin. [...] Throughout their partnership, the designs for churches were mainly in Gothic Revival style. [...] After the arrival of Austin, there was much greater use of Perpendicular features. Brandwood et al. see the practice as national pioneers in this trend, saying [...] "the firm {{can be seen as a}} true pioneer in the rehabilitation of Perpendicular architecture after its ecclesiological exile for a quarter of a century". [...] Early examples of what the authors consider to be part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> [...] "the Perpendicular revival in the North" [...] are the rebuilding of the bodies of StMary, Leigh, (1871–73) and All Saints, Daresbury (1870–72). [...] The Perpendicular [...] "would become the stock-in-trade style for some of the most admired buildings as the years rolled on". However they did continue to use features from the Early English and Decorated styles, sometimes together in the same church, as in New StLeonard, Langho. [...] Away from the Gothic Revival style, Norman or Norman transitional features were occasionally used, as in [...] StMary, Betws-y-Coed (1872–73), and StPeter, Finsthwaite (1873–74).|$|E

500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will find a lot <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit {{the spirit of the}} story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

Harris's father stated that his son was [...] "a member <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> the Trenchcoat Mafia" [...] in a 911 call he made on April 20, 1999. Klebold attended the high school prom three days before the shootings with a classmate named Robyn Anderson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} human rights in Bahrain was criticized in the period between 1975 and 2001. The {{government}} had committed wide range violations including systematic torture. Following reforms in 2001, human rights improved significantly and were praised by Amnesty International. They allegedly began deteriorating again at the end of 2007 when torture and repression tactics were being used again. By 2010, torture had become common and Bahrain's human rights record was described as [...] "dismal" [...] by Human Rights Watch. The Shia majority have long complained <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> systemic discrimination. They accuse the government of naturalizing Sunnis from neighbouring countries and gerrymandering electoral districts.|$|E

2500|$|Sokal and Bricmont {{highlight}} {{the rising tide}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>call</b> cognitive relativism, the belief {{that there are no}} objective truths but only local beliefs. They argue that this view is held by a number of people, including people who the authors label [...] "postmodernists" [...] and the Strong Programme in the sociology of science, and that it is illogical, impractical, and dangerous. Their aim is [...] "not to criticize the left, but to help defend it from a trendy segment of itself." [...] Quoting Michael Albert, [...] "there is nothing truthful, wise, humane, or strategic about confusing hostility to injustice and oppression, which is leftist, with hostility to science and rationality, which is nonsense." ...|$|E

The Mentat assassin Thufir Hawat is later shocked to learn that Fremen have not only overcome some of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV's fierce and previously unstoppable Sardaukar soldiers, but have done the impossible and captured some as well. Herbert also writes that [...] "Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen — that their children fought as ferociously as the adults." [...] In the novel Shaddam notes, [...] "I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men." ...|$|E
