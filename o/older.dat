5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than <b>older</b> males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and <b>older</b> male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in <b>older</b> males. Moreover, <b>older</b> males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of <b>older</b> males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
