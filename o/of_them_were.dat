Forty percent <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> from Japan, {{the most}} heavily represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> raised {{in the province of}} Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and at the latest by 1125.|$|E

Only six people were unemployed, which matches the national average of 4.30%, and 22 people (15.9%) were retired, slightly higher than the national average of 13.4%. In addition, the parish contains 92 households with an average size of 2.2 people.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|All {{three of}} the ships in Toulon were placed in reserve and two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> {{captured}} virtually intact when the Germans attempted to seize the French fleet in November 1942.

The Italians scuttled one, but the other escaped to join the Free French and spent the remainder of the war as a convoy escort in the Mediterranean or protecting Allied forces in the Ligurian Sea.|$|E

5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because {{of the destruction of}} the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
