5|$|All told, sixteen people {{pleaded guilty}} for crimes {{committed}} at the company, and five others, including four former Merrill Lynch employees, were found guilty. Eight former Enron executives testified—the main witness being Fastow—against Lay and Skilling, his former bosses. Another was Kenneth Rice, {{the former chief}} <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Corp.'s high-speed Internet unit, who cooperated and whose testimony helped convict Skilling and Lay. In June 2007, he received a 27-month sentence.|$|E
5|$|He co-authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>Enron,</b> he co-sponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan {{to minimize the}} risk of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> to help improve the stock price.|$|E

We're the criminals. And don't think it's just this company. There's hundreds <b>of</b> <b>Enrons</b> out there, a thousand, cooking the books, inflating the earnings, hiding the debt, buying off the watchdogs.|$|R
50|$|Pai joined Enron in 1987, when it {{was still}} just a {{regional}} energy supplier. He became one of (eventual) CEO Jeffrey Skilling’s top lieutenants, primarily tasked with detailing and implementing Skilling’s vision <b>of</b> transforming <b>Enron</b> into a de facto energy-commodities-trading firm. During his Enron career, Skilling put Pai in charge <b>of</b> multiple <b>Enron</b> subsidiaries; Pai was CEO <b>of</b> the EES (<b>Enron</b> Energy Services) subsidiary from March 1997, until May 2001. The reasons for his resignation from Enron remain shrouded in mystery.|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged {{the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets {{made it possible for}} traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> and others prevented such regulation.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies {{were said to be}} anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> and Dynegy.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit <b>of</b> <b>Enron.</b> Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin {{and took}} his first job in the {{political}} arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House staffer, among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse <b>of</b> <b>Enron,</b> and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the Kerry campaign.|$|E
5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

25|$|Skilling {{started his}} career in Houston as an analyst for First City Bancorporation of Texas in Houston. First City was one of Enron's banks and just before it failed the first time, Skilling quit. The CEO of Collecting Bank, the FDIC's {{facility}} for managing the bad assets of First City, was Sam Segnar, the first CEO and chairman <b>of</b> <b>Enron.</b> The new First City Bank, headed by A. Robert Abboud, was also an Enron bank. Abboud was {{the former president of}} First Chicago Bank and Occidental Petroleum under Armand Hammer. First City was initiated by Judge James Andersen Elkins and his law partnership, Vinson & Elkins, one of Enron's main law companies. As a consultant for McKinsey & Company, Skilling worked with Enron during 1987, helping the company create a forward market in natural gas. Skilling impressed Kenneth Lay in his capacity as a consultant, and was hired by Lay during 1990 as {{chairman and chief executive officer}} <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Finance Corp. In 1991, he became the chairman <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Gas Services Co., which was a result of the merger <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Gas Marketing and Enron Finance Corp. Skilling was named CEO and managing director <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Capital & Trade Resources, which was the subsidiary responsible for energy trading and marketing. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> during 1997, second only to Lay, while remaining the manager <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Capital & Trade Resources. During 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Eichenwald’s {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> led to {{his third}} and most successful book, Conspiracy of Fools (2005).

The book was optioned as a movie by Warner Brothers, to potentially star Leonardo DiCaprio. However, the film was never made.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008, {{the bank}} {{announced}} plans to construct a new European headquarters at Canary Wharf, London.

25|$|After {{years at}} the {{outdated}} Astrodome, the Astros moved into their new stadium in 2000.

Additionally the ballpark featured more intimate surroundings than the cavernous Astrodome. It is believed by some that the departure of the NFL's Houston Oilers, after Houston refused to build them a new stadium, contributed to the construction <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> Field.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, bank {{interest}} rates in Japan were near zero {{for an extended period}} of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>Enron,</b> in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low.|$|E

25|$|As the {{influence}} and profitability of CRAs expanded, so did scrutiny and concern about their performance and alleged illegal practices. In 1996 the US Department of Justice launched {{an investigation into}} possible improper pressuring of issuers by Moody's {{in order to win}} business. Agencies were subjected to dozens of lawsuits by investors complaining of inaccurate ratings following the collapse <b>of</b> <b>Enron,</b> and especially after the US subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent late-2000s financial crisis. During that debacle, 73%—over $800 billion worth—of all mortgage-backed securities that one credit rating agency (Moody's) had rated triple-A in 2006 were downgraded to junk status two years later.|$|E
25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case <b>of</b> <b>Enron</b> in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|By 2000, {{demand for}} Downtown office space increased, and {{construction}} of office buildings resumed. The cutbacks by firms such as Dynegy, {{in addition to the}} fall <b>of</b> <b>Enron,</b> caused the occupancy rate of Downtown Houston buildings to decrease to 84.1% in 2003 from 97.3% less than two years previously. In 2003, the types of firms with operations in Downtown Houston typically were accounting firms, energy firms, and law firms. Typically newer buildings had higher occupancy rates than older buildings. In 2004, the real estate firm Cresa Partners stated that the vacancy rate in Downtown Houston's Class A office space was almost 20%. The Texas Legislature established the Downtown Houston Management District in 1995.|$|E
