5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{problems}} for Colt were the provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> Act of 1808 which stated that any arms purchased by a State militia {{had to be}} in current service in the United States Military. This Act prevented state militias from allocating funds towards the purchase of experimental weapons or foreign weapons.|$|E
5|$|During the war, another {{battalion}} with {{a similar}} designation, the 2/10th Battalion, was raised {{as part of the}} all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Although many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> volunteered to join the 2nd AIF, the units of the 2nd AIF were considered separate from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> and many existed at the same time. Recruited from South Australians, the 2/10th was raised in mid-October 1939 and formed part of the 18th Brigade that was initially assigned to the 6th Division before being transferred to the 7th. Over {{the course of the war}} it served in the United Kingdom, North Africa, New Guinea and Borneo before being disbanded in December 1945.|$|E
50|$|Efner was a {{major in}} <b>the</b> New York <b>Militia</b> during <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1812. He was later {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and second in command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia's</b> 104th Regiment.|$|R
50|$|After {{witnessing}} numerous {{problems with}} <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> during <b>the</b> Spanish-American War, President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War, Elihu Root, {{pushed for a}} reformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>Militia</b> System into a dedicated National Guard Bureau within the United States Department <b>of</b> War. <b>The</b> resulting <b>Militia</b> Act <b>of</b> 1903 (also known as the Dick Act due to it sponsorship by Senator Charles Dick from Ohio), classified all American males between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 17 and 45 as either part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organized <b>militia</b> (<b>the</b> National Guard), or a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unorganized <b>militia</b> (all males within the age range who are not members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Guard).|$|R
25|$|Longkodo was <b>the</b> {{commander}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> {{stationed at}} <b>the</b> capital at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yongzheng Emperor's succession. He fell in disgrace in 1728 and died while under house arrest.|$|R
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, was quick to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia.</b> Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E
5|$|The Special Reserve {{was to be}} {{organised}} by regulations issued {{under the}} Reserve Forces Act 1882, forming regiments and battalions either of existing regular corps or of newly created ones. The Crown was given the power to transfer, by Order in Council, existing battalions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> to the Special Reserve, which were to be deemed lawfully formed battalions of special reservists as of that date. An Order in Council was accordingly made under this section on 9 April 1908, which transferred all units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia,</b> other than those which disbanded, into the Special Reserve.|$|E
5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was in command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
50|$|Although not a {{continuation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>militia,</b> <b>the</b> titling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Bermudian artillery reserve as <b>the</b> Bermuda <b>Militia</b> Artillery, {{rather than as}} the Bermuda Volunteer Artillery, followed the practice then current in Britain for similar units, which, though voluntary, were {{a continuation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>militia.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1808 until 1810, he was Lt. Col. Commanding 1st Reg. 2nd Brig. <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio <b>Militia.</b> During <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1812, {{he served}} as Adjutant General <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio <b>Militia</b> from 1810 until 1819.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1812, Fillmore was {{appointed}} a {{captain in the}} 13th Infantry Regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York <b>Militia,</b> and took part in several battles in upstate New York and Canada. {{he was promoted to}} major, and then lieutenant colonel, and commanded the regiment before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. he later served as lieutenant colonel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia's</b> 17th Regiment.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the main}} focus of Australia's {{military}} during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East, there was still a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks. As the AIF was otherwise engaged these duties out of necessity fell to the soldiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> and a small number of regular soldiers.|$|E
5|$|County {{officials}} did not {{take care of the}} problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia,</b> suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia.</b> Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} <b>of</b> Francisco Largo Caballero and <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist {{party to}} {{dominance in the}} armed forces, <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> was accelerated and most units were coerced into joining the regular army.|$|R
50|$|Deploying the Ituri brigade {{conducting}} cordon {{and search}} operations improved the security conditions in Ituri, {{but at the}} same time the peacekeepers became <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias.</b> On 12 February 2004, a military observer was killed in Ituri.|$|R
50|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{collapse}} <b>of</b> some segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi Army {{under the}} Daesh offensive, <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> fighting <b>the</b> Islamic State is largely {{supported by the}} Shia majority in the country, and many among the Sunni minority.|$|R
5|$|During the engagement, 12 militiamen {{were killed}} by Band warriors while making a stand on a small hill. The {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle. A 2006 article corroborates that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln {{was present at the}} battleground's burials; sources agree about little else. Investigation continues in the early 21st century about facts of the skirmish.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double the strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and {{late in the year}} a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, the Wisconsin Territory {{was formed}} {{from the western}} section of the Michigan Territory. Chapman became the first U.S. Attorney for this new {{territory}} when it was created. He was elected as colonel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> in 1836 after moving {{to what is now}} Dubuque, Iowa. Then in 1838, the Iowa Territory was carved from the Wisconsin Territory.|$|E
50|$|Djotodia {{announced}} <b>the</b> dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Séléka in September 2013, {{but most}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> refused to disband. The Séléka and the anti-balaka {{engaged in a}} cycle of increasing violence, including reprisal attacks on individuals believed to be civilians by many.|$|R

5|$|Preparations {{for the war}} {{dominated}} Shelby's second term. Two {{days before}} his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky <b>militia.</b> This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> <b>of</b> Indiana and Illinois, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying to <b>the</b> defense <b>of</b> Fort Wayne.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} ending, Nix and Zeke turn against Cole and steal the RFI. Together with Kuo and the Beast, Cole rampages through New Marais, killing Laroche and what remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia.</b> He {{eventually}} {{catches up with}} his former friends, killing them and destroying the RFI. The Beast, weary from overusing his power, dies shortly after tasking Cole and Kuo with finishing his plan. Fully embracing his role {{as leader of the}} Conduits, Cole prepares to build a new world for them.|$|E
5|$|In total, Montcalm had 13,390 regular troops, Troupes de la Marine, and militia {{available}} in Quebec City {{and along the}} Beauport shore, as well as 200 cavalry, 200 artillery (including the guns of Quebec), 300 native warriors (including many Odawa under Charles de Langlade), and 140 Acadian volunteers, {{but most of these}} troops did not participate in the action. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous irregulars were more used to guerilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all regulars.|$|E
5|$|The 31st/51st Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army, which served during World War II. Raised for service as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> in 1943 through the amalgamation of two previously existing battalions, the 31st/51st Battalion undertook garrison duties in Dutch New Guinea in 1943–44 before {{taking part in}} the Bougainville Campaign in 1944–45. Following the end of the war, the battalion served in the Pacific overseeing the transfer of Japanese prisoners of war and re-establishing law and order until mid-1946 when it returned to Australia and was disbanded.|$|E
25|$|After the war Trigg {{continued}} his service in <b>the</b> Virginia <b>militia.</b> He {{was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in 1791, and in 1793 served as a major in <b>the</b> Second Battalion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tenth Regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia <b>militia.</b> In 1796 and 1802, he was commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 91st Regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia <b>militia.</b>|$|R

5|$|The battle site at Kellogg's Grove {{was listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1978. The listing {{included}} a 1½ acre public park where a stone monument and memorial cemetery is located. The cemetery holds the interred remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> who died during both battles at Kellogg's Grove. The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers banded together to collect {{the remains of the}} Black Hawk War dead and inter them in one spot beneath a memorial.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the 45th Brigade Combat Team {{can be traced back}} to 1890 with the {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> of the Territory of Oklahoma. That militia was mobilized in 1898 during the Spanish–American War but never deployed. In 1916 the First Oklahoma Infantry Regiment deployed for border security duty during the Mexican Border Conflict. In 1917, the First Oklahoma Infantry Regiment, reassigned as part of the 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th Division fought in the final month of World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} 5th and 6th {{stayed at}} the depot {{throughout}} the night and into the next morning. If any individual needed to leave, they did so in civilian clothes and unarmed, for fear of the crowd should they be discovered {{to be a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militia.</b> Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E
50|$|During February 1948 <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> {{obtained}} 10,000 {{rifles and}} 2,000 submachine guns from the armament factory Zbrojovka Brno. The equipment was continually modernized with sniper rifles, machine guns, mortars, anti-aircraft {{machine guns and}} transport vehicles. The ammunition was kept in army stores. During the 1970s recoilless guns and RPG-7 were added among the armament. After dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>militias</b> their equipment was {{handed over to the}} army.|$|R
