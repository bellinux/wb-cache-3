5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he {{repeatedly}} urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Resisting temptations {{to resort}} to small-arms warfare {{in the face of}} the vast {{military}} resources of the Israeli armed forces, Palestinians took to throwing stones, an improvised weapon which had deep symbolic resonances <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural,</b> historical and religious kind.

25|$|The term “retro” or “retro-aesthetic” {{became popular}} in the mass culture of the nineties, rather than through any art connection. As a {{movement}} that has penetrated film, fashion, music and custom design to a similar extent, retro has become a specific expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> orientation - {{the spirit of the}} times in {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|From 2002 onward, {{the rest}} of Asbury Park {{has been in the}} midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural,</b> political, and {{economic}} revival, including a burgeoning industry of local and national artists.

In 2005, the Casino's walkway reopened, as did many of the boardwalk pavilions.|$|E
25|$|In the East, Alexander the Great's conquests {{initiated}} {{several centuries}} of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, which was greatly {{aided by the}} spread of Buddhism, which early on picked up many Greek traits and motifs in Greco-Buddhist art, which were then transmitted as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> package to East Asia, even as far as Japan, among artists who were no doubt completely unaware {{of the origin of}} the motifs and styles they used.|$|E

25|$|Control of or {{at least}} {{inclusion}} in the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> epic is important because the traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid is, at its core, a written history. Written history defines {{the good and the}} bad of a culture, the winners and losers, and the author of that history controls the very future by manipulating the knowledge of later generations. For Friedman to deny epic associations to the long poem because they are sometimes written by women is to counter the efforts of many female long poets.|$|E
25|$|During the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the commercial, {{intellectual}} and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its industrial decline following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent financial services sector and the proceeds of North Sea oil and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on Scottish independence, and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years after the {{struggle}} for independence, Pramoedya wrote several works of fiction dealing {{with the problems of}} the newly founded nation, as well as semi-autobiographical works based on his wartime memoirs. He was soon able to live in the Netherlands as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> exchange program. In the years that followed, he took an interest in several other cultural exchanges, including trips to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as translations of Russian writers Maxim Gorky and Leo Tolstoy.|$|E

25|$|Tifinagh (or rather, Neo-Tifinagh) was {{introduced}} in the late 1990s and its use is now supported by the Moroccan authorities, in a standardised form promulgated by the Institut Royal de la Culture Amazighe (IRCAM, Rabat). Publications entirely printed in Tifinagh still remain rare, and only a tiny proportion of Shilha speakers, if any, are able to handle the new script with confidence. Its main role is emblematic, that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> icon. As such, Tifinagh has entered the public space, with town signs now showing the name in Tifinagh as well as in Arabic and Latin script.|$|E
25|$|Returning to India in 1939, he edited with Iqbal Singh, Changing India, an {{anthology}} of modern Indian thought from Ram Mohan Roy to Jawaharlal Nehru. He participated in the Quit India Movement of 1942. In 1943–1944 he co-edited with Ahmad Ali a journal from Bombay called Tomorrow. He was the prime mover in the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> organisation, Sri Vidya Samiti, devoted to reviving the values of ancient Indian civilisation; this organisation failed shortly after inception. In Bombay, he was also associated with Chetana, a cultural society for the propagation of Indian thought and values.|$|E
25|$|Though Britpop {{is viewed}} as a {{marketing}} tool, and more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade.|$|E
