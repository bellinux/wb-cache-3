25|$|The 1924 ban on {{immigration}} produced unusually well-defined generational {{groups within the}} Japanese-American community. The issei were exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924; some desired {{to return to their}} homeland. Because no new immigration was permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were, by definition, born in the U.S. and automatically U.S. citizens. This nisei generation were a distinct cohort from their parents. In addition to the usual generational differences, issei men had been typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives, making them significantly older than the younger children of their often large families. U.S. law prohibited Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens, making them dependent <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to rent or purchase property. Communication between English-speaking children and parents who spoke mostly or completely in Japanese was often difficult. A significant number of older nisei, many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban, had married and already started families of their own by the time the US joined World War II.|$|E

[...] The Banat-Swabian community, of which the narrator is a member, was described by Müller as extremely ethnocentric. Following persecution after the war, while remaining survivors had no desire to emigrate to Germany, they exerted an almost totalitarian control, especially <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to keep them within their community. Müller had already addressed this topic in her first work, Niederungen, translated as Nadirs in English, in which the German community holds on to its language and habits in an attempt to deny the Romanian dictatorship that rules them.

At the age of around seven he joined the Boys' Brigade, and quickly showed his natural talent for football, scoring ten goals in a game against boys almost twice his age.

2500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{awarded the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, stating that {{director}} Gary Ross [...] "gets the tone of The Hunger Games right.

[...] The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style, but it was said to [...] "add to the film in certain ways". The violence drew commentary as well. Time critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children, even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel, while critic Théoden Janes of the Charlotte Observer found that [...] " [...] the violence is so bland it dilutes the message". Also writing in Time, psychologist Christopher J. Ferguson argued that parents' fears of the effect of the film's violent content <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were unnecessary, and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed.|$|E

[...] The couple had eleven children, two of whom died in infancy. (They had been christened Kate and Ellen after their paternal and maternal grandmothers; Benjamin and Sarah reused the names for their next two daughters.) Of the nine children who survived to adulthood only two, the eldest son, Benjamin, and the next to youngest, Tom, had no theatrical history.
