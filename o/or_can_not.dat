Thus, if the Chinese room does not <b>or</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are [...] "no refutation (but rather an affirmation)" [...] of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that no digital computers can have a mind.|$|E

Of course, we know that vessels have been several times taken by the Spaniards, while at anchor close to the towns; but they might risk that, if there were no danger from the Moors, themselves. But if the reports last sent by Mr. Logie are confirmed, the Moors would be openly at war with us; and would, themselves, seize and make prizes of vessels anchoring. The danger would, of course, be vastly greater than that of merely running the risk of capture, if a Spanish vessel of war happened to come into a port where they were at anchor. Of course, I am merely expressing the views of the governor." ...|$|E

6000|$|England {{may have}} seven {{different}} grades of productiveness in her [...] iron and coal supplies, of which her grades 1, 2, and 3 are [...] {{superior to the}} best grade of the United States, while grades 1, [...] 2, 3, and 4 in the United States may compare only with grades 4, [...] 5, 6, 7 of England. So long as England can supply herself and the [...] United States also with coal and iron from the three superior [...] grades, the United States can not work grade 1 at home. But if the [...] supply for England and the world requires grade 5 to be worked, [...] then the United States can begin the industry on her best grade, [...] although that is far inferior to the best grade in England. [...] Likewise, if the United States has three grades of wheat-land [...] superior to England’s best grade, the ability of England to grow [...] wheat depends on whether the United States can, <b>or</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> supply [...] both herself and England from grades 1, 2, and 3. If we must [...] resort to grade 4, then England can begin to grow wheat as well as [...] we. In short, under a system of free exchange, as great a [...] diversity as under protection is probably possible, but only in [...] {{such a way that}} the best possible advantages in each particular [...] industry are employed. Smaller amounts in some branches, and [...] greater amounts in others, may be produced under a free than under [...] a restrictive system, but with all the greater gain which arises [...] from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade. The most poorly [...] endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up, but not [...] the whole industry itself. No class of persons feel the [...] competition of rivals more than English farmers since American [...] wheat has come into English markets, and yet it does not follow [...] that England can not grow a bushel of wheat. The fact is, merely, [...] that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation, and a [...] readjustment made, to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food. [...] So with us: we should not, by the free exchange, be forced to give [...] up the iron and coal industries entirely; for the best mines would [...] still keep that occupation in existence to “diversify” the others.|$|E
60|$|Now rude as is this {{sketch of}} a process that would be {{extremely}} elaborate and involved, and open as some of its propositions are to criticisms {{which there is no}} space here to meet; no one will deny that it represents something like the biologic history of the supposed new continent. Details apart, it is manifest that simple organisms, able to flourish under simple conditions of life, would be the first successful immigrants; and that more complex organisms, needing for their existence the fulfilment of more complex conditions, would afterwards establish themselves in something like an ascending succession. At the one extreme we see every facility. The new individuals can be conveyed in the shape of minute germs; immense numbers of these are perpetually being carried in all directions to great distances by ocean-currents--either detached or attached to floating bodies; they can find nutriment wherever they arrive; and the resulting organisms can multiply asexually with great rapidity. At the other extreme, we see every difficulty. The new individuals must be conveyed in their adult forms; their numbers are, in comparison, utterly insignificant; they live on land, and are very unlikely to be carried out to sea; when so carried, the chances are immense against their escape from drowning, starvation, or death by cold; if they survive the transit, they must have a pre-existing Flora or Fauna to supply their special food; they require, also, the fulfilment of various other physical conditions; and unless at least two individuals of different sexes are safely landed, the race cannot be established. Manifestly, then, the immigration of each successively higher order of organisms, having, from one or other additional condition to be fulfilled, an enormously-increased probability against it, would naturally be separated from the immigration of a lower order by some period like a geologic epoch. And thus the successive sedimentary deposits formed while this new continent was undergoing gradual elevation, would seem to furnish clear evidence of a general progress in the forms of life. That lands thus raised up {{in the midst of a}} wide ocean, would first give origin to unfossiliferous strata; next, to strata containing only the lowest marine forms; next to strata containing only the higher marine forms, ascending finally to fish; and that the strata above these would contain reptiles, then small mammals, then great mammals; seems to us demonstrable. And if the succession of fossils presented by the strata of this supposed new continent, would thus simulate the succession presented by our own sedimentary series; must we not conclude that our own sedimentary series very possibly records nothing more than the phenomena accompanying one of these great upheavals? The probability of this conclusion being admitted, it must be admitted that the facts of Paleontology can never suffice either to prove or disprove the Development Hypothesis; but that the most they can do is to show whether the last few pages of the Earth's biologic history, are or are not in harmony with this hypothesis--whether the existing Flora and Fauna can <b>or</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be affiliated upon the Flora and Fauna of the most recent geologic times.|$|E
