5|$|The gradual {{implementation}} of various legislation {{over the following}} decade allowed many counties to vastly improve roads under their jurisdiction. By the time the Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway3 in Tillsonburg to Highway2 in Ingersoll on March12, 1930 as King's Highway19, it was <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> gravel road.|$|E
5|$|After easy wins in both conference {{regular season}} and conference tournament, UConn entered the NCAA tournament unbeaten, #1 overall and <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> heavy {{favorite}} to win it all; the season came to an unexpected end when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater to give its team a 66-64 overtime victory in the NCAA Final Four. The loss ended the streak at 111 consecutive wins, an all time record not only for college basketball games, but also for any team sport played at college level.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 the British {{government}} decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in Benbecula, where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited <b>once</b> <b>again.</b> <b>A</b> variety of military buildings and masts {{have since been}} erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.|$|E

5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north <b>once</b> <b>again.</b> <b>A</b> tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|Between 1987 and 1998, the {{development}} corporation attracted 1,000companies, generating 28,299new jobs and £1.759billion of private sector investment. The setting {{up of the}} corporation {{was intended to be}} only a temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E

5|$|In 1513 James IV {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} England, attempting {{to take advantage of}} the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, Mary I. <b>Once</b> <b>again,</b> <b>a</b> regency was established.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian spell {{ended with}} San Lorenzo's first title, beating Nacional of Paraguay in the finals. But another trend was born, as <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> new {{champion}} was crowned, {{for the third}} consecutive year. San Lorenzo's victory was then followed by another Argentine club's victory, River Plate, winning its third title on 2015. But Atletico Nacional stopped this new trend, by beating Ecuador's Independiente del Valle on a 2-1 aggregate. The Colombian team won their second title after 27 years and one former failure attempt in 1995 against Grêmio, becoming the first pacific team to reach that achievement {{in the history of the}} tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson {{administration}} had merged the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1966 into the Commonwealth Office, which, two years later, was {{merged with the}} Foreign Office, to form the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned <b>once</b> <b>again.</b> <b>A</b> sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E
5|$|The {{team won}} a prize for each {{obstacle}} completed, escalating in value up {{to a grand}} prize for completing the entire course. Two-person teams split the cash earnings, and both contestants received the same prize for each obstacle. Prizes included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox Family Double Dare, cash. On the original and Super Sloppy versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at Space Camp. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000. On the Fox Family Double Dare, {{as well as the}} first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000.

5|$|The war was {{the first}} {{prolonged}} conflict in Britain to involve the use of artillery and gunpowder. Sieges became a prominent {{part of the war}} with over 300 occurring during the period. Worcester was <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> strategically important region in the war, and walled towns and cities like Worcester that could be defended against passing armies were particularly significant from a military perspective. By the 1640s the design of military fortifications had progressed significantly on the continent, owing largely to the Thirty Years War; while older medieval stone walls still had military utility, they typically needed reinforcement with more modern earthworks to be truly effective. These new ideas were applied to city defences in England. In some cases a circuit of forts was built around a city; in other cases, an entirely new city wall comprising modern bastions would be built. At Worcester, the unimproved walls were considered to be indefensible {{at the start of the}} war in 1642, and the chosen solution was to directly reinforce the existing medieval wall with new earthworks.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{were seen}} to have their best chance in {{reaching}} a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However a Gheorghe Hagi-inspired Romania defeated Wales 5–1 in Bucharest to open the Wales campaign. Victories over the Faroe Islands and Belgium and two draws with the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks put Wales back on track, and a victory over Romania in Cardiff in the last game of the tournament {{would be enough to}} secure a place in the World Cup. However Southall allowed a 25-yard strike from Hagi slip under his body and into the net and was nutmegged by Florin Răducioiu as Wales were beaten 2–1. <b>Once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> death put Welsh footballing hopes into perspective, as Southall attended the funeral of retired postman John Hill, who was killed after being struck by a flare released {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1995–96 season, {{shortly after}} Watford's relegation from the First Division, Hessenthaler signed for Gillingham for £235,000, a record fee at the time for the club. He quickly became a key player at Priestfield Stadium. In the 1998–99 season, he {{returned}} to his best form, and he played in the Gills' first ever match at Wembley Stadium. This match was the final of the play-offs against Manchester City, which Gillingham lost after a penalty shoot-out. Shortly afterwards, Gillingham manager Tony Pulis, who had signed Hessenthaler, was dismissed from his post. He was replaced by Peter Taylor, who appointed Hessenthaler as player-coach. In his first season in this new role, he was <b>once</b> <b>again</b> <b>a</b> regular in the Gillingham team, making a total of 47 appearances as the club recorded its highest position to date in the English football league system and best ever run in the FA Cup. Although the cup run came to an end with a 5–0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea of the Premier League, Hessenthaler's high-energy performance prompted Chelsea chairman Ken Bates to joke that he had been keen to sign the player until he discovered to his surprise that he was 35 years old (although Hessenthaler was in fact only 34 at the time). Gillingham once again qualified for the play-off final, with Hessenthaler making his second appearance at Wembley as the Gills beat Wigan Athletic 3–2 after extra time to secure promotion to the Football League First Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history.|$|E
