40|$|Abstract: Radiolarian skeletons {{are known}} from a {{limestone}} concretion collected {{from a black}} shale succession and from black cherts of the Yangtze Platform, China. Both occurrences are of earliest Cambrian age. The findings, reported in this paper, represent the oldest known fossil Radiolaria. Their spherical skeletons display a morphology typical of spherical radiolarians from Ordovician and younger faunas. This occurrence of radiolarians with radial symmetry and, most probably, a planktonic lifestyle can now be traced back into the earliest Cambrian. Thus, radiolarians {{have been part of}} the early <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> and likely played a significant role in the silica cycle of the oceans along with siliceous sponges. Apart from their natural beauty, radiolarians are an important constituent of today’s <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> and one of the major groups of organisms utilizing opaline silica to form their skeletons (Anderson 1983). They significantly influence the oceanic silica cycle, and their skeletons contributed to oceanic sediments and siliceous sedimentary rock...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of Saharan dust on the abundance, biomass, community structure, and metabolic activity of <b>oceanic</b> microbial <b>plankton,</b> we conducted eight bioassay experiments between ca. 30 °N and 30 °S in the central Atlantic Ocean. We found that, although bulk abundance and biomass tended to remain unchanged, different groups of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton responded differently to Saharan dust addition. The predominant type of metabolic response depended on the ecosystem s degree of oligotrophy and was modulated by competition for nutrients between phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria. The relative increase in bacterial production, which was the dominant response to dust addition in ultraoligotrophic environments, became larger with increasing oligotrophy. In contrast, primary production, which was stimulated only in the least oligotrophic waters, became less responsive to dust as the ecosystem s degree of oligotrophy increased. Given the divergent consequences of a predominantly bacterial vs. phytoplanktonic response, dust inputs can, depending on the ecosystem's degree of oligotrophy, stimulate or weaken biological CO 2 drawdown. Thus, the biogeochemical implications of changing dust fluxes might not be universal, but variable through both space and time. Versión del edito...|$|R
40|$|Current {{carbon dioxide}} {{emissions}} are an assumed threat to <b>oceanic</b> calcifying <b>plankton</b> (coccolithophores) not just due to rising sea-surface temperatures, {{but also because of}} ocean acidification (OA). This assessment is based on single species culture experiments that are now revealing complex, synergistic, and adaptive responses to such environmental change. Despite this complexity, there is still a widespread perception that coccolithophore calcification will be inhibited by OA. These plankton have an excellent fossil record, and so we can test for the impact of OA during geological carbon cycle events, providing the added advantages of exploring entire communities across real-world major climate perturbation and recovery. Here we target fossil coccolithophore groups (holococcoliths and braarudosphaerids) expected to exhibit greatest sensitivity to acidification because of their reliance on extracellular calcification. Across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma) rapid warming event, the biogeography and abundance of these extracellular calcifiers shifted dramatically, disappearing entirely from low latitudes to become limited to cooler, lower saturation-state areas. By comparing these range shift data with the environmental parameters from an Earth system model, we show that the principal control on these range retractions was temperature, with survival maintained in high-latitude refugia, despite more adverse ocean chemistry conditions. Deleterious effects of OA were only evidenced when twinned with elevated temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis Although {{a number}} of recent studies of marine {{holoplankton}} have reported significant genetic structure among populations, little is currently known about the biological and oceanographic processes that influence population con-nectivity in <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton.</b> In order to examine how depth preferences influence dispersal in <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton,</b> I characterized the genetic structure of a copepod with diel vertical migration (DVM) (Pleuromamma xiphias), through-out its global distribution, and compared these results to those expected given the interaction of this species ’ habitat depth with ocean circulation and bathymetry. Mitochondrial COI sequences from 651 individuals from 28 sites in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans revealed highly significant genetic differentiation both within and among ocean basins. Limited dispersal among distinct pelagic provinces seems to have {{played a major role in}} population differentiation in this species, with strong genetic breaks observed across known oceanographic fronts or current systems in all three ocean basins. The Indo-West Pacific (IWP) holds a highly distinct genetic population of this species that was sampled in both the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. This suggests that the IWP does not act as a strong barrier to gene flow between basins, as expected, despite the relatively shallow water depth (5200 m) and vertically extensive (4400 m) diel migration of this species. A pattern of isolation by distance was observed in the Indian Ocean with genetic differentiation among samples down to spatial scales of 800 km, indicating that realized dispersal in P. xiphias occurs over much smaller spatial scales than in previously reported oceanic holoplankton.

The spatially extended phytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M Scheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal model, Oikos 62 (1991) 271 - 282]. Our {{results show that the}} spatially extended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena. The system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a constructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the oscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in the space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the external periodic forces can induce 4 : 1 and 1 : 1 frequency-locking and spatially homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are both turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4 : 1 frequency-locking transform into 1 : 1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to elucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide further analysis of Turing linear stability {{with the help of the}} numerical calculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are enhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate that the <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> bloom may partly due to interplay between the stochastic factors and external forces instead of deterministic factors.

40|$|Environmental context. Over {{the last}} twenty years, large and {{continued}} research efforts have been invested in deci-phering whether <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> contribute to the regulation of climate by the production and release of cloud-seeding atmospheric sulfur.

40|$|Changes in iron {{supply to}} <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> {{are thought to}} have a {{significant}} effect on concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide by altering rates of carbon sequestration, a theory known as the 'iron hypothesis'. For this reason, it is important to understand the response of pelagic biota to increased iron supply. Here we report the results of a mesoscale iron fertilization experiment in the polar Southern Ocean, where the potential to sequester iron-elevated algal carbon is probably greatest. Increased iron supply led to elevated phytoplankton biomass and rates of photosynthesis in surface waters, causing a large drawdown of carbon dioxide and macronutrients, and elevated dimethyl sulphide levels after 13 days. This drawdown was mostly due to the proliferation of diatom stocks. But downward export of biogenic carbon was not increased. Moreover, satellite observations of this massive bloom 30 days later, suggest that a sufficient proportion of the added iron was retained in surface waters.

Most field studies have focused on the effects of single metals. However, we propose that synergistic and antagonistic interactions between multiple trace metals could be very important in the oceans.

These antagonistic interactions could have the greatest influence on biological productivity in areas of the open ocean isolated from terrestrial inputs, such as the remote high nutrient regions of the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans. The emerging picture of trace metal-biota interactions in these oceanic areas is one in which biology strongly influences distribution and chemical speciation of all these bioactive trace metals.

Most biogenic sediment was composed of Foraminifera tests (tens of thousand tests cm- 3), Calciodinellum albatrosianum and Leonella granifera (Dinophyta) cysts (up to thousands cysts cm- 3).

The iconic example is the photosynthetic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium that establishes mutualistic symbioses with a wide diversity of benthic hosts, sustaining highly biodiverse reef ecosystems worldwide.

Here we report a new pelagic photosymbiosis between a calcifying ciliate host and the microalga Symbiodinium in surface ocean waters. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy, together with an 18 S rDNA-based phylogeny, showed that the host is a new ciliate species closely related to Tiarina fusus (Colepidae). Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts based on the 28 S rDNA gene revealed multiple novel closely related Symbiodinium clade A genotypes. A haplotype network using the high-resolution internal transcribed spacer- 2 marker showed that these genotypes form eight divergent, biogeographically structured, subclade types that do not seem to associate with any benthic hosts. Ecological analyses using the Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set (V 9 region of the 18 S rDNA) and contextual oceanographic parameters showed a global distribution of the symbiotic partnership in nutrient-poor surface waters.

Abstract: The zooplankton components in biogeochemical models drive top-down control of primary production and remineralisation, and thereby exert a strong impact on model performance. Who eats whom in <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> ecosystem models is often largely determined by body size. However, zooplankton of similar size can have different prey-size spectra. Thus, models with solely size-structured trophic interactions may not capture the full diversity of feeding interactions and miss important parts of zooplankton behavior. We apply an optimality-based plankton ecosystem model to analyse trophic interactions in a suite of mesocosm experiments in the Peruvian upwelling region. Sensitivity analyses reveal a dominant role of trophic structure for model performance, which cannot be compensated by parameter optimisation. The single most important aspect governing model performance is the trophic linking between dinoflagellates and ciliates. Only with a bidirectional link, i. e., both groups can prey on each other, is the model able to reproduce the differential development of the microzooplankton communities in the mesocosms. Thus, we conclude that a solely size-based trophic structure may not be appropriate to represent the most important trophic interactions in plankton ecosystems. The diversity of feeding interactions needs to be adequately represented to capture community dynamics...|$|E

Using field and mesocosm experiments, we compared predation on planktonic postlarvae swimming at night near the surface and bottom over coastal habitats along typical offshore–inshore transport paths and determined whether predation rates differed between lunar periods (new moon vs. full moon) and with prey density (i. e., predator encounter rates). We also measured predation on transparent (newly settled) and pigmented (nearing metamorphosis) postlarvae sheltering in coral reef, seagrass, and macroalgal habitats during the day. We measured predation on postlarvae swimming near the surface and bottom along typical offshore–inshore transport paths (i. e., coral reefs, coastal lagoon, and bay) by tethering postlarvae to floats that drifted on the nightly flood tide during new moon. To test the hypothesis that new-moon transport of postlarvae may have evolved {{as a means to}} avoid higher predation under the bright full moon, we repeated the pelagic tethering experiments at the reef and in the bay during full moon.

A number of species harbor eukaryotic microalgal symbionts, which are horizontally acquired in the environment at each generation. Although these photosymbioses are determinant for Rhizaria ability to thrive in oceanic ecosystems, the mechanisms for symbiotic interactions are unclear. Using high-throughput sequencing technology (i. e., 454), we generated large Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) datasets from four uncultured Rhizaria, an acantharian (Amphilonche elongata), two polycystines (Collozoum sp. and Spongosphaera streptacantha), and one phaeodarian (Aulacantha scolymantha). We assessed the main genetic features of the host/symbionts consortium (i. e., the holobiont) transcriptomes and found rRNA sequences affiliated {{to a wide range of}} bacteria and protists in all samples, suggesting that diverse microbial communities are associated with the holobionts. A particular focus was then carried out to search for genes potentially involved in symbiotic processes such as the presence of c-type lectins-coding genes, which are proteins that play a role in cell recognition among eukaryotes. Unigenes coding putative c-type lectin domains (CTLD) were found in the species bearing photosynthetic symbionts (A. elongata, Collozoum sp., and S. streptacantha) but not in the non-symbiotic one (A. scolymantha). More particularly, phylogenetic analyses group CTLDs from A. elongata and Collozoum sp. on a distinct branch from S. streptacantha CTLDs, which contained carbohydrate-binding motifs typically observed in other marine photosymbiosis. Our data suggest that similarly to other well-known marine photosymbiosis involving metazoans, the interactions of glycans with c-type lectins is likely involved in modulation of the host/symbiont specific recognition in Radiolaria...|$|E
40|$|Mixotrophy, {{which is}} the {{combination}} of autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition, is a common phenomenon in aquatic food webs. Mixotrophic feeding strategies are species specific and dependent on environmental factors, such as light and nutrient conditions. In contrast to the plankton, nothing {{is known about the}} occurrence and the ecological role of benthic mixotrophs. In the present study, mixotrophic nanoflagellates were investigated in coastal marine sediments. Their quantitative importance and their ecological role were investigated in dependence of light and nutrient conditions and along small-scale vertical and horizontal gradients at the main sampling site at Falckenstein Beach in the Western Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the significance of mixotrophs was compared in sediment and plankton in different systems along a salinity gradient and at different geographical sites, as well as in plankton and sea ice of the Greenland Sea. Mixotrophs showed varying abundances and contributions to the flagellate community, which could not be attributed to particular environmental factors in all cases. Disparate responses in temporal and spatial scales were attributed to differences in community composition of mixotrophs and in the relative importance of environmental factors that determine mixotrophic feeding strategies. Abundances of mixotrophs increased with increasing salinity. However, they contributed low portions to the total nanoflagellates (max. 7 %), with higher portions to the total phytoflagellates (max. 25 %) than to total bacterivores (max. 10 %). Highest contributions were found in sea ice and plankton of the Greenland Sea. Mixotrophic feeding strategies were proposed to play a greater role in <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> and sea ice than in coastal sediments...|$|E
40|$|As the eastward-flowing North Pacific Current {{approaches}} the North American continent it bifurcates into the southward-flowing California Current and the northward-flowing Alaska Current. This bifurcation {{occurs in the}} south-eastern Gulf of Alaska and can vary in position. Dynamic height data from Project Argo floats have recently enabled the creation of surface circulation maps which show the likely position of the bifurcation; during 2002 it was relatively far north at 53 degrees N then, during early 2003, it moved southwards to a more normal position at 45 degrees N. Two ship-of-opportunity transects collecting plankton samples with a Continuous Plankton Recorder across the Gulf of Alaska were sampled seasonally during 2002 and 2003. Their position was dependent on the commercial ship's operations; however, most transects sampled across the bifurcation. We show that the <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> differed in community composition according to the current system they occurred in during spring and fall of 2002 and 2003, although winter populations were more mixed. Displacement of the plankton communities could have impacts on the plankton's reproduction and development if they use cues such as day length, and also on foraging of higher trophic-level organisms that use particular regions of the ocean if the nutritional value of the communities is different. Although we identify some indicator taxa for the Alaska and California currents, functional differences in the plankton communities {{on either side of}} the bifurcation need to be better established to determine the impacts of bifurcation movement on the ecosystems of the north-east Pacific...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{assess the}} {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} metabolic rates (gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and the ratio GPP/CR) of <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> communities. We compile data from 133 stations of the Malaspina 2010 Expedition, distributed among the subtropical and tropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. We used the in vitro technique to measured metabolic rates during 24 h incubations at three different sampled depths: surface, 20 %, and 1 % of the photosynthetically active radiation measured at surface. We also measured the % of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) penetrating at surface waters. GPP and CR rates increased with warming, albeit different responses were observed for each sampled depth. The overall GPP/CR ratio declined with warming. Higher activation energies (E-a) were derived for both processes (GPP(Chla) = 0. 97; CRChla = 1. 26; CRHPA = 0. 95 eV) compared to those previously reported. The Indian Ocean showed the highest E-a (GPP(Chla) = 1. 70; CRChla = 1. 48; CRHPA = 0. 57 eV), while the Atlantic Ocean showed the lowest (GPP(Chla) = 0. 86; CRChla = 0. 77; CRHPA = - 0. 13 eV). We believe {{that the difference between}} previous assessments and the ones presented here {{can be explained by the}} overrepresentation of Atlantic communities in the previous data sets. We found that UVB radiation also affects the temperature dependence of surface GPP, which decreased rather than increased under high levels of UVB. Ocean warming, which causes stratification and oligotrophication of the subtropical and tropical oceans, may lead to reduced surface GPP as a result of increased penetration of UVB radiation...|$|E
40|$|Rhizaria are an {{important}} component of <b>oceanic</b> <b>plankton</b> communities worldwide. A number of species harbour eukaryotic microalgal symbionts, which are horizontally acquired in the environment at each generation. Although these photosymbioses are determinant for Rhizaria ability to thrive in oceanic ecosystems, the mechanisms for symbiotic interactions are unclear. Using high-throughput sequencing technology (i. e. 454), we generated large Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) datasets from four uncultured Rhizaria, an acantharian (Amphilonche elongata), two polycystines (Collozoum sp. and Spongosphaera streptacantha), and one phaeodarean (Aulacantha scolymantha). We assessed the main genetic features of the host/symbionts consortium (i. e. the holobiont) transcriptomes and found rRNA sequences affiliated {{to a wide range of}} bacteria and protists in all samples, suggesting that diverse microbial communities are associated with the holobionts. A particular focus was then carried out to search for genes potentially involved in symbiotic processes such as the presence of c-type lectins-coding genes, which are proteins that play a role in cell recognition among eukaryotes. Unigenes coding putative c-type lectin domains (CTLD) were found in the species bearing photosynthetic symbionts (A. elongata, Collozoum sp. and S. streptacantha) but not in the non-symbiotic one (A. scolymantha).
