5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and {{stay in touch with}} football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> in kickabouts.|$|E

At the end of the 1980–81 season, Blackpool were in the Fourth Division, the League's basement, for the first time. Ball had departed three months earlier, replaced by Allan Brown for his second stint in the Bloomfield Road hotseat. On 21 March 1981, Blackpool played their 3,000th match in the Football League. It occurred against Chesterfield at Saltergate.|$|E
25|$|A {{movement}} I consider dangerous (despite {{the great}} sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan <b>of</b> <b>youngsters.</b> A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; {{a few dozen}} innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes {{in the name of}} I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907).|$|E

25|$|Hopper's seascapes {{fall into}} three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he {{combined}} these elements. Most of these paintings depict strong light and fair weather; he showed {{little interest in}} snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted {{the majority of the}} pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on Monhegan Island. Hopper's The Long Leg (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his Ground Swell (1939) is more complex and depicts a group <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of Winslow Homer's iconic Breezing Up (1876).|$|E
25|$|Within three years, in the 1954–55 season, Drake had led Chelsea {{to their}} first league {{championship}} triumph. In doing so, {{he became the first}} person to win the league title both as player and manager. However, Drake never came close to repeating the success. The championship-winning side was gradually broken up, to be replaced by the crop <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> emerging from the club's youth team, such as Jimmy Greaves, Peter Brabrook and Bobby Tambling, for whom Drake was an aloof figure. Thereafter performances and results were very erratic, leaving the club stranded in mid-table; an FA Cup loss to Fourth Division side Crewe Alexandra weakened his position at the club and a few months later, Drake was sacked early into the 1961–62 season.|$|E

Their fierce support lead to an attraction <b>of</b> <b>youngsters,</b> who also fanatically support NAC. This fierce support lasts till now and is known in the Netherlands as an Avondje NAC (English; An Evening NAC). An Avondje NAC is a flamboyant mix of Burgundian fun, beer, fanaticism and love for the club and ensures that during home matches {{the atmosphere in the}} stadium is intimidating. On October 6, 1979, a strange situation occurred. During the home match against NAC’s rivals Feyenoord the linesman was hit by an ashtray. The referee postponed the match, riots broke out and the incident in the Netherlands is known as the ‘Ashtray Incident’.|$|E
25|$|The ELF {{initiated}} {{military operations}} in 1961 and intensified its activities {{in response to the}} dissolution of the federation in 1962. By 1967 the ELF had gained considerable support among peasants, particularly in Eritrea's north and west, and around the port city of Massawa. Haile Selassie attempted to calm the growing unrest by visiting Eritrea and assuring its inhabitants that they would be treated as equals under the new arrangements. Although he doled out offices, money, and titles mainly to Christian highlanders in the hope of co-opting would-be Eritrean opponents in early 1967, the imperial secret police of Ethiopia also set up a wide network of informants in Eritrea and conducted disappearances, intimidations and assassinations among the same populace driving several prominent political figures into exile. Imperial police fired live ammunition killing scores <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> during several student demonstrations in Asmara in this time. The imperial army also actively perpetrated massacres until the ousting of the Emperor by the Derg in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Development of Rang De Basanti {{originated}} with several ideas Mehra {{came up with}} early on but later dropped or greatly evolved into new directions. One of these involved a group <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> who worked in an automobile repair shop, while another was {{about the life of}} Bhagat Singh, an Indian freedom revolutionary. During this time, he personally conducted a survey with a group of youths in New Delhi and Mumbai about the Indian revolutionaries he was planning on depicting, which indicated that many <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> did not recognize the names {{of some of the most}} prominent revolutionaries. This led Mehra to believe that the sense of [...] "patriotism had blurred" [...] in the young generation. Because of this, he dropped his original plans in favor of a new idea in which a British documentary filmmaker on a visit to India realizes that the local [...] "kids are more Western than her". This new story, which eventually formed the basis for Rang De Basantis script, was influenced by Mehra's upbringing, youth and experiences over the years, including his desire to join the Indian Air Force while in school, as well as his recollections of listening to Independence Day speeches and watching patriotic films such as Mother India. Although Mehra denies that the film is autobiographical, he confessed that the character sketches were loosely inspired by himself and his friends.|$|E

[...] Wrexham midfielder Davies accused Arsenal of underestimating their opponents and felt their unrest at having conceded the equaliser worked to the home side's advantage: [...] "I {{thought they were going}} to be a lot more professional when they were leading and tighten it up. They treated it as a training match. We've got a team <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> and two old men and perhaps our desire to win was greater than theirs." ...|$|E

[...] She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life.

Reports of the games led to criticism from back home in Canada, which incensed Sinden. The team cooled off {{the next day with}} a session in Sodertalje playing for the employees of a Volkswagen plant. The team played mock games against local teams <b>of</b> <b>youngsters</b> 12 and 13 years in age. The practice improved the mood of the players. The team drank beer on the bus, and started [...] "singing songs like a bunch of kids." [...] Several of the players then went out drinking, impressing Sinden the next day with their best practice session to date. The time in Sweden helped bring Team Canada together as a team and focused them for the final four games.|$|E
