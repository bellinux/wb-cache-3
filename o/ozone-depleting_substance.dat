50|$|The {{ozone layer}} can be {{depleted}} by free radical catalysts, including nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydroxyl (OH), atomic chlorine (Cl), and atomic bromine (Br). While there are natural sources {{for all of}} these species, the concentrations of chlorine and bromine increased markedly in recent decades because of the release of large quantities of man-made organohalogen compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons. These highly stable compounds are capable of surviving the rise to the stratosphere, where Cl and Br radicals are liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Each radical is then free to initiate and catalyze a chain reaction capable of breaking down over 100,000 ozone molecules. By 2009, nitrous oxide was the largest <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> (ODS) emitted through human activities.|$|E
40|$|The phaseout of <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substances</b> {{substantially}} affects Department of Energy (DOE) operations {{associated with}} refrigeration and air conditioning, fire protection, and solvent usage throughout the complex.

40|$|Stratospheric ozone abundances are {{dependent}} on a balance of chemical processes that both produce and destroy ozone and dynamical processes that transport ozone throughout the stratosphere. The chemical processes depend on atmospheric temperatures and the abundances of <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substances</b> and other trace gases, such as water vapor and nitric oxides. Transport depends on heating in the atmosphere, which also depends on the distribution and abundance of trace gases, such as carbon dioxide, <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substances,</b> and ozone. Atmospheric temperature, transport, and trace gas amounts, for example, are all aspects of Earth’s climate. As these and other climate parameters change as result of human activities and natural variability, ozone abundances will decrease or increase in response {{in a manner that}} depends on a variety of factors...|$|R

50|$|Denitrification is a microbially {{facilitated}} {{process where}} nitrate is reduced and ultimately produces molecular nitrogen (N2) {{through a series}} of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products. Facultative anaerobic bacteria perform denitrification as a type of respiration that reduces oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxidation of an electron donor such as organic matter. The preferred nitrogen electron acceptors in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) finally resulting in the production of dinitrogen (N2) completing the nitrogen cycle. Denitrifying microbes require a very low oxygen concentration of less than 10%, as well as organic C for energy. Since denitrification can remove NO3−, reducing its leaching to groundwater, it can be strategically used to treat sewage or animal residues of high nitrogen content. Denitrification can leak N2O, which is an <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> and a greenhouse gas that can have a considerable influence on global warming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} gases used are [...] "green gas" [...] and propane which {{requires}} an adaptor. HFC-134a is also commonly used, particularly with pistols which have plastic sliders {{due to the}} lower pressure giving a smaller chance of damage to the weaker slide.

However it is unlawful to use HCFC-22 as a propellant in the US, {{as it is a}} Class II <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> and its use as an aerosol propellant has been banned since January 1994 under section 610(d) of Clean Air Act. Red gas is usually avoided unless the airsoft gun has undergone modification, as its relatively high critical pressure can cause damage to the airsoft gun, such as breakage of the slide or bolt.

5000|$|The {{first ever}} gas powered airsoft guns were {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "classic" [...] guns, owing to their age.

R-12 was a commonly used refrigerant for car air conditioning and refrigerators, and is considered a highly potent <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> and listed as a Class I Ozone Depleting Substance by the US EPA. Its use as a general purpose aerosol propellant has been banned by the US EPA since March 1978 under 43 FR 11301 for use in aerosol use with a very few exceptions.

40|$|The Montreal Protocol {{has succeeded}} in {{limiting}} major <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> emissions, and consequently stratospheric ozone concentrations are expected to recover this century.

The positive trend of this mode explains an enhanced total column ozone decline over the Eurasian continent in the past three decades, which is closely related to the polar vortex shift towards Eurasia. Multiple chemistry-climate-model simulations indicate that the positive Eurasia-North America dipole trend in late winter is likely to continue in the near future. Our findings suggest that the anticipated ozone recovery in late winter will be sensitive not only to the <b>ozone-depleting</b> <b>substance</b> decline but also to the polar vortex changes, and could be substantially delayed in some regions of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics...|$|E
