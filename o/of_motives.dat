5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction <b>of</b> <b>motives,</b> since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.|$|E

[...] More often than not, he talked himself into radical positions... as a result of trying to impress his peers or his girlfriend, or rebelling against middle-class parental authority". [...] Roy MacSkimming, book editor of the Toronto Star, says Satin portrayed himself as [...] "idealistic" [...] but also troubled and uncertain, wanting to fit in yet also longing to be unique.|$|E

Oborne argues that the MCC establishment, without favouring apartheid, wished to maintain traditional links with white South Africa.

500|$|An {{official}} novelization of the game, titled God of War, {{was announced}} in July 2009, along with a novelization of God of War II. It was written by Matthew Stover and Robert E. Vardeman, and was published on May 25, 2010, by Del Rey Books. In an interview for Play magazine, Vardeman said a mythology book written in the 1930s got him interested in Greek mythology, {{and the chance to}} work on the God of War novel [...] "was an opportunity not to be missed". He said giving the readers a solid plot foundation was necessary and the novel required extra material so that it did not simply follow the action of the game. Although he has not played the game, he said God of War was based on the traditional Edith Hamilton Greek mythology, essentially [...] "the accepted mythology on steroids". Vardeman called Kratos a substantial character, continuing, [...] "This conflict <b>of</b> <b>motives</b> makes him a great, if troubled, hero." [...] He confirmed his work on the second God of War novel, saying there are many potential story ideas for Kratos and that [...] "it would be a shame" [...] if there were not additional books to fill in the details of his quests, such as stories of the time while he was a minion of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King.|$|E
500|$|The {{first stop}} on the southward journey was at Lodi, where Wolfgang {{completed}} his first string quartet, K.80/73f. After {{a few days in}} Parma, the Mozarts moved on to Bologna, a [...] "centre for masters, artists and scholars", according to Leopold. Their letter from Firmian introduced them to Count Pallavicini-Centurioni, a leading patron of the arts, who immediately arranged a concert for the local nobility in his palace. Among the guests was Giovanni Battista Martini, the leading musical theorist of his day and Europe's most renowned expert in Baroque counterpoint. Martini received the young composer and tested him with exercises in fugue. Always with an eye upon Wolfgang's future prospects in the courts of Europe, Leopold was anxious for engagement with the great master; but time was short, so he arranged a return to Bologna in the summer for extended tuition. The pair left on 29 March, carrying letters from Pallavicini that might clear the way for an audience with Pope ClementXIV in Rome. Before they left, they made the acquaintance of the Czech composer Josef Mysliveček, whose opera La Nitteti was being prepared for performance. Later in 1770, Wolfgang would use the Mysliveček opera as a source <b>of</b> <b>motives</b> for his own opera Mitridate, re di Ponto and various symphonies. More broadly, it marked the beginning of a close association between Mysliveček and the Mozart family that lasted until 1778. Wolfgang used his works repeatedly as models of compositional style.|$|E
