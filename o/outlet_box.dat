40|$|The {{results of}} a {{systematic}} study investigating {{the effect on the}} sound insulation of wood stud walls having penetrations made by electrical <b>outlet</b> <b>boxes</b> are presented. The effect on sound insulation is shown to be almost negligible, regardless of box separation, if the boxes are themselves airtight and form an airtight seal with the gypsum board surfaces. However, if the boxes are not airtight, then the degradation to the sound insulation is strongly dependent on the separation between the boxes. Other significant factors include the presence of cavity absorption, and its method of installation. A series of retrofits for poorly installed boxes is examined and show that commonly available devices for reducing airflow (and sound insulation) through electrical boxes can be very effective but are highly dependent on installation.

5000|$|Three-prong plugs do not {{fit into}} the older, two-prong {{receptacle}}s. [...] When used as intended, the ground pin of the 3-wire receptacle is {{to be connected to}} the grounded cover screw, or to an external ground. In 1969 Underwriters Laboratories mandated three-prong plugs on major appliances for safety. At that time, only half of the receptacles in US homes were three-prong. Wiring in most homes did not include a grounding wire. The screws and <b>outlet</b> <b>boxes</b> were either connected to the neutral, or connected to nothing. Only in rare jurisdictions where non-metallic cable was prohibited and armored cable required (and still in good condition), do cheater plugs work as intended. In 1971, the US National Electrical Code (NEC) required grounded receptacles in all locations of the home (effective January 1, 1974).|$|R
5000|$|The High Rock Lake Wilderness is a {{wilderness}} area in Nevada containing the northern {{portion of the}} [...] Calico Hills. High Rock Lake, for which the wilderness was named, was created about 11,800 years ago after a large rockslide closed the <b>outlet</b> (<b>Box</b> Canyon) to High Rock and Little High Rock Canyons. This new outlet (Fly Canyon) cut a narrow canyon that empties at Soldier Meadows. One special geological feature in Fly Canyon is the potholes. The potholes were carved by whirlpool action of sand and gravel in the stream. Another unique feature is the Fly Slide where emigrants lowered their wagons with ropes into Fly Canyon portion of the Applegate-Lassen Trail. Elevations in the wilderness range from 4000 to 7660 ft with scattered vegetation of saltbrush and sagebrush.|$|E
5000|$|Termination {{points and}} {{junction}} boxes, {{in other words}} the entire circuit, must be completely protected. Often, termination points are left out, providing a weak link. Therefore, some enclosures are needed {{to be used in}} conjunction with MI cables. One may run MI cable into a box in an electrical room. However, just because that room may be a [...] "service room" [...] and may be subject to compartmentalization (fire protection), this does not mean one no longer requires a rated box or wrap around the electrical <b>outlet</b> <b>box</b> or junction box where the wiring is terminated because that box may be disabled {{as a result of a}} fire within the room. The probability of electrical fires are a strong motivating factor for compartmetalisation to begin with. The cable may thus be operable but the circuit as a whole may be defeated because the junction box would not have been protected. Such omissions are not entirely uncommon in the field.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{for the use of}} {{isolated}} grounds (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, separate from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the metal conduit, <b>outlet</b> <b>boxes,</b> and metal enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate {{all the way back to}} the point of earth grounding rod outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the comparison of two inlet boundary approaches of numerical simulations. The first approach is based on the simulation of a sufficiently long duct upstream the area of interest with known volumetric flow rate. The second approach rests on the experimental measurement of the section closer to the area of interest. The experimental measurement provides velocity profile and in addition turbulent intensity compared to the first approach where only a velocity profile can be computed according to known volumetric flow rate. A simplified model of car ventilation outlet was chosen as a test case. The model consists of circular and rectangular duct, area of interest (closing flap, vertical slats and horizontal slats) and <b>outlet</b> <b>box.</b> We have compared the two mentioned inlet boundary approaches for two distinct values of volumetric flow rate for which the experimental data of the section upstream of the area of interest are available.
