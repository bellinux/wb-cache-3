25|$|The Circuit and Supreme courts heard {{appeals and}} {{the matter was}} {{eventually}} consolidated with National Organization for Women et al. v. <b>Operation</b> <b>Rescue.</b> The case was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States on three separate occasions. A 2003 ruling that non-economic violence does not violate the RICO Act left other federal charges intact, including associated monetary damages and a national injunction against interference with abortion clinic operations, but the entire matter remained unsettled until the final decision in 2006 when the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in favor of Scheidler and PLAN (see below).|$|E
25|$|In A Christian Manifesto, Schaeffer's {{argument}} is simple. The United States {{began as a}} nation rooted in Biblical principles. But as society became more pluralistic, with each new wave of immigrants, proponents of a new philosophy of secular humanism gradually came to dominate debate on policy issues. Since humanists place human progress, not God, {{at the center of}} their considerations, they pushed American culture in all manner of ungodly directions, the most visible results of which included legalized abortion and the secularization of the public schools. At the end of -- A Christian Manifesto, Schaeffer calls for Christians to use civil disobedience to restore Biblical morality, which explains Schaeffer's popularity with groups like <b>Operation</b> <b>Rescue.</b> Randall Terry has credited Schaeffer as a major influence in his life.|$|E

He was also involved in protests related to the Terri Schiavo case. In 1998, Randall Terry ran for the United States House of Representatives in Upstate New York. Terry competed with radio station owner William [...] "Bud" [...] Walker for the Republican nomination to face Democratic incumbent Maurice Hinchey. Terry received the endorsement of Focus on the Family head James Dobson; however, national and state Republicans were not supportive of Terry's candidacy. Terry was defeated by Walker 53% to 35%, but was the Right to Life Party nominee in the general election. Terry came in third place, winning 7% of the vote, with Hinchey and Walker winning 62% and 31% respectively. In 2000, Terry and his son Jamiel promoted the candidacy of Steven Forbes in the Republican presidential primary. In June 2005, Terry announced plans to run in the primary against Florida Republican state senator James E. King, citing King's work in attempting to block legislation which would have kept Terri Schiavo alive.
