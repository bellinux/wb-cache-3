40|$|Life cycle {{assessments}} <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions {{have been}} developed for analyzing products "from cradle to grave": from resource extraction to waste disposal. Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production and to waste management, including CO 2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle assessments <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider ranging assessments allow for considering "trade-offs" between (reduction <b>of)</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions and other environmental impacts and co-benefits <b>of</b> reduced <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions. Databases exist which contain estimates <b>of</b> current <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However these data bases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions and <b>of</b> major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits and to establish major differences between competing products. They may also be helpful in the analysis and development of options, policies, and innovations aimed at mitigation of climate change. The main findings from available life cycle assessments <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions are summarized, offering guidance in mitigating climate change. Future directions in developing life cycle assessment and its application are indicated. These include: better handling of indirect effects, of uncertainty, and of changes in carbon stock of recent biogenic origin; and improved comprehensiveness in dealing with climate warming...|$|R
5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined {{with the fact that}} the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion years ago, it is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> on global warming.|$|E

5|$|Venus (0.7 AU {{from the}} Sun) is close {{in size to}} Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick {{silicate}} mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels <b>of</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> in the process. The feed {{conversion}} rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant.
