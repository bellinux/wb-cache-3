5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed that half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>settlement</b> be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E
5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>settlement,</b> a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>settlement,</b> Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E
