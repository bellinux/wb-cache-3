2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton covered hose, with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an <b>ozone-friendly</b> clean agent and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the only}} CFCs {{available}} to countries {{adhering to the}} treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled [...] "Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances". UNEP estimates that between 16,000–38,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production, South Korea later to ban CFC production in 2010. Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many banned CFC producing products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more <b>ozone-friendly</b> appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.|$|E

50|$|F-gases are <b>ozone-friendly,</b> very energy efficient, {{and safe}} for users {{and the public}} due to their low levels of {{toxicity}} and flammability. However, most F-gases have a relatively high global warming potential (GWP).

50|$|In 1995, {{preparation}} for production of refrigerators and freezers with the <b>ozone-friendly</b> refrigerant R134a commenced, and in 1997 production {{of these types}} began. Also in 1997, upgrades {{were made to the}} Baranovichi Plant's production, transport, storage, and assembly systems. In 1998 the first 700 Series refrigerators were produced, and the first two-compressor refrigerator, the MXM-1704.|$|E
50|$|Many systems {{still use}} HCFC refrigerants, which {{contribute}} to {{depletion of the}} Earth's ozone layer. In countries adhering to the Montreal Protocol, HCFCs are due to be phased out and are largely being replaced by <b>ozone-friendly</b> HFCs. However, systems using HFC refrigerants tend to be slightly less efficient than systems using HCFCs. HFCs also have an extremely large global warming potential, because they remain in the atmosphere {{for many years and}} trap heat more effectively than carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The fluids used {{in closed}} loops may be {{designed}} to be biodegradable and non-toxic, but the refrigerant used in the heat pump cabinet and in direct exchange loops was, until recently, chlorodifluoromethane, which is an ozone depleting substance. Although harmless while contained, leaks and improper end-of-life disposal contribute to enlarging the ozone hole. For new construction, this refrigerant is being phased {{out in favor of}} the <b>ozone-friendly</b> but potent greenhouse gas R410A. The EcoCute water heater is an air-source heat pump that uses carbon dioxide as its working fluid instead of chlorofluorocarbons. Open loop systems (i.e. those that draw ground water as opposed to closed loop systems using a borehole heat exchanger) need to be balanced by reinjecting the spent water. This prevents aquifer depletion and the contamination of soil or surface water with brine or other compounds from underground.|$|E

5000|$|By 1987, in {{response}} to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs {{by the end of the}} century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010 CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.Because the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably.

5000|$|The solid {{compound}} {{found inside}} the aerosol generator units uses environment friendly, naturally occurring potassium salts to extinguish fire by inhibiting the chemical chain reactions in the flame on a molecular level. On activation, the compound {{is transformed into}} a condensed aerosol consisting mainly of (K2CO3), (...) (vapor), N2 and CO2. The gas-type properties of the aerosol facilitate its even distribution in the protected volume as well as its flow into the natural convection currents of combustion. The solid particles of potassium salts, which are of a few microns in size, are suspended in an inert gas that displays a high surface to reaction mass ratio. When the aerosol reacts with the flame, Potassium radicals (K*) are formed mainly from the disassociation of (K2CO3). The K*s bind to other flame free radicals (hydroxyls - OH-) forming stable products such as KOH. This action extinguishes fire without depleting the ambient oxygen content. KOH reacts further in the presence of CO2 and forms (K2CO3). It is a sustainable approach that challenges conventional firefighting technologies of cooling, starvation or smothering. The physical and chemical characteristics of the technology do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has listed FirePro technology in its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the Clean Air Act. The Green Label scheme recommends that they are <b>ozone-friendly</b> and do not contain CFC’s. The National Aerospace Laboratory concludes [...] "that the Electronics Instrumentation test objects exposed to the action of the fire extinguishing agent FirePro have not been affected by their combined exposure to the condensed aerosol medium and to the exposure to a temperature/ humidity variation cycles." ...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} and {{characterize}} wear resistant and low friction tribopairs that are compatible with new <b>ozone-friendly</b> Isobutane refrigerant to run at hermetic compressor bearings. The tribological behavior of 100 Cr 6 steel pin is investigated under starved lubrication condition in air and R 600 a environments when running against sintered steel with and without steam treatment. EDS and SEM are carried out on pin and plate samples after wear tests. The results indicate that durability distance is lower for the tests with R 600 a than those with air. The adverse effect of R 600 a on wear rate {{is linked to the}} change in the viscosity and foaming characteristics of the oil in the presence of R 600 a as well as the lack of oxides.

40|$|The present article {{reports on}} the results of {{experimental}} research carried out on compact plate heat exchangers, currently used as evaporators and condensers in refrigeration loops. The research was aimed at getting information on the thermal efficiency of the heat exchangers, under reference commercial conditions, when using new <b>ozone-friendly</b> refrigerants to replace CFCs and HCFCs. Specifically, the influence of some thermal-hydraulic parameters on the heat flux and the overall heat transfer coefficient are investigated for evaporators, using R 134 a, R 407 C, and R 410 A, three fluids proposed to replace R 22, and HCFC, currently the most common refrigerant used in residential and commercial air conditioning equipment. Moreover, in this article a new thermodynamic method has been applied with the purpose of defining the saturation temperature and investigating the other main parameters for mixtures in the two-phase region for the fluids R 407 C and R 410 A, which are blends of, respectively, three and two pure refrigerants...|$|E
40|$|Sociological {{studies of}} global {{agriculture}} {{need to pay}} close attention to the protectionist aspects of neoliberalism at the global scale of environmental governance. With agri-food studies in the social sciences broadening interrogations of the impact of neoliberalism on agri-food systems and their alternatives, investigating global environmental governance (GEG) will help reveal its impacts on the global environment, global science/knowledge, and the potential emergence of ecologically sensible alternatives. It is argued here that as agri-food studies of neoliberalism sharpen the focus on these dimensions the widespread consequences of protectionism of US agri-industry in GEG will become better understood, and the solutions more readily identifiable. This paper illustrates how the delayed phase out of the toxic substance methyl bromide in the Montreal Protocol exemplifies {{the degree to which the}} US agri-industry may be protected at the global scale of environmental governance, thus prolonging the transition to <b>ozone-friendly</b> alternatives. Additionally, it is clear that protectionism has had a significant impact on the dissemination and interpretation of science/knowledge of methyl bromide and its alternatives. Revealing the role that protectionism plays more broadly in the agriculture/environmental governance interface, and its oftentimes negative impacts on science and potential alternatives, can shed light on how protectionism can be made to serve ends that are at odds with environmental protection...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performances}} of four <b>ozone-friendly</b> Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants (R 125, R 134 a, R 143 a and R 152 a) selected to replace R 12 in a vapour compression refrigeration system were investigated experimentally and compared. The performance in term of coefficient of performance (COP), refrigerating capacity (RC), and compressor work (We) were evaluated for the investigated refrigerants at various evaporating and condensing temperatures. The system performance increases as the evaporating temperature increases, but reduces as the condensing temperature increases. The results obtained showed that the investigated refrigerants confirmed that R 152 a and R 134 a have approximately the same thermodynamic performances similar to R 12 while deviation of R 125 and R 143 a were very large. But the best performance {{was obtained from the}} used of R 152 a in the system. As a result, R 152 a {{could be used as a}} drop-in replacement for R 134 a in vapour compression refrigeration system. The COP of R 152 a obtained was higher than those of R 12, R 125, R 134 a, R 143 a. Also, R 152 a offers the best desirable environmental requirements; zero Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) and very low Global Warming Potential (GWP) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the study are {{substances}} that are used as a working fluid in systems operating {{on the basis of}} an organic Rankine cycle. The purpose of research is to find substances with the best thermodynamic, thermal and environmental properties. Research conducted {{on the basis of the}} analysis of thermodynamic and thermal properties of substances from the base "REFPROP" and with the help of numerical simulation of combined-cycle plant utilization triple cycle, where the lower cycle is an organic Rankine cycle. Base "REFPROP" describes and allows to calculate the thermodynamic and thermophysical parameters of most of the main substances used in production processes. On the basis of scientific publications on the use of working fluids in an organic Rankine cycle analysis were selected <b>ozone-friendly</b> low-boiling substances: ammonia, butane, pentane and Freon: R 134 a, R 152 a, R 236 fa and R 245 fa. For these substances have been identified and tabulated molecular weight, temperature of the triple point, boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, the parameters of the critical point, the value of the derivative of the temperature on the entropy of the saturated vapor line and the potential ozone depletion and global warming. It was also identified and tabulated thermodynamic and thermophysical parameters of the steam and liquid substances in a state of saturation at a temperature of 15 °C. This temperature is adopted as the minimum temperature of heat removal in the Rankine cycle when working on the water. Studies have shown that the best thermodynamic, thermal and environmental properties of the considered substances are pentane, butane and R 245 fa. For a more thorough analysis based on a gas turbine plant NK- 36 ST it has developed a mathematical model of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) triple cycle, where the lower cycle is an organic Rankine cycle, and is used as the air cooler condenser. Air condenser allows stating material at a temperature below 0 °C. Calculation of the parameters of all substances in the model are based on a base "REFPROP". Numerical investigations on this model showed that the highest net efficiency will be at work on pentane. Butane and R 245 fa have the same net efficiency, for 0. 8 % lower than pentane. Ammonia has a net efficiency of 2. 5 % is lower than pentane. CCP net efficiency strongly depends on the condensation temperature of the substance, as for pentane at lower temperature of condensation at 10 °C it is increased by 1 %...|$|E
