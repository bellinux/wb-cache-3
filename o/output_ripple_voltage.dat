40|$|Abstract—Integrated {{switching}} power supplies with multimode control are gaining popularity in state-of-the-art portable applications like cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. {{because of their}} ability to adapt to various loading conditions and therefore achieve high efficiency over a wide loadcurrent range, which is critical for extended battery life. Constant-frequency, pulse-width modulated (PWM) switching converters, for instance, have poor light-load efficiencies because of higher switching losses while pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) control in discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) is more efficient at light loads because the switching frequency and associated switching losses are scaled down with load current.

Voltage-mode switching power converter {{is widely used}} to provide a stable voltage to the portable devices as it has higher efficiency than the current-mode counterpart. Frequency compensation is critical in the controller design as it not only determines the loop gain but also the stability and the dynamic response of the converter. However, the conventional dominant-pole compensation technique only provides a small loop gain crossover frequency and thus results in slow dynamic response. In this thesis, a new frequency compensation scheme, which consists of a single-pole error amplifier and a high-pass notch filter in the compensator, is proposed.
