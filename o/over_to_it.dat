25|$|In 1921, the US Army Air Service {{evaluated}} the Fokker D.VIII parasol monoplane, and the D.VII biplane, both fighters handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> after the Armistice with Germany that ended World War I. It placed {{an order for}} two examples of a parasol monoplane fighter based {{on the design of}} the D.VIII, but powered by an American-built Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine, for evaluation. These aircraft, designated by Fokker as Fokker F VI, had plywood-covered wooden cantilever wings similar to those in the D.VIII and the contemporary D.X fighters, and a typical Fokker welded steel-tube fuselage. The forward fuselage was protected by armour plates, although the car-type radiator and the wing-mounted fuel tank had no such protection. The aircraft had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, while it had no fixed fin, having a balanced rudder instead.|$|E

[...] The Israelis were pitted against the highly favored Mobilgirgi Varese, the champions of Italy.
