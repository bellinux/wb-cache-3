40|$|This thesis studies some {{security}} {{problems in the}} X. 400 Message Handling System (MHS). It focuses on the so-called message-token, a cryptological data structure, used to convey the security-related information and support several basic security services in X. 400 MHS. The current X. 400 message-token which conforms to the X. 509 <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol cannot protect X. 400 messages from the attack of impersonation. An exisiting solution {{in terms of the}} <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol still cannot solve this problem when it is applied as a message-token in MHS. This thesis develops three new message-tokens for solving the problem. Correctness of the new message-tokens is proved by means of the authentication logic, a formal analysis technique for checking if authentication protocols are able to achieve their goals. Through the study, some weaknesses have been found in the postulates known as the Hash-Function Rules. New Hash-Function Rules are proposed for improving the authentication logic. The newly proposed message-tokens are proved to be capable of ensuring the integrity and originality of the conveyed information and thus prevent the impersonation threat for X. 400 messages...|$|E

40|$|By {{interpreting}} {{message authentication}} as a hypothesis testing problem, this paper provides a generalized treatment of information-theoretic lower bounds on an opponent's probability of cheating in <b>one-way</b> message <b>authentication.</b> We consider the authentication of an arbitrary sequence of messages, {{using the same}} secret key shared between sender and receiver. The adversary tries to deceive the receiver by forging one of the messages in the sequence. The classical two types of cheating are considered, impersonation and substitution attacks, and lower bounds on the cheating probability for any authentication system are derived for three types of goals the adversary might wish to achieve. These goals are (a) that the fraudulent message should {{be accepted by the}} receiver, or, in addition, (b) that the adversary wishes to know or (c) wants to even choose the value of the plaintext message obtained by the legitimate receiver after decoding with the secret key...|$|R

40|$|Identification schemes are {{a common}} <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> {{technique}} for a user to prove himself securely to a verifier.

In this paper, we report on the developments in the area of reset attacks for identification schemes as well as for attribute-based identification schemes. Then we put together a new idea to construct attribute-based identification schemes secure against reset attacks. An identification scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows one party, the prover, to prove himself convincingly to another party, the verifier, without revealing any knowledge about his private key.

40|$|The Security Process Algebra (SPA) is a CCS-like {{specification}} languag e where actions {{belong to}} two {{different levels of}} confidentiality. It {{has been used to}} define several noninterference-like security properties whose verification has been automated by the tool CoSeC. In recent years, a method for analyzing security protocols using SPA and CoSeC has been developed. Even if it has been useful in analyzing small security protocols, this method has shown to be error-prone, as it requires the protocol description and its environment to be written by hand. This problem has been solved by defining a protocol specification language more abstract than SPA, called VSP, and a compiler CVS that automatically generates the SPA specification for a given protocol described in VSP. The VSP/CVS technology is very powerful, and its usefulness is shown with some case studies: the Woo-Lam <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol, for which a new attack to authentication is found, and the Wide Mouthed Frog protocol, where different kinds of attack are detected and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of wireless cellular networks has made security an ever increasing concern. GSM {{is the most popular}} wireless cellular standard, but security is an issue. The most critical weakness in the GSM protocol is the use of <b>one-way</b> entity <b>authentication,</b> i. e., only the mobile station is authenticated by the network. This creates many security problems including vulnerability against man-in-the-middle attacks. Several solutions have been proposed to establish mutual entity authentication. However, none provide a flaw-free bilateral authentication protocol. In this paper, we show that a recently proposed solution is vulnerable to a "type attack". Then, we propose a novel mutual entity authentication using the TESLA protocol. The proposed solution not only provides secure bilateral authentication, but also decreases the call setup time and the required connection bandwidth. An important feature of the proposed protocol is that it is compatible with the GSM standard...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Authentication {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} security objectives. The use of <b>one-way</b> chains in <b>authentication</b> was proved to be a very successful technique which encountered applications even in constrained environments such as ah-hoc sensor networks. This paper surveys some of the most efficient construction techniques for one-way chains and some of the most prominent authentication protocols that can be built on them. In brief, the construction techniques for one-way chains are categorized in two classes: one-way chains constructed from symmetric primitives and one-way chains constructed from asymmetric primitives. One-way chains were initially proposed for entity authentication; later their use will prove to be more successful in protocols for assuring information authenticity. We also categorize these protocols in two classes: protocols involving time synchronization and protocols involving an authentic confirmation...|$|R
40|$|The 2 G GSM {{communication}} system only provides <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> mechanism which just authenticate {{the identities of}} mobile users.

The first attack is IMSI/IMEI catch attack, which can get the mobile phone’s IMSI and IMEI. With this information, attacker can got the track of the man with this phone. The second attack is selective jamming attack. After get the IMSI and IMEI of the mobile phone, the attackers can decide whether the mobile phone is blocked or not.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we first}} define bisimulation-based {{non-deterministic}} admissible interference(BNAI), derive its process-theoretic characterization and present a compositional verification method {{with respect to}} the main operators over communicating processes, generalizing in this way the similar trace-based results obtained in [19] into the finer notion of observation-based bisimulation [6]. Like its trace-based version, BNAI admits information flow between secrecy levels only through a downgrader (e. g. a cryptosystem), but is phrased into a generalization of observational equivalence [18]. We then describe an admissible interference-based method for the analysis of cryptographic protocols, extending, in a non-trivial way, the non interference-based approach presented in [11]. Confidentiality and authentication for cryptoprotocols are defined in terms of BNAI and their respective bisimulation-based proof methods are derived. Finally, as a significant illustration of the method, we consider simple case studies: the paradigmatic examples of the Wide Mouthed Frog protocol [1] and the Woo and Lam <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol [25]. The original idea of this methodology is to prove that the intruder may interfere with the protocol only through selected channels considered as admissible when leading to harmless interference...|$|E
40|$|Key {{establishment}} {{is a crucial}} cryptographic primitive for building secure communication channels between two parties in a network. It has been studied extensively in theory and widely deployed in practice. In the research literature a typical protocol in the public-key setting aims for key secrecy and mutual authentication. However, there are many important practical scenarios where mutual authentication is undesirable, such as in anonymity networks like Tor, or is difficult to achieve due to insufficient public-key infrastructure at the user level, {{as is the case}} on the Internet today. In this work we are concerned with the scenario where two parties establish a private shared session key, but only one party authenticates to the other; in fact, the unauthenticated party may wish to have strong anonymity guarantees. We present a desirable set of security, authentication, and anonymity goals for this setting and develop a model which captures these properties. Our approach allows for clients to choose among different levels of authentication. We also describe an attack on a previous protocol of Øverlier and Syverson, and present a new, efficient key exchange protocol that provides <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> and anonymity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) for GNSS, a message-level {{authentication}} capability that aims at providing assurance of authenticity and cryptographic {{integrity of the}} navigation message. In designing a NMA scheme, there is an inevitable trade-off among security, resources (e. g. bandwidth and computational power), and performance (e. g. time to authentication of navigation message and authentication error rate). Other requirements may come from the channel dissemination performance (especially in harsh environments) and the complexity of key management. In this paper, we propose a novel NMA scheme that attempts to amortize the resources typically required for digital signatures by using a <b>one-way</b> chain of <b>authentication</b> tags of the message itself, rather than a chain of delayed keys as in TESLA based proposals.

40|$|As {{the world}} is {{becoming}} more and more connected due to humongous growth of the Internet, the task to secure a communication network is becoming more challenging. The communication system has evolved a lot since its inception to tackle the overgrowing traffic as well as the security challenges that come along with the increased traffic. The one thing that has remained common in all the communication or authentication systems is the use of a two-way communication channel (a channel which can transmit data in both the directions). A two-way communication channel can be a goldmine for an attacker, as it is a single point from where an attacker can grab all the data containing all the challenges and responses and therefore the attacker becomes capable of analyzing the data and plan network attacks. This project tries to design a <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> system to prove this idea as a proof of concept. With protocol design being the major part, the other part of the project is to discuss on the changes required and how can they be achieved in the current infrastructure to make the design backward compatible with the existing communication system.

(Computer Science) The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} (referred to as thesis in {{the rest}} of the document) is to present authentication techniques that can be used to provide secure Internet commerce. The thesis presents techniques that can be used to authenticate human users at logon, as well as techniques that are used to authenticate user's PC and the host system during communication. In so doing, the thesis presents cryptography as the most popular approach to provide information security. Chapter 1 introduces the authentication problem, the purpose and the structure of the thesis. The inadequate security of the Internet prevents companies and users to conduct commerce over the Internet. Authentication is one of the means of providing secure Internet commerce. - Chapter 2 provides an overview of the Internet by presenting the Internet history, Internet infrastructure and the current services that are available on the Internet. The chapter defines Internet commerce and presents some of the barriers to the Internet commerce. Chapter 3 provides an overview of network and internetwork security model. The purpose of this chapter is to put authentication into perspective, in relation to the overall security model. Security attacks, security services and security mechanisms are defined in this chapter. The IBM Security Architecture is also presented. Chapter 4 presents cryptography as the popular approach to information security. The conventional encryption and public-key encryption techniques are used to provide some of the security services described in chapter 3. Chapter 5 presents various schemes that can be used to provide computer-to-computer authentication. These schemes are grouped into the following authentication functions: message encryption, cryptographic checksums, hash functions and digital signatures. Chapter 6 differentiates between <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> schemes and mutual authentication schemes. The applicability of each approach depends on the communicating parties. Chapter 7 presents some of the popular and widely used open-systems technologies Internet protocols, which employ some of the schemes discussed in chapter 5 and chapter 6. These include the SSL, PCT, SHTTP, Kerberos, SESAME and SET. Chapter 8 discusses some of the enabling technologies that are used to provide human user authentication in a computer system. The password technology, the biometric technologies and the smart card technology are discussed. The considerations of selecting a specific technology are also discussed. Chapter 9 presents some of the techniques that can be used to authentication Internet users (human users) over the Internet. The techniques discussed are passwords, knowledge-based technique, voice recognition, smart cards, cellular based technique, and the technique that integrates Internet banking. Chapter 10 defines criteria on which the Internet user authentication techniques presented in chapter 9 can be measured against. The evaluation of each of the techniques is made against the specified criteria. In fact, this chapter concludes the thesis. Chapter 11 provides case studies on two of the techniques evaluated in chapter 10. Specifically, the insurance case study and the medical aid case studies are presented...|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{networks}} are innovative wireless networks {{consisting of a}} large number of low-cost, resource-constrained sensor nodes that collect, process, and transmit data in a distributed and collaborative way. There are numerous applications for wireless sensor networks, and security is vital for many of them. However, sensor nodes suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the lack of infrastructure, all of which impose formidable security challenges and call for innovative approaches. In this thesis, we present our research results on three important aspects of securing sensor networks: lightweight entity authentication, distributed node clone detection, and secure data aggregation. As the technical core of our lightweight authentication proposals, a special type of circulant matrix named circulant-P 2 matrix is introduced. We prove the linear independence of matrix vectors, present efficient algorithms on matrix operations, and explore other important properties. By combining circulant-P 2 matrix with the learning parity with noise problem, we develop two <b>one-way</b> <b>authentication</b> protocols: the innovative LCMQ protocol, which is provably secure against all probabilistic polynomial-time attacks and provides remarkable performance on almost all metrics except one mild requirement for the verifier's computational capacity, and the HB$^C$ protocol, which utilizes the conventional HB-like authentication structure to preserve the bit-operation only computation requirement for both participants and consumes less key storage than previous HB-like protocols without sacrificing other performance. Moreover, two enhancement mechanisms are provided to protect the HB-like protocols from known attacks and to improve performance. For both protocols, practical parameters for different security levels are recommended. In addition, we build a framework to extend enhanced HB-like protocols to mutual authentication in a communication-efficient fashion. Node clone attack, that is, the attempt by adversaries to add one or more nodes to the network by cloning captured nodes, imposes a severe threat to wireless sensor networks. To cope with it, we propose two distributed detection protocols with difference tradeoffs on network conditions and performance. The first one is based on distributed hash table, by which a fully decentralized, key-based caching and checking system is constructed to deterministically catch cloned nodes in general sensor networks. The protocol performance of efficient storage consumption and high security level is theoretically deducted through a probability model, and the resulting equations, with necessary adjustments for real application, are supported by the simulations. The other is the randomly directed exploration protocol, which presents notable communication performance and minimal storage consumption by an elegant probabilistic directed forwarding technique along with random initial direction and border determination. The extensive experimental results uphold the protocol design and show its efficiency on communication overhead and satisfactory detection probability. Data aggregation is an inherent requirement for many sensor network applications, but designing secure mechanisms for data aggregation is very challenging because the aggregation nature that requires intermediate nodes to process and change messages, and the security objective to prevent malicious manipulation, conflict with each other to a great extent. To fulfill different challenges of secure data aggregation, we present two types of approaches. The first is to provide cryptographic integrity mechanisms for general data aggregation. Based on recent developments of homomorphic primitives, we propose three integrity schemes: a concrete homomorphic MAC construction, homomorphic hash plus aggregate MAC, and homomorphic hash with identity-based aggregate signature, which provide different tradeoffs on security assumption, communication payload, and computation cost. The other is a substantial data aggregation scheme that is suitable for a specific and popular class of aggregation applications, embedded with built-in security techniques that effectively defeat outside and inside attacks. Its foundation is a new data structure [...] -secure Bloom filter, which combines HMAC with Bloom filter. The secure Bloom filter is naturally compatible with aggregation and has reliable security properties. We systematically analyze the scheme's performance and run extensive simulations on different network scenarios for evaluation. The simulation results demonstrate that the scheme presents good performance on security, communication cost, and balance...|$|E
