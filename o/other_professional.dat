The Society, recognizing its growing role in advocacy, established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in 1969 to better liaise between its membership and the government. Around that same time, the LSA began working with <b>other</b> <b>professional</b> organizations to meet and exchange research as part of the Consortium of Social Science Associations (COSSA). During the Reagan administration after cuts to social science funding in 1981, the LSA and 9 <b>other</b> <b>professional</b> organizations founded COSSA as an advocacy effort for the funding of social science research.|$|E
5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} {{to take on a}} larger role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order to act as a liaison between the members, federal government, and <b>other</b> <b>professional</b> organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 <b>other</b> <b>professional</b> organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of social science research.|$|E
