The latter included larger amounts of mortgages, credit-card debt, student loans and other receivables...For about five years those dealing in SIV's and conduits did very well by exploiting the spread...but this disappeared in August 2007, and the banks were left holding a very distressed baby.

50|$|The {{interest}} sensitivity gap {{was one of}} the first techniques used in asset liability management to manage interest rate risk. The use of this technique was initiated in the middle 1970s in the United States when rising interest rates in 1975-1976 and again from 1979 onward triggered a banking crisis that later resulted in more than $1 trillion in losses when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were forced to liquidate hundreds of failed institutions who had typically lent for long maturities at fixed interest rates (such as 30 year fixed rate mortgages) and borrowed for much shorter maturities. The interest rate sensitivity gap classifies all assets, liabilities and <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> transactions by effective maturity from an interest rate reset perspective. A thirty-year fixed rate mortgage would be classified as a 30-year instrument. A 15-year mortgage with a rate fixed only for the first year would be classified as a one-year instrument. The interest rate sensitivity gap compares the amount of assets and liabilities in each time period in the interest rate sensitivity gap table. This comparison gives an approximate view of the interest rate risk of the balance sheet being analyzed. The interest rate sensitivity gap is much less accurate than modern interest rate risk management technology where the impact of a change in the yield curve can be analyzed using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework based on the work of researchers such as John Hull, Alan White, Robert C. Merton, Robert A. Jarrow and many others.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> engagements of deposit money banks affect risk and profitability compositions of such banks. The study employed secondary {{data obtained from}} financial statements of five deposit money banks (namely, Access, Zenith, UBA, GTB and First Bank) for eleven years period (2004 to 2014). The descriptive and content analysis of the financial statements of the selected banks investigated revealed that Zenith Bank has the highest amount of <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> engagement.

40|$|<b>Off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> {{financing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular topics in the business literature today. It is popular because it is seen as a means to improve returns and bring value to the shareholders. This paper identifies four key components that must be considered to make a proper value judgment.

It then looks into how each of the different <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> instruments can bring value from these four components. The result was that <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing does bring value to a firm.

40|$|The present paper {{tries to}} analyze the {{accounting}} challenges that the implementation of EU Emissions Trading Scheme has risen. On 2 December 2004, IASB has issued an interpretation regarding the accounting of the GHG emissions allowances (IFRIC 3 „Emission Rights”). This interpretation should have been effective for annual periods beginning after 1 March 2005, {{the first year of}} the EU Emission Trading Scheme implementation. Less than a year after it was issued, IFRIC has withdrawn IFRIC 3. In December 2007, IASB has started a new project in order to provide guidance on accounting for carbon allowances called Emissions Trading Schemes Project. In the absence of an accounting standard regarding the accounting of these emissions allowances a diversity of accounting practices have been identified. Nowadays, there are three main accounting practices for the recognition of the emissions allowances and the GHG emissions liabilities: IFRIC 3 approach, the government grants approach and the net liability or <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> approach. The accounting treatment of greenhouse gas emissions allowances by Romanian companies resembles the net liability or <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> approach. Finance Ministry Order no. 1118 / 2012 states that GHG emission certificates should be recognized as fixed assets (if the entity is expecting a profit in the long term) or in the category of short term investments (if the entity is expecting a profit in the short term). The accounting of the greenhouse gas emissions allowances described above is applicable mainly to traders of such certificates and not for the installations in the scope of the EU ETS directive, which should recognize GHG emissions <b>off</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> at their nominal value (nil if received for free). The shortfall or excess of allowances will be recognized in the profit or loss as they are bought or sold by the entity (the accounting treatment imposed by Finance Ministry Order no. 3055 / 2009) ...|$|E
