5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts <b>or</b> <b>words</b> in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E

Playing with dice {{as a form of}} gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|For {{competitive}} programs, figure skaters {{were once}} restricted to instrumental music, including vocal music if it contained no lyrics <b>or</b> <b>words.</b> Beginning in the 1997–98 season, the International Skating Union decided to allow lyrics <b>or</b> <b>words</b> in ice dancing. Although {{the rules were}} not relaxed for singles and pairs, judges did not always penalize violations. At the 2011 World Championships, Florent Amodio's long program music included words but an insufficient number of judges voted for a deduction. In June 2012, the International Skating Union voted to allow skaters from all disciplines to choose music with words in their competitive programs beginning in the 2014–15 season.|$|E

Heterogeneity is the World Wide Web hypertext documents continually growing information sources, unavailability of parameter in the system, the automatic discovery, composition, and web-based information is the most challenging task to manage. In this study, while comparing the text <b>or</b> <b>word</b> disestablishment of vocabulary is encountered. To overcome this issue a method is proposed which incorporates the cosine metric factor to illustrate the relevance among documents while comparing with text <b>or</b> <b>word</b> <b>or</b> group of string. This study reveals efficient detection plagiarism through similarity analysis...|$|R
