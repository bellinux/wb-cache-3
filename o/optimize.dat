5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek to <b>optimize</b> {{the capture}} of solar energy in order to <b>optimize</b> the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of {{secondary}} structure transition {{is important for}} designing bistable DNA/RNA molecules. To make reliable molecular ma-chines out of such molecules, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the height of the energy barrier to the structure transition. This paper suggests three kinds of <b>optimized</b> transition path: the locally <b>optimized</b> direct path, the glob-ally <b>optimized</b> direct path, and the globally <b>optimized</b> path. These paths can be used as criteria for evaluating structure transitions. Then, we in-troduce algorithms to obtain or approximate these <b>optimized</b> paths. The algorithm that Morgan and Higgs used to obtain the globally <b>optimized</b> direct path is analyzed and improved as an algorithm on a bipartite graph. The algorithms are implemented as a C language program. ...|$|R

The {{two techniques}} demonstrate substantial performance gains of 2 - 8 dB over a conventional streaming system that is not R-D <b>optimized,</b> which corresponds to a significant fraction of the gain achieved by current (highcomplexity) R-D <b>optimized</b> schemes. Furthermore, this performance improvement is achieved with a complexity comparable to that of the conventional, non-R-D <b>optimized,</b> system. 1...|$|R
