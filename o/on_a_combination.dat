5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> {{of film and}} videotape.

Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight.

The successful strafing attack by Bf 109s of JG 52 on Manston depended <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of circumstances and chance which did not occur often during the battle.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing a game show for children, a first for the network.

Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap.

5|$|The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she {{explores the}} {{underwater}} world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns {{about both the}} history of the world and her own past.

Naija's songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{different}} specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers (warriors), Dark (dark knights), Gunners, Kanbus (ninja), Koas (paladins), and Somas (mages). A character's class determines {{what types of}} weapons and skills they can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one-hit attacks, the Koas focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E

5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend. The midday six-minute headways are based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead.
