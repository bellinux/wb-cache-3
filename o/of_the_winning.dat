5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S.

Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, all pitching, {{hitting and}} {{defensive}} contributions by the player {{are taken into}} account. Statistics are adjusted for park, league and era. On a team with equal offensive and defensive prowess, hitters receive 48% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>win</b> shares and those win shares are allocated among the hitters based on runs created. An estimation is then made to decide what amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defensive credit goes to pitchers and what amount goes to fielders. Pitching contributions typically receive 35% (or 36%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>win</b> shares, defensive contributions receive 17% (or 16%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>win</b> shares. <b>The</b> pitching contributions are allocated among the pitchers based on runs prevented, the pitchers' analogue to runs created.
