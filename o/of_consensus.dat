Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} social {{consensus}} system under {{the spread of}} negative emotions, the nonlinear emergence model of frangibility <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system is established based on Multiagent method, and effects of emotions spread frequency, opinion leaders, and shielding behavior of government on the frangibility <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system are revealed. The simulation {{results show that the}} low-frequency negative emotions spread is better than the high-frequency one for reducing the frangibility <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system. Low-frequency negative emotions spread will lead to the group polarization, while high frequency will lead to the collapse of system. The joining of opinion leaders who are with negative emotions can promote the frangibility <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system, and collapse speed <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system tends to increase with the influence of opinion leaders. Shielding behavior of government cannot effectively block the spread of negative emotions. On the contrary, it will enhance the frangibility <b>of</b> social <b>consensus</b> system...|$|R

Sergent This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} Hierarchical Coloured Timed Petri Nets to the modeling, the evaluation and {{the improvement of the}} performance <b>of</b> a distributed <b>consensus</b> algorithm. The asynchronous system model is augmented with Failure Suspectors, in order to overcome the impossibility <b>of</b> reaching <b>consensus</b> in the presence of crash failures. We consider here two different implementations of the Failure Suspectors: a general implementation that shows poor performances, and an implementation optimized for the execution <b>of</b> the <b>consensus.</b> The termination time <b>of</b> the <b>consensus</b> algorithm is determined by the communications cost, i. e., by the timing characteristics of the network used for exchanging messages. In other words, the network latency is taken into account in the system model. By simulating the consensus Petri net model it is possible to provide probabilistic guarantees on the termination time <b>of</b> the <b>consensus</b> and to compare the performances of the different implementations of the Failure Suspectors...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> {{regarding}} the exact import of the inscription, scholars {{seem to agree}} that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|Epatiana succeeded {{his father}} as King of Rurutu around 1886, while still a young child. Due to historians' lack <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> about his birth year, sources differ on the actual age of Epatiana at the time. This early {{succession}} was a consequence of a decision taken in old age by Epatiana's father to abdicate and journey back to his homeland of Huahine, where he died shortly after arrival. The body of Teuruarii III was repatriated to Rurutu and interred in the royal cemetery. Because of Epatiana's youth and inexperience, his mother Taarouru served as regent for an indeterminate number of years until the prince was deemed fit to rule independently.|$|E

There is a lack <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> about the precise {{meaning of the term}} 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E
5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{rising to}} power, Rajoelina {{dissolved}} the Senate and National Assembly and transferred their powers {{to a variety}} of new governance structures he made responsible for overseeing the transition toward a new constitutional authority.

In January 2013 he announced his decision to abstain from running in the 2013 general election, but in May 2013 he reversed this decision and submitted his candidature. A special electoral court ruled in August 2013 that his candidature was invalid and that Rajoelina would not be permitted to run in the 2013 election. He has declared an interest in presenting himself as a presidential candidate in a future election.|$|E

5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session {{beginning}} in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

For these two multiple subsystems, the terminal sliding mode (TSM) algorithms are designed, respectively, which achieve the finite-time reaching of sliding surface. Next, a switching control strategy is proposed to guarantee the finite-time <b>consensus</b> <b>of</b> all the states for multiple nonholonomic systems with disturbances.

25|$|Consensus (ijma) {{could in}} {{principle}} elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty. This classical doctrine drew its authority {{from a series}} of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error. This form <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form <b>of</b> <b>consensus,</b> which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.|$|E
25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> logos over sequence logos {{is their}} ability to be embedded as text in any Rich Text Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and consensus sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|E
