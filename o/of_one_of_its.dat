5|$|Considered {{to be one}} of {{the most}} {{impressive}} examples of medieval Bulgarian architecture, the Round Church takes its name from the distinctive shape <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> three sections, the cella (naos), which is a rotunda that serves as a place of liturgy. The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or narthex, marked by two circular turrets.|$|E

Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate.

40|$|Abstract. The “twisted Mellin {{transform}} ” is {{a slightly}} {{modified version of}} the usual classical Mellin transform on L 2 ([0, ∞)). In this short note we investigate some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> basic properties. From the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> combinatorics <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most interesting properties is that it intertwines the differential operator, df/dx, with its finite difference analogue, ∇f = f(x) −f(x− 1). From the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> analysis <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most important properties is that it describes the asymptotics <b>of</b> <b>one</b> dimensional quantum states in Bargmann quantization...|$|R

5|$|St-Calais was a Norman, and {{a native}} of Bayeux; {{he may have been}} a member <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{clerical}} dynasties. His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main source of information about his life, the monastic chronicle of Symeon of Durham, does not call him such.|$|E

The Chamber of Amsterdam was the largest with twenty members, mainly due to the city's population, and represented four ninths of the management of the West India Company.|$|E

5|$|Dunning {{remained}} in charge at Columbia until 1 May 1943, when the Manhattan District {{took over the}} contract. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it {{was working on the}} most challenging problem: the design of a suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, with Dunning becoming head <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> divisions. It would remain this way until 1 March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by Union Carbide.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010 {{airspace}} {{all over}} Europe was affected, with many flights cancelled-which was unprecedented-due {{to the presence}} of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. On 15 April 2010 the Finnish Air Force halted training flights when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Boeing F-18 Hornet fighters. On 22 April 2010 UK RAF Typhoon training flights were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet's engines. In June 2011 there were similar closures of airspace in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, following the eruption of Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, Chile.|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, but the film was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E

5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine {{has not yet been}} justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft, in 2000, {{released}} {{new products}} {{for all three}} lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw {{the beginning of the}} end <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most prominent legal cases. On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in Windows 2000. It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its Unix counterparts due to its usage of the Windows NT kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS emulator that could run many legacy DOS applications.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
