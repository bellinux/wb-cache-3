25|$|The {{earliest}} known telescope {{appeared in}} 1608 in the Netherlands when an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey tried {{to obtain a}} patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a convex <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> and a concave eyepiece. Galileo improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, Johannes Kepler described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as Christiaan Huygens were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.|$|E
25|$|Microscopes {{were first}} {{developed}} {{with just two}} lenses: an <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> and an eyepiece. The <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E

25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{diffraction}} patterns beyond point-position can be complex, as {{the image}} is sensitive {{to a number of}} factors such as specimen thickness and orientation, <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> defocus, spherical and chromatic aberration. Although quantitative interpretation of the contrast shown in lattice images is possible, it is inherently complicated and can require extensive computer simulation and analysis, such as electron multislice analysis.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> power.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} domain {{representation of the}} contrast transfer function may often have an oscillatory nature, which can be tuned by adjusting the focal value of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> This oscillatory nature implies that some spatial frequencies are faithfully imaged by the microscope, whilst others are suppressed. By combining multiple images with different spatial frequencies, the use of techniques such as focal series reconstruction {{can be used to}} improve the resolution of the TEM in a limited manner. The contrast transfer function can, to some extent, be experimentally approximated through techniques such as Fourier transforming images of amorphous material, such as amorphous carbon.|$|E
25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|E
25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of TEM, the associated technique of {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) was re-investigated and did not become developed until the 1970s, with Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago developing the field emission gun and adding a high quality <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> to create the modern STEM. Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular dark-field imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates. In 2008, Jannick Meyer et al. described the direct visualization of light atoms such as carbon and even hydrogen using TEM and a clean single-layer graphene substrate.|$|E
25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, {{which uses a}} microscope <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.|$|E

25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser <b>lenses,</b> the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses,</b> and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|R
40|$|Isotropic optical {{focusing}} – the focusing {{of light}} with axial confinement that matches its lateral confinement, {{is important for}} {{a broad range of}} applications. Conventionally, such focusing is achieved by overlapping the focused beams from a pair of opposite-facing microscope <b>objective</b> <b>lenses.</b> However the exacting requirements for the alignment of the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> and the method’s relative intolerance to sample turbidity have significantly limited its utility. In this paper, we present an optical phase conjugation (OPC) -assisted isotropic focusing method that can address both challenges. We exploit the time-reversal nature of OPC playback to naturally guarantee the overlap of the two focused beams even when the <b>objective</b> <b>lenses</b> are significantly misaligned (up to 140 microns transversely and 80 microns axially demonstrated). The scattering correction capability of OPC also enabled us to accomplish isotropic focusing through thick scattering samples (demonstrated with samples of ~ 7 scattering mean free paths). This method can potentially improve 4 Pi microscopy and 3 D microstructure patterning...|$|R
25|$|In some contexts, {{especially}} in photography and astronomy, aperture {{refers to the}} diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a telescope, the aperture stop is typically the edges of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter aperture. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In astrophotography, the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{improvements}} in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component achromatic lens of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated coma—an optical effect that can distort {{the outer edge of the}} image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> [...] in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer used a [...] Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8° south of the equator as their point of reference. (This was later named the Sinus Meridiani, and it would become the zero meridian of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature [...] "a".|$|E
