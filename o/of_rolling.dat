The principle of the waveform shaping is analyzed and different schemes <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> tool are built and discussed. After the selected of the most optimization <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> tool scheme, the parameter design <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> tool is calculated.

5|$|However, {{by the end}} of the year, the United States {{had failed}} to achieve the {{objectives}} <b>of</b> <b>Rolling</b> Thunder, because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government was not ready to quit the war. In response to domestic political pressure to do more, President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction. From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966–67, the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam’s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam. Again, America’s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign. For the third phase <b>of</b> <b>Rolling</b> Thunder, which occurred from spring 1967 to early 1968, bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi, Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border.|$|E
5|$|Several {{organisms are}} capable <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do {{not appear to}} play a {{significant}} role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristic <b>of</b> a <b>rolling</b> turbo is the strict connection {{of its value}} to market prices either at the stock exchange or in the off-board trade of the primary security. The value of the underlying stock is multiplied by the leverage value to give the value <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> turbo. Unlike other financial derivatives, the leverage <b>of</b> a <b>rolling</b> turbo is kept constant on a daily basis. However the issuer can change the leverage by a predetermined fixed procedure.|$|R
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the topography of the watershed consists <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> land that is densely settled.

5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser <b>of</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E

The scheme began with a trial on a single tram – number 3054 – connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network with the intention <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015.

5|$|Somerset is a rural county <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> hills {{such as the}} Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, {{and large}} flat expanses of land {{including}} the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, {{and later in the}} English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

The honey-coloured limestone at Ham Hill (also known as Hamdon Hill) is particularly important to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays {{and the way it}} relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity.

5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E
