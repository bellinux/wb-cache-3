5000|$|For shore-based <b>Optical</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems,</b> {{the lights}} are {{typically}} mounted on a mobile unit that plugs into a power source. Once set up and calibrated, there are no moving parts to the unit. Shipboard units are much more complicated as they must be gyroscopically stabilized to compensate for ship movement. Additionally, shipboard units are mechanically moved (the [...] "roll angle") to adjust the touchdown point of each aircraft. With this adjustment, the tailhook touchdown point can be precisely targeted based on the tailhook-to-pilot's eye distance for each aircraft type.|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} and naval air stations typically use Fresnel lenses in their <b>optical</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b> The [...] "meatball" [...] light aids the pilot in maintaining proper glide slope for the landing. In the center are amber and red lights composed of Fresnel lenses. Although {{the lights are}} always on, {{the angle of the}} lens from the pilot's point of view determines the color and position of the visible light. If the lights appear above the green horizontal bar, the pilot is too high. If it is below, the pilot is too low, and if the lights are red, the pilot is very low.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} {{equipped}} with two [...] "Mayak" [...] steam catapults made by the Proletarian factory, a ski-jump, and 4 arresting gear. For storage of aircraft, it had a 175×32×7.9-m hangar deck with aircraft elevated to the flight deck by 3 elevators with carrying capacities of 50 tons (two on the starboard side {{and one on the}} port). The stern housed the [...] "Luna" [...] <b>optical</b> <b>landing</b> guidance <b>system.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Regardless of {{the case}} {{recovery}} or approach type, the final portion of the landing ( [...] to touchdown) is flown visually. Line-up with the landing area is achieved by lining up painted lines on the landing area centerline {{with a set of}} lights that drops {{from the back of the}} flight deck. Proper glideslope is maintained using the Fresnel lens <b>Optical</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (FLOLS), Improved Fresnel Lens <b>Optical</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (IFLOLS), or Manually Operated Visual Landing Aid System (MOVLAS).|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{operations}} of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded {{on the development of the}} steam catapult, arresting gear, <b>optical</b> and radio <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b> The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile.|$|R

50|$|The {{flight deck}} of each ship is {{approximately}} 6400 m2. The deck has six helicopter landing spots, {{one of which}} is capable of supporting a 33-tonne helicopter. The 1800 m2 hangar deck can hold 16 helicopters, and includes a maintenance area with an overhead crane. To aid launch and recovery, a DRBN-38A Decca Bridgemaster E250 landing radar and an <b>Optical</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> are used.|$|E
50|$|Conventional ("tailhook") {{aircraft}} {{rely upon}} a landing signal officer (LSO, radio call sign paddles) to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as <b>Optical</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> have provided information on proper glide slope, but LSOs still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio.|$|E
5000|$|The {{large numbers}} of new ships, coupled with their larger [...] contemporaries, {{sustained}} the Navy's air power {{through the rest of}} the 1940s, the Korean War era, and beyond. While the spacious hangars accommodated the introduction of jets, various modifications significantly improved the capability of fifteen of the ships to handle the jets’ increased weight and speed. These modifications included jet-blast deflectors (JBDs); an <b>optical</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (a British innovation); greater aviation fuel capacity; stronger decks, elevators, and catapults; and ultimately an angled flight deck.|$|E

40|$|Environmental surrogates (land classes) for the {{distribution}} of biodiversity are increasingly being used for conservation planning. However, data that demonstrate coincident patterns in land classes and biodiversity are limited. We ask the overall question, “Are <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> effective surrogates for the spatial configuration of biodiversity for conservation planning?” and we address three specific questions: (1) Do different <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> represent different biological assemblages? (2) Do biological assemblages on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> remain similar with increasing geographic separation? and (3) Do biological assemblages on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> remain similar with increasing <b>land</b> <b>system</b> isolation? Vascular plants, invertebrates, and microbiota were surveyed from 24 sites in four <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> in arid northwest New South Wales, Australia. Within each <b>land</b> <b>system,</b> sites were located to give a hierarchy of inter-site distances, and <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> were classified as either “low isolation” (large and continuous) or “high isolation” (small patches interspersed among other <b>land</b> <b>systems).</b> Each type of <b>land</b> <b>system</b> supported components of biodiversity either not found, or found infrequently, on other <b>land</b> <b>systems,</b> suggesting that <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> function as surrogates for biodiversity, and that conservation-area networks representing land-system diversity will also represent biological diversity. However, the majority of taxa were found {{on more than one}} land-system type, suggesting that {{a large proportion of the}} plant, arthropod, and microbial biodiversity may be characterized by widespread species with low fidelity to particular <b>land</b> <b>systems.</b> Significant relationships between geographic distance among sites and differences among assemblages were revealed for all taxa except the microbiota. Therefore, as sites on the same <b>land</b> <b>system</b> were located farther apart, the assemblages at those sites became more different. This finding strongly suggests that conservation planning based on land-system diversity should also sample the geographic range occupied by each <b>land</b> <b>system.</b> Land-system isolation was not revealed to be a significant source of variation in assemblage composition. Our research finds support for environmental surrogates for biodiversity in conservation planning, specifically the use of <b>land</b> <b>systems</b> and similarly derived land classifications. However, the need for explicit modeling of geographic distance in conservation planning is clearly indicated. 19 page(s...|$|R

50|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, {{carriers}} {{evolved from the}} original straight or axial-deck configuration into the angled flight deck, with an <b>optical</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (OLS) providing glide slope information to the pilot. Initially, the device was thought able to allow the pilot to land without direction from the LSO. However, accident rates actually increased upon the system's initial introduction, so the system of using both the OLS and the LSO was developed. This development, along with other safety improvements, contributed to the US carrier landing accident rate plummeting from 35 per 10,000 landings in 1954 to 7 per 10,000 landings in 1957.|$|E
