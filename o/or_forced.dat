5|$|In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and Lismore {{became part}} of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Thereafter taxes on whisky {{distillation}} rose dramatically, and much of Scotland's distillation was either shut down <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry. The remains of at least two illicit stills from this period have been found on Lismore.|$|E
5|$|Indian Wars is {{the name}} {{generally}} used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between the colonial or {{federal government and the}} native people of North America. The wars, which ranged from the 17th-century to the early 1900s, generally resulted in the opening of Native American lands to further colonization, the conquest of American Indians and their assimilation, <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> relocation to Indian reservations.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July. The limited number of anti-tank guns present were exposed and quickly immobilised <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to withdraw. This left the infantry to be surrounded and large numbers were forced to surrender. Some soldiers {{made it to the}} positions of 19th Battalion, but it too became surrounded. By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> abortions.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to land at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E

5|$|Little Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> onto Indian reservations. Early settlers named Little Butte Creek and nearby Big Butte Creek after their proximity to Mount McLoughlin, which was known as Snowy Butte. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production. The city of Eagle Point was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|School {{attendance}} in Cameroon is also affected by child labor. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Labor Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor reported that 56% of children aged 5 to 14 were working {{children and that}} almost 53% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. In December 2014, a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor <b>or</b> <b>Forced</b> Labor issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs mentioned Cameroon among the countries that resorted to child labor {{in the production of}} cocoa.|$|E
5|$|The American airmen {{achieved}} considerable success against Japanese convoys. Two {{waves of}} aircraft from Task Group 38.3 attacked {{a convoy of}} 10 ships escorted by the seven warships of the 101st Flotilla near Quinhon in central Indochina and sank four fully loaded oil tankers, three freighters, the light cruiser Kashii and three small escort vessels. Another convoy was located and struck near Cape Padaran in southern Indochina, resulting {{in the loss of}} a tanker, two destroyer escorts and a patrol boat. A convoy comprising seven vessels was also attacked near Cape St. James in southern Indochina, leading to two freighters, three tankers, three destroyer escorts and a landing craft being sunk <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to beach.|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back to the ship. The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to ditch in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode had an interesting theme and {{that much of the}} drama was successful, the humor was too broad <b>or</b> <b>forced.</b> The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while the IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ã–sel. On 1819 October, Karlsruhe {{and the rest of the}} II Scouting Group covered minesweepers operating off the island of DagÃ¶, but due to an insufficient number of minesweepers and bad weather, the operation was postponed. By 20 October, the islands were under German control and the Russian naval forces had either been destroyed <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> to withdraw. The Admiralstab then ordered the naval component to return to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Women {{in areas}} under Indonesian control were also coerced into {{accepting}} sterilisation procedures, {{and some were}} pressured <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> outright to take the contraceptive Depo Provera. Village leaders were often urged to cooperate with TNI policy and local clinics responsible for administering contraceptive injections were established {{under the control of}} the TNI in the countryside. In one case specifically, a group of high-school girls were injected with the contraceptive without their knowledge. Other forms of birth control consisted of killing newborn children of women who were suspected of being associated with the Fretilin.|$|E
5|$|As {{with various}} other ethnic {{minorities}} {{who lived in}} the Soviet Union under Stalin, tens of thousands of Armenians were executed or deported. In 1936, Beria and Stalin worked to deport Armenians to Siberia in an attempt to bring Armenia's population under 700,000 in order to justify an annexation into Georgia. Under Beria's command, police terror was used to strengthen the party's political hold on the population and suppress all expressions of nationalism. Many writers, artists, scientists and political leaders, including the writer Axel Bakunts and the celebrated poet Yeghishe Charents, were executed <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> into exile. Additionally, in 1944, roughly 200,000Hamshenis (Sunni Muslim Armenians who live near the Black Sea coastal regions of Russia, Georgia and Turkey) were deported from Georgia to areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Further deportations of Armenians from the coastal region occurred in 1948, when 58,000 alleged supporters of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Greeks were forced to move to Kazakhstan.|$|E
