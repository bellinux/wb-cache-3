To assess performance, it is necessary to select, before the implementation of the project, indicators which will permit to rate the targeted outputs and outcomes. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an outcome indicator has two components: the baseline which is the situation before the programme or project begins, and the target which is the expected situation {{at the end of the}} project. An <b>output</b> <b>indicator</b> that does not have any baseline as the purpose of the output is to introduce something that does not exist yet.|$|E
50|$|In October 1950 a 12-hour race {{combined}} for SportsCars and Saloon Cars {{was held at}} the Brno circuit. The race organizers created an interesting and unique mathematical formula (the so-called power <b>output</b> <b>indicator)</b> to equalize the potential of all cars. The formula was based on a predetermined average speed that differed for cars with various engine capacity, and the corresponding distance expected to be covered by each car over the 12-hour period. The actual distance traveled by a car was then divided by this expected distance to arrive at a quotient, and the results were based on the values of this quotient. Consequently, even cars with the smallest engine size could win the race if they reached sufficient distance, while anybody failing to complete the expected distance was not classified at all. The calculation was further complicated by a provision that any lap completed below the projected average speed was not counted toward the total traveled distance. Consequently, the overall winner was Treybal with saloon Bristol, who reached a quotient of 1.268 while travelling 1121.158 km (4th longest distance). The pair Pavelka/Zd. Sojka with Tatraplán Sport covered the longest distance of 1192.933 km but their quotient of 1.098 was good for only 14th place in final classification. The race was seen as a great success, yet initial plans to hold a 24-hour race in the following year and thus establish an endurance racing tradition in Brno were eventually abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of competitive advantage. It helps a company to fuel the growth of new products and services, sustain incumbents, create new markets, transform industries, and promote the global competitiveness of nations. Because of its importance, companies need to manage innovation. It is very important for a company to be able to measure its innovativeness because one cannot effectively manage without measurement. A good measurement model will help a company to understand its current capability and identify areas that need improvement. In this research a systematic approach was developed for a company to measure its innovativeness. The measurement of innovativeness is based on <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> <b>Output</b> <b>indicators</b> are used because they cannot be manipulated. A hierarchical decision model (HDM) was constructed from <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> The hierarchy consisted of three levels: innovativeness index, <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> and sub-factors. Experts 2 ̆ 7 opinions were collected and quantified. A new concept developed by Dr. Dundar Kocaoglu and referred to as 2 ̆ 2 desirability functions 2 ̆ 2 was implemented in this research. Inconsistency of individual experts, disagreement among experts, intraclass correlation coefficients and statistical F-tests were calculated to test the reliability of the experts 2 ̆ 7 judgments. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the sensitivity of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators,</b> which indicated the allowable range of the changes in the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> in order to maintain the priority of the sub-factors. The outcome of this research is a decision model/framework that provides an innovativeness index based on readily measurable company <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> The model was applied to product innovation in the technology-driven semiconductor industry. Five hypothetical companies were developed to simulate the application of the model/framework. The profiles of the hypothetical companies were varied considerably to provide a deeper understanding of the model/framework. Actual data from two major corporations in the semiconductor industry were then used to demonstrate the application of the model.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an update of the ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> {{based on the}} latest available data, and provides {{a measure of the}} performance of the European Union (EU) and its Member States in ICT innovation. The ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> is the contribution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to the Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> elaborated by the European Commission in 2013. The contribution of ICT has been computed for each underlying component of the Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> for all EU Member States. Depending on the indicator component analysed and data availability, the ICT contribution to innovation can refer either to innovation in the ICT sector as defined by the classification of economic activities, or to ICT use as a general purpose technology {{in the rest of the}} economy. The up-to-date ICT contributions for the EU aggregate are: 1. 	 28 % in technological innovation as measured by patents; 2. 	 19 % in absorption of skills as measured by employment in knowledge intensive activities; 3. 	 27 % in competitiveness of knowledge goods as measured by exports of medium-high tech goods; 4. 	 20 % in competitiveness of knowledge services as measured by exports of knowledge intensive services; 5. 	 23 % in innovative firms’ dynamics as measured by employment of innovative fast-growing firms. All data refer to 2013 with the exception of data on patents which refer to 2011. The methodology to compute the ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> follows the one presented in "How much does ICT contribute to innovation output? An analysis of the ICT component in the innovation output indicator" (Pesole, 2015). The reader is referred to this report for more detail on the methodology. The 2013 EU aggregate ICT contributions are very similar to those in 2012 reported by Pesole (2015). The technological innovation component (i. e. ICT PCT patent) increased by two percentage points in 2011 (from 26 % to 28 %). Similarly, competitiveness of knowledge goods increased from 25 % to 27 % in 2013. The other contributions remain unchanged. The ICT Innovation <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> delivers a measure of output-oriented ICT innovation that captures both the technological and non-technological aspects of innovation in ICT and ranks Member States' performance.

40|$|The article’s aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comparative}} cross-section analysis of the innovative behaviour of the German manufacturing industry. The peculiarities of the food industry are tested in a combined analysis based on both input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Linear and logistic regressions are used to investigate {{the differences between the}} food industry and other branches of the manufacturing industry. In comparison to other branches, the food industry has lower research & development (R&D) expenditures whereas the import of research from more technology intensive sectors is high. Most of the released new products are improvements and imitations. Market novelties are rare. The development time for new products is relatively short compared to other industries, on average 8. 5 months. A major part of innovations are imitated rapidly by competing firms, therefore the first mover advantages are low. Due to the low newness of innovations, marketing activities (e. g. advertising, labelling) are more important for new product introductions than in other industries. The regression analysis for the input indicators measured by the innovation intensity shows that the innovative behaviour of food companies significantly deviates from other manufacturing sectors. However, the logistic regression analysis of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> doesn’t confirm these results. The dummy variable of the food companies has no significant impact on the <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Firms in the food industry might embark on imitation and product modification strategies. Therefore, they realize an average innovation output without spending {{the same amount of money}} as the other industries. In addition, it can be confirmed that small enterprises of the German manufacturing industry have a higher innovation activity in terms of both innovation input and output. The impact of business expectations on input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> is significantly positive. An international orientation measured by the ratio of exports to firm sales leads to a higher probability of introducing new products and novelties.
