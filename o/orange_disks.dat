50|$|Supaplex {{introduces}} {{a number of}} new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life-threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy's movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks. Utility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: <b>Orange</b> <b>Disks</b> work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the color vision of foraging Japanese yellow swallowtail butterflies, Papilio xuthus, involves simultaneous color contrast. We trained newly emerged Papilio to select a disk of pale green among a set of differently colored disks presented on a black background. When {{the same set of}} disks was presented on blue background, the pale green-trained butterflies selected blue-green. The difference in spectra between pale green and blue green was similar to the spectrum of yellow for human vision, suggesting that blue induces yellow. Similarly, the pale green-trained Papilio selected a more bluish spring green on yellow background. We also trained Papilio with <b>orange</b> <b>disks</b> and tested on a green and violet background. The results showed that green induced violet and vice versa. Taken together, we concluded that simultaneous color contrast of Papilio is similar to the effect of complementary colors in human color vision...|$|E

50|$|In 1977, distressed over {{losing their}} {{guaranteed}} {{seat in the}} Massachusetts General Court, inhabitants of Martha's Vineyard considered the possibility of secession from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, either {{to become part of}} another state (having received offers from both Vermont and Hawaii), reincorporating as a separate U.S. territory, or as the nation's 51st state. The separatist flag, consisting of a white seagull over an <b>orange</b> <b>disk</b> on a sky-blue background, is still seen on the island today. Although the idea of separation from Massachusetts eventually proved impracticable, it did receive attention in the local, regional, and even national media.|$|R
50|$|Outside of the UK, Belisha beacons {{are perhaps}} most {{prominent}} in New Zealand, {{where they are}} required at all marked pedestrian crossings. Traffic regulations require a controlling authority to erect on each pole indicating the presence and position of a pedestrian crossing either an internally illuminated amber globe not less than 300 mm in diameter, which has a lamp that provides 40 to 60 flashes per minute, or a 400 mm diameter fluorescent <b>orange</b> <b>disk.</b> The pole must be erected within 2 metres of each end of a crossing. The poles must be not less than 75 mm in diameter and not less than 2 metres in height, and must be clearly painted with alternate parallel bands of black and of white, each having a width of approximately 300 mm. Disks are a relatively new addition {{as a replacement for}} illuminated globes, having only become prominent since the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of behavioral studies on the color and polarization vision of the Japanese yellow swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus. We focus on indoor experiments on foraging individuals. Butterflies trained to visit a disk of certain color correctly select that color among various other colors and/or shades of gray. Correct selection persists under colored illumination, but is systematically shifted by background colors, indicating color constancy and simultaneous color contrast. While their eyes contain six classes of spectral receptors, their wavelength discrimination performance indicates that their color vision is tetrachromatic. P. xuthus innately prefers brighter targets, but can be trained to select dimmer ones under certain conditions. Butterflies trained to a dark red stimulus select an <b>orange</b> <b>disk</b> presented on a bright gray background over one on dark gray. The former probably appears darker to them, indicating brightness contrast. P. xuthus has a strong innate preference for vertically polarized light, but the selection of polarized light changes depending on the intensity of simultaneously presented unpolarized light. Discrimination of polarization also depends on background intensity. Similarities between brightness and polarization vision suggest that P. xuthus perceive polarization angle as brightness, such that vertical polarization appears brighter than horizontal polarization...|$|R
40|$|With {{respect to}} lateral {{diffusion}} of molecules, plasma membrane of living cells {{can be thought}} as a twodimensional fluid that is coupled to the underlying cytoskeleton. As the dynamics of cytoskeletal structures are often much slower than that of lateral diffusion, membrane proteins can become immobilized by anchoring to the cytoskeleton via direct or indirect binding. Motivated by single particle tracking observations showing that even lipid molecules are strongly affected by the membrane-cytoskeleton coupling [1], we {{study the effects of}} immobile particles on lateral diffusion. By considering a twodimensional hard-disk fluid, which is relevant when repulsive interactions are dominant, we explicitly account for fluid dynamical interaction between particles. We perform event driven molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations of a collection of hard-disks. We focus on fluids composed of uniform disks as well as binary mixtures. In the case of uniform disks, we envisage mobile particles as lipids and immobile particles as proteins anchored to the membrane skeleton. In binary mixtures, proteins and lipids are represented by disks of different radius and mass (see Fig. 1). Figure 1 : In A, a snapshot from the event driven molecular dynamics simulation is displayed, where red (larger) and <b>orange</b> (smaller) <b>disks</b> represent proteins and lipids, respectively, and the disks in black are immobile. The total packing fraction, that is the area covered by all disks, is equal to 0. 75. In B, the mean squared displacemen...|$|R
