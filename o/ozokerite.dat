2500|$|The basic {{distinction}} between the Edison's first phonograph patent and the Bell and Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was to indent the sound waves {{on a piece of}} tin-foil while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting or [...] "engraving" [...] the sound waves into an <b>ozokerite</b> wax record with a sharp recording stylus. At each step of their inventive process the Associates also sought out the best type of materials available in order to produce the clearest and most audible sound reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, <b>ozokerite,</b> barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

50|$|Its {{specific}} gravity ranges from 0.85 to 0.95, and its melting point from 58 to 100 C. It is soluble in ether, petroleum, benzene, turpentine, chloroform, carbon disulfide and others. Galician <b>ozokerite</b> varies in color from light yellow to dark brown, and frequently appears green owing to dichroism. It usually melts at 62 C. Chemically, <b>ozokerite</b> {{consists of a}} mixture of various hydrocarbons, containing 85-87% by weight of carbon and 14-13% of hydrogen.|$|E
5000|$|The mining of <b>ozokerite</b> {{began in}} Galicia in the 1880s, and was {{formerly}} carried on {{by means of}} hand-labor, but in the <b>ozokerite</b> mines owned by the Boryslaw Actien Gesellschaft and the Galizische Kreditbank, the workings of which extend {{to a depth of}} 200 m, and 225 m, respectively, electrical power is employed for hauling, pumping and ventilating. In these mines there are the usual main shafts and galleries, the <b>ozokerite</b> being reached by levels driven along the strike of the deposit. The wax, as it reaches the surface, varies in purity, and, in new workings especially, only hand-picking is needed to separate the pure material. In other cases much earthy matter is mixed with the material, and then the rock or shale having been eliminated by hand-picking, the [...] "wax-stone" [...] is boiled with water in large coppers, when the pure wax rises to the surface. This is again melted without water, and the impurities are skimmed off, the material being then run into slightly conical cylindrical moulds, and thus made into blocks for the market. The crude <b>ozokerite</b> is refined by treatment first with sulfuric acid, and subsequently with charcoal, when the ceresine or cerasin of commerce is obtained. The refined <b>ozokerite</b> or ceresine, which usually has a melting-point of 61 to 78 C, is largely used as an adulterant of beeswax, and is frequently colored artificially to resemble that product in appearance.|$|E
5000|$|While {{working as}} a mine guard, Maxwell {{discovered}} <b>ozokerite</b> near Colton, Utah, and filed a claim, then started the mining company [...] "Utah <b>Ozokerite</b> Company". The mine soon became the largest known <b>ozokerite</b> mine in the world, and Maxwell opened it to the public. Despite {{the success of his}} business venture, Maxwell for unknown reasons moved on, although it is believed he retained ownership of the mine. He surfaced in Goldfield, Nevada, where he worked for mining companies by spying on striking miners. Also while there, he killed a man named Joseph Smith during a dispute, but was not prosecuted. In 1907 he was involved in another gunfight in Utah, with a man named L.C. Reigle. Both were wounded, but neither killed. Maxwell was initially arrested, but again was not prosecuted.|$|E

It {{should not be confused with}} <b>ozokerite,</b> also a humic substance, similar in appearance, but apparently without medicinal qualities. In fact, neither of the substances, <b>ozokerite</b> nor shilajit, possesses any scientifically proven medicinal qualities.|$|E
50|$|Mining of <b>ozokerite</b> {{fell off}} after 1940 due to {{competition}} from paraffins manufactured from petroleum, {{but as it}} has a higher melting point than most petroleum waxes, it is still favored for some applications, such as electrical insulators and candles, or in extra-soft paper tissues.|$|E

50|$|As {{a chemist}} he {{conducted}} research involving reactions of metals with ammonia at higher temperatures, and performed investigations of substances such as amber, idrialite, <b>ozokerite,</b> asphalt and dopplerite. He also investigated the reactive behavior of potassium in liquid nitrous oxide, of phosphorus and antimony in liquid chlorine, and of iron towards oxygen {{at very low}} temperatures. In 1845 he discovered a process for preparing red phosphorus, a development {{which led to the}} invention of the safety match.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{the common}} {{minerals}} quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, muscovite {{as well as}} calcite, dolomite and gypsum rarer minerals occur, for example actinolite, allanite, andalusite, antigorite, apatite, arsenopyrite, baryte, cassiterite, chalcedony, chalcopyrite, chlorite, chromite, clinopyroxene, chrysotile, cordierite, cyanite, epidote, galena, garnet, goethite, graphite, hematite, hornblende, ilmenite, kaolinite, limonite, magnetite, manganite, marcasite, montmorillonite, prehnite, psilomelane, pyrite, pyrolusite, pyrrhotite, rutile, sillimanite, sphalerite, sphene, staurolite, tourmaline and zircon. Some very rare minerals do exist as well, like anglesite, autunite, beryl, cerussite, covellite, crocoite, greenockite, nontronite, pyromorphite, scheelite, native silver, stibnite and wulfenite, and also extremely rare minerals like chalcolite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, <b>ozokerite</b> (pseudo-mineral) and vauquelinite.|$|E
50|$|On {{distillation}} in {{a current}} of superheated steam, <b>ozokerite</b> yields a candle-making material resembling the paraffin obtained from petroleum and shale-oil but of higher melting-point, and therefore of greater value if the candles made from it {{are to be}} used in hot climates. There are also obtained in the distillation light oils and a product resembling vaseline. The residue in the stills consists of a hard, black, waxy substance, which in admixture with India-rubber was employed under the name of okonite as an electrical insulator. From the residue a form of the material known as heel-ball, used to impart a polished surface to the heels and soles of boots, was also manufactured.|$|E
50|$|These fine- to medium-grained rocks have {{a rather}} dark appearance, {{they are quite}} rich in green {{hornblende}} but nearly devoid in alkali feldspar (less than 10 volume percent). Their SiO2-contents are fairly low, so they compositionally approach dioritic rocks. In the past this facies has been extensively quarried (Tabataud quarry south of Nontron). Associated with this facies are several NW-SE striking mineralised veins that have been mined for lead, silver and zinc. Mining activity stopped in 1939. The Cantonnier vein is famous for very rare mineralisations. Besides baryte, calcite, chalcedony, dolomite, galena, marcasite, pyrite and sphalerite occur very rare minerals like anglesite, cerussite, crocoite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, <b>ozokerite</b> (pseudomineral), pyromorphite, native silver, vauquelinite and wulfenite.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, the 2nd Brigade of the Polish Legions {{operated}} {{in the area}} of Nadvirna. In the winter of 1914/1915, the brigade faced here the Imperial Russian Army, which planned to cross the Carpathian Mountains, and enter Hungary. In 1929, in a nearby village of Starunia, almost complete Woolly rhinoceros was found, preserved in <b>ozokerite.</b> This unique trove, one of its kind, is now kept at Kraków’s Nature Museum. Altogether, in 1907 - 1932, four rhinoceroses and one mammoth were found {{in the area of}} Nadvirna. In the interbellum period, the mammoth and one of the rhinoceroses were kept at the Dzieduszycki Nature Museum in Lviv (then Lwow). After World War II, they remained in the city, and are still kept in the now-Ukrainian museum.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} first settled in 1883 {{under the name}} of Pleasant Valley Junction, where the Pleasant Valley Railroad {{connected}} the mining town of Winter Quarters, 20 mi to the south, to the Rio Grande line. This line was soon abandoned, replaced by a Rio Grande branch along a much easier grade between Pleasant Valley Junction and Scofield. Pleasant Valley Junction quickly grew to include a store, hotel, and five saloons. In addition to the railroad, the mining and milling of <b>ozokerite</b> was important in the local economy. Sometime just before 1898 the town was renamed Colton in honor of railroad official William F. Colton. Two years later in 1900 the Scofield mine disaster dealt the entire area a serious blow, but Colton survived.|$|E
5000|$|After the Great War and the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918-1919, {{the area}} {{became part of}} the newly-reborn Poland. In 1920 the mining school was {{significantly}} expanded and was renamed to Carpathian Geological Station, a de facto oil mining university. As the capital of the Zagłębie Borysławskie (Borysław Oil Basin), the town of Borysław was the centre of then Polish oil and <b>ozokerite</b> extraction industries {{and one of the most}} important industrial zones of Poland. Because of that, on July 26, 1933, the town was granted a city charter. Together with the nearby settlement of Tustanowice (Tustanovychi, now part of Boryslav), Boryslaw produced in 1925 about 80% of Polish oil (812,000 tons). Boryslav was then commonly called the [...] "Polish Baku".|$|E
5000|$|Since that time, Borysław, as it {{was then}} called, was a small town related to the nearby {{metropolis}} of Lwów (currently Lviv, Ukraine) and mostly shared its fate. In 1772, during the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by Austria and became a part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. One of the great technological developments of the 19th century was the discovery by pharmacist Johan (Jan) Zeh (1817-1897, in nearby Lviv) of technology that led to the establishment of a new industry based on petroleum. Scientists worked out a method of distilling Boryslaw crude oil, and on 30 March 1853 made the first kerosene lamp. As early as 31 July 1853 their new lamp was used to illuminate the Public Hospital in Lvov. Their discoveries marked the beginnings of the rapid search for petroleum in the Carpathians—especially in the eastern sector of the mountain chain where rich oil deposits were discovered. In 1854 the first <b>ozokerite</b> mine was started in the town after the ore was discovered by Robert Doms. In the second half of 1853, following the research of Jan Zeh, and several other scientists working in the nearby city of Lemberg, the town and its surroundings saw the emergence of an oil industry. One of the first oil rigs in the world was built near Boryslav by Robert Doms in 1861. The oil and mining industries developed quickly. In 1909, more than 1,920,000 tonnes of oil were produced in the region—roughly 5% of the world's oil production at that time. The number of oil rigs also rose from 4,000 in 1870 to over 12,000 three years later. The oil boom drew many industry moguls from all over Austria-Hungary and many fortunes were earned and lost there. [...] A period of prosperity saw the city's population grew as almost 10,000 new workers arrived to the area. In 1886 an oil mining school was opened in Borysław, one of the first such facilities in Europe. Also the <b>ozokerite,</b> a natural mineral wax, mined in Borysław, was used for insulation of the first trans-Atlantic telegraphic cable line. On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borysław with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych, Ukraine) was opened.|$|E
5000|$|The Columbia Phonograph Company used Edison {{recording}} blanks until 1894. The North American Phonograph Company was {{dissolved in}} the fall of 1894, and Edison quit supplying blanks to Columbia, who had purchased 70,000 blanks from 1889 to 1894. Columbia was frantic to find a solution to make cylinder blanks in house, and the recipe for making Edison's wax was a well kept secret. Thomas McDonald started doing experiments with wax alloys with poor results: the records fogged or decomposed in the summer, just like the early Edison blanks. The Columbia company had a deadline to either supply recordings, or have their contracts cancelled and be sued for loss of records. Columbia resorted to attempt to steal secrets from Edison company by hiring old Edison Phonograph Works employees, such as Mr. Storms. Unfortunately for Columbia, the names of the components used by Edison were not labeled with ingredients but were instead indicated by number (i.e. 1,2,3 keeping the identities of these components a secret.) Paraffin, ceresine, and <b>ozokerite</b> all look similar, making the tempering agent even more difficult to be identified by the wax mixer. Wax mixers were given instructions on how much of the numbered components to put in the mixture, and how to process it, but no idea as to what the ingredients actually were. It took over a year for Columbia {{to come up with the}} formula for cylinders. Columbia placed an ad in the Soap Makers' Journal for a practical man to work with metallic soaps. Adolph Melzer, a soap manufacturer from Evansville, Indiana took the job. Melzer came up with a formula comparable to Edison's with the exception of the tempering agent (using cocinic acid, derived from coconut oil.) ...|$|E

It is known that biological activity of curative water Naftussya spa Truskavets’ (Ukraine) caused by its organic substances, genetically connected with Oil and <b>Ozokerite</b> from Boryslav’s layer, located near from Truskavets’. The low stability of water Naftusya defined our trying to reproduce its natural receiving in laboratory conditions. Aim: compare effects on nervous and immune systems of natural bioactive water Naftussya (BAWN) spa Truskavets’ and stable water solution of the <b>Ozokerite,</b> extracted from the Boryslav’s field. Material and research methods. The clinical approbation involved 27 volunteers with disfunction of immune and autonomous nervous system. Immune status evaluated on a set of I and II levels recommended by the WHO. About phagocytic function of neutrophils judged by activity, intensity and completeness phagocytose of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. About state of autonomous and central nervous system judged by parameters of Heart Rate Variability (“CardioLab+HRV”) and Electroencephalogram (“NeuroCom Standard”). After testing 20 volunteers drinked BAWN while 7 others volunteers simultaneously drinked <b>Ozokerite</b> extract during 7 days. Daily entering of organic substances (as C organic) for both groups makes 0, 3 mg/kg. Results. By method of discriminant analysis we detected 7 immune and 3 neural variables changes in which are almost identical in both groups. In particular, increases reduced levels Bacterocidity against Staph. aur., Killing Index against E. coli, Circulating Immune Complexes and Asymmetry of δ-Rhythm as well as normal levels Entropy of Immunocytogram and Immunity Integral Index while decreases raised levels Sympathetic tone, Centralization Index HRV and IgM of serum.
