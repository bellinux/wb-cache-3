5|$|Experiments {{with the}} fission <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> were already {{proceeding}} at universities and research institutes in the United States. Alfred Lee Loomis was supporting Ernest Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Vannevar Bush was also doing similar {{research at the}} Carnegie Institution. At Columbia, while Fermi and Szilard investigated the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction, Dunning considered the possibility, advanced by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler but discounted by Fermi, {{that it was the}} rare uranium-235 isotope <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> that was primarily responsible for fission. He had Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota prepare samples <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> enriched in uranium-234, uranium-235 and uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|Plants absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> {{in plants}} range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight concentrations <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in food plants are typically lower with {{one to two}} micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.|$|E
5|$|The Eldorado Mine at Port Radium was {{a source}} <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> ore.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{uranium metal}} {{contains}} about 0.71% U-235, 99.28% U-238, and about 0.0054% U-234. The production <b>of</b> enriched <b>uranium</b> using isotope separation creates depleted uranium containing only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins {{with such a}} low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities <b>of</b> depleted <b>uranium.</b> For example, producing 1 kg <b>of</b> 5% enriched <b>uranium</b> requires 11.8 kg <b>of</b> natural <b>uranium,</b> and leaves about 10.8 kg <b>of</b> depleted <b>uranium</b> having only 0.3% U-235.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> mining {{to extract the}} radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> {{are estimated}} to be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{beginning}} with 102 kg <b>of</b> natural <b>uranium</b> (NU), {{it takes about}} 62 SWU to produce 10 kg <b>of</b> Low-enriched <b>uranium</b> (LEU) in 235U content to 4.5%, at a tails assay of 0.3%.|$|R
50|$|CREN-K had 140 nuclear-fuel rods (LEU) {{from which}} two {{had been stolen}} in 1998. One of its two nuclear reactors, Triga II, {{consists}} of 10.5 kg <b>of</b> non-enriched <b>uranium</b> (U-238) and 5.1 kg <b>of</b> enriched <b>uranium</b> (U-235, enriched to 20 percent).|$|R
50|$|Approximately 90 micrograms <b>of</b> natural <b>uranium,</b> on average, {{exist in}} the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the skeleton. The {{biochemistry}} <b>of</b> depleted <b>uranium</b> is the same as natural uranium.|$|R
5|$|Decomposition {{of certain}} salts <b>of</b> <b>uranium,</b> for example UO2(NO3)·6H2O in air at 400°C, yields orange or yellow UO3. This oxide is {{amphoteric}} and forms several hydroxides, {{the most stable}} being UO2(OH)2.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Groves sent Lansdale to Europe, {{where he}} worked with the Alsos Mission to secure 1,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> ore from the German Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt. He also participated in the {{planning}} and execution of Operation Harborage, in which a special Allied force went deep behind enemy lines, seized 1.5 tons <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> ingots, and captured a number of German nuclear energy project scientists, including Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Max von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge and Otto Hahn.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
40|$|Existing thermal {{reactors}} are {{energy production}} scale limited {{because of low}} portion <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> usage. Fast reactors are limited by reprocessing need of huge mass <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> at the initial stage of development. The possibility of development of thermal reactors with high fission materials reproduction, which solves the problem, is discussed here. Neutron losses are decreased, uranium-thorium fuel with artificial fission materials equilibrium regime is used, additional in-core and out-core neutron sources are used for supplying of high fission materials reproduction. Liquid salt reactors can use dynamic loading regime for this purpose. Preferable construction is channel type reactor with heavy water moderator. Good materials for fuel element shells and channel walls are zirconium alloys enriched by 90 Zr. Water cooled reactors with usage 12 % <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> and liquid metal cooled reactors with usage 25 % <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> are discussed. Reactors with additional neutron sources obtain full usage <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> with small additional energy expenses. On the base of thermal reactors with high fission materials reproduction world atomic power engineering development supplying higher power and requiring smaller speed <b>of</b> raw <b>uranium</b> mining, than in the variant with fast reactors, is possible...|$|R
25|$|Nuclear {{power in}} the United States depends largely on {{imported}} uranium. In 2011, US uranium mining provided 8 percent <b>of</b> the <b>uranium</b> concentrate loaded into nuclear reactors. The remainder was imported. Principal sources <b>of</b> imported <b>uranium</b> were Russia, Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, and Namibia.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago was {{building}} the world's first nuclear reactor called Chicago Pile-1 {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project. This would have required an enormous number of graphite blocks and uranium pallets. At the time, there was a limited source <b>of</b> pure <b>uranium.</b> Frank Spedding <b>of</b> Iowa State University was able to produce only two short tons <b>of</b> pure <b>uranium.</b> However, a larger quantity <b>of</b> additional <b>uranium</b> metal was required for the pile to go critical.|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} , a white solid, {{is highly}} reactive (by fluorination), easily sublimes (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas), {{and is the}} most volatile compound <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> known to exist.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> that is depleted of uranium-235 {{and with a}} correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To {{be considered}} 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should {{be no more than}} 0.3%. The price <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Reactor efficiency. Conventional {{reactors}} consume {{less than}} one percent <b>of</b> the mined <b>uranium,</b> leaving the rest as waste. With perfectly working reprocessing LFTR may consume up to about 99% of its thorium fuel. The improved fuel efficiency means that 1 ton of natural thorium in a LFTR produces as much energy as 35 t <b>of</b> enriched <b>uranium</b> in conventional reactors (requiring 250 t <b>of</b> natural <b>uranium),</b> or 4,166,000 tons of black coal in a coal power plant.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the uranyl salts <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide {{cationic}} forms, the uranates, salts {{containing a}} polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, {{are generally not}} water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|Uranium {{deposits}} {{seem to be}} log-normal distributed. There is a 300-fold {{increase in}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade.|$|E
5|$|Uranium's average {{concentration}} in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25km (15mi) down is calculated to contain 1017kg (2lb) <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> while the oceans may contain 1013kg (2lb). The concentration <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its {{concentration in}} sea water is 3 parts per billion.|$|E

5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1952, uranium {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant (now: Silmet).
