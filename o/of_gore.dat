5|$|Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rated Ninja Gaiden and Black, {{on their}} release, as 18+ games. At the time, CERO ratings acted as {{guidelines}} for consumers. However, on March 1, 2006, the Japanese rating system changed. A scale from A to D was introduced, {{with an additional}} Z rating for games with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>gore</b> and sexual content. The Z rating is legally enforced, it being illegal to sell such games to anyone {{under the age of}} 18. As a result, Tecmo removed the human beheadings in Sigma to obtain a D rating for the East Asian market. However, CERO reclassified the two previous games as D, despite them also depicting human decapitations.|$|E

5|$|On July 7, 1947, another {{modification}} to {{the route}} was made, moving its western terminus {{from the northern}} portion of the panhandle to a new roadway in the southern section. The next significant change to the highway took place on April 4, 1960, when it was realigned to the north between the cities <b>of</b> <b>Gore</b> and Vian. Two years later, on April 4, 1962, US-64 was relocated to the north west of Tulsa, near Sand Springs. On November 4, 1963, a bypass was added through the city of Enid. It was designated as US-64 Bypass and ran on Willow Avenue and 30th Street. A couple of months later, on February 3, 1964, US-64 was moved onto a freeway through the southeastern portion of Tulsa. Later, on December 1 of the same year, similar reroutings through Tulsa and Broken Arrow were approved by the Oklahoma Department of Highways.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} Cao Qin's failed uprising, the Mongol leader Bolai, {{who had been}} staging raids into {{northern}} China, sent an embassy into China to request formal tribute relations and {{to serve as a}} vassal to the Ming. News of this rebellion reached the Joseon court of Korea by September 9, while the Korean official in charge of the report perhaps embellished the level <b>of</b> <b>gore</b> and violence by stating that tens of thousands had died and the three days of pouring rain following the rebellion flooded even the Forbidden City with streams of blood and rain. A native rebellion would not threaten the capital city again until the fall of Beijing to the army of Li Zicheng in 1644, marking the end of the dynasty and, shortly after, the beginning of Manchu conquest. Until the conquest of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Chinese officials continued to show a large degree of apprehension over Mongols in military service to the Ming, and still favored relocation schemes. However, Cao's rebellion marked the last event when Ming Mongols were of great importance to court affairs; although many Mongol officers retained hereditary titles of noble lineage, the nobility within the military command structure declined as a whole while men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E
