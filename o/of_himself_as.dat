5|$|Hergé's {{decision}} {{to name a}} character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his friend and colleague, the former opera singer Edgar P.

Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a candidate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E

5|$|In Lenin's absence, Stalin {{had begun}} {{consolidating}} his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating an image <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who {{had access to}} him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He thought <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities {{as a result of}} slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E

5|$|Lopez {{developed}} a large practice among powerful people, including Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester {{and the principal}} secretary Sir Francis Walsingham, and in 1581 he was made physician-in-chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England and her household, with a life pension of £50 per year. In June 1584, Elizabeth granted him a monopoly on the importation of aniseed and sumac to England for ten years; this was renewed in January 1593. In 1588 he was given land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the Bishop of Worcester Edmund Freke. Gabriel Harvey, an English scholar of the era, remarked on Lopez's rise on the title page of a book he owned, Judaeorum Medicastrorum calumnias:Doctor Lopus, the Queenes physitian, is descended of Jewes: but himselfe A Christian, & Portugall. He none of the learnedest, or expertest physitians in ye Court: but one, that maketh as great account <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> the best: & {{by a kind of}} Jewish practis, hath growen to much wealth, & sum reputation: aswell with ye Queen herselfe as with sum of ye greatest Lordes, & Ladyes.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{was the first}} of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played. In that Game 7, the Sixers could not get their act together: 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one. Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly (Hal Greer, Wali Jones, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9, the center himself scored only 14 points. In the second half of Game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field. Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game: in a typical Sixers game, Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post, but only 23 times in Game 7, and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point which the coach conceded himself, but Cherry points out that Chamberlain, who always thought <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the best player of all time, should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself. The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics.|$|E

That same year, Wario was also in the video game , a remake of a Bomberman title for the Game Boy which incorporated Wario as a playable character. Wario has been a playable character in the Mario Kart series starting with Mario Kart 64 , he has appeared in 30 Mario sports games, including the Mario Tennis, Mario Golf, Mario Baseball, Mario Strikers, and Mario & Sonic series. Wario has also appeared in all installments of the Mario Party series except Mario Party Advance. Wario is a playable character in 2 platformers for the Nintendo DS, the remake Super Mario 64 DS (2004) and Yoshi's Island DS (2006) as an infant version <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> well as the 2001 puzzle game Dr. Mario 64.

Wario's cameos include aiding protagonist Stafy in the video game Densetsu no Stafy 3 and being present in the scenery of Pilotwings 64. Wario appears in Super Mario Maker as a Mystery Mushroom costume, once again sporting his biker attire from the WarioWare games. The Super Mario Adventures graphic novel, which is a collection of comics originally serialized in the video gaming magazine Nintendo Power, features Wario in two of the stories. One of the stories focuses on Wario's past, explaining his rivalry with Mario.|$|E
