50|$|In {{order to}} fashion his concept <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, {{including}} economics, history, communications and technology.|$|R
50|$|In 1624, in England, the Statute <b>of</b> <b>Monopolies</b> {{was passed}} {{primarily}} {{to restrict the}} power of the sovereign in granting <b>monopolies.</b> The Statute <b>of</b> <b>Monopolies,</b> {{for the first time in}} history, defined the following: that inventions had to be “new” to attain a monopoly, and that a monopoly would be granted only for a limited period of time (in this case 14 years.) These aspects have carried forward and helped shape the United States Patent Law. The Statute <b>of</b> <b>Monopolies</b> attempted to reinforce the advantages to society of new inventions; however, a French Patent Law, established in 1791, focused on the inventor and emphasized the invention as the inventor's property. The US Patent Law today adopts both streams of thought; however, the concept <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> and patents, in the US, initiated with the British thought of advantages to society.|$|R
40|$|The author {{examines}} institutional, as well {{as economic}} approaches to natural monopolies investigation. Institutional peculiarities of their development are analyzed; the structure of the institutional environment <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies</b> is characterized. The problems of regulation <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies</b> are identified. The process of regulation <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies</b> is considered through the prism of the effect of dynamic inconsistency. The formal and informal interaction <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies</b> and government agencies are defined. It is proposed a step-by-step state regulation <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies</b> with due regard for market instructions maturity. There are formulated additional measures of state regulation <b>of</b> natural <b>monopolies...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} the board game Monopoly {{can be traced back}} to the early 20th century. The {{earliest}} known version <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly,</b> known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly</b> sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.|$|E
5|$|Various patents {{have existed}} {{on the game}} <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly</b> and its predecessors, such as The Landlord's Game, but all have now expired. The {{specific}} graphics of the game board, cards, and pieces are protected by copyright law and trademark law, as is the specific wording of the game's rules.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly</b> for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was {{released}} in a gold box. In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly.</b> Voters were allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money — with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free phone number, and at FAO Schwarz stores.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly.</b> The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E

Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to pull her off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E

On each of the many occasions a similar question was asked at a referendum the public decided not to vest power in the Commonwealth over these matters.|$|R
5|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{of the game}} have created dozens of officially licensed versions, in which {{the names of the}} properties and other elements of the game are replaced by others according to the game's theme. The first such license was awarded in 1994, to the company that became USAopoly, starting with a San Diego edition <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly</b> and later including themes such as national parks, Star Trek, Star Wars, Nintendo, Disney characters, Pokémon, Peanuts, various particular cities (such as Las Vegas and New York City), states, colleges and universities, the World Cup, NASCAR, individual professional sports teams, and many others. USAopoly also sells special corporate editions <b>of</b> <b>Monopoly.</b> Official corporate editions have been produced for Best Buy, the Boy Scouts of America, FedEx, and UPS, among others. In 1995, a second license was awarded to Winning Moves Games in Massachusetts. Winning Moves has produced a new board game and card games based on Monopoly in the United States. Winning Moves also produces official localized editions of the game in the UK, France, Germany and Australia. The Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition Monopoly is a special case, having been originally produced by Winning Moves in the UK, and resold by USAopoly within the US. A third license was awarded in 2000 by Hasbro to Winning Solutions, Inc., which produces specialty deluxe editions mostly for sale by specialized retailers. Other licensed localized editions of the game are being published in Nigeria and The Netherlands, among other locations.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
