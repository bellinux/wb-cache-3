5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R sound of her previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E

5|$|Clash of Ninja was {{originally}} released in Japan on April 11, 2003, {{and the game}} was subsequently released in North America on March 7, 2006, with the only major difference being the voice-overs by the English voice actors from the Naruto anime.

5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exact nature of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Critics and {{the band}} have given mixed <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album, though guitarist Steve Hackett has said it is his {{favourite}} Genesis record.

Several of the album tracks became fan favourites and featured as {{a regular part of}} the band's live setlist into the 1980s.|$|E

Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time, Châu had been captured and sentenced to death, before having his sentence reduced to house arrest. Cẩn regularly traveled to Châu's sampan on the Perfume River with gifts of food and listened to Châu's political lectures. Regarded as the least educated of his family, Cẩn had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ngô brother not to have studied at a European-run institution.|$|E

5|$|Kripke was {{developing}} the concept {{for ten years}} before it was greenlit as a television series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead actors' performances.|$|E
5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, rather than simply distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality of the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} the relationship between enjoyment of music in a live setting and enjoyment of wine consumed while at the concert. Surveys were collected from 113 respondents throughout <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 2011 at San Luis Obispo’s “Concerts in the Plaza. ” J. Lohr Vineyards and Wines was the wine sponsor throughout the summer concert series, which represented a wide variety of musical genres. Overall, 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample was women, 69 % drank white wine, and 93 % had tried J. Lohr wines before the event. With regard to wine <b>opinion,</b> 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample maintained <b>the</b> same <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine before and during the live music event. Regression analysis was used to explain <b>the</b> change in <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine by various factors such as <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> music at <b>the</b> event and previous <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine. <b>The</b> analysis suggests that <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> live music was not a statistically significant factor influencing <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine consumed at the live music event. The only variables that significantly influenced <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine at <b>the</b> concert were <b>the</b> respondents’ previous <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine and frequency of listening to music while drinking wine. Both of these variables positively correlated with <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> wine consumed at the event. The inability for the respondent to separate previous and current <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine could have contributed to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> significant results, as on average the sample had a somewhat positive <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine before and after <b>the</b> concert, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents’ <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> live music. Recommendations for further research include isolating the wine and music variables so no outside factors influence opinion. Serving the wine to respondents without their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brand would eliminate their ability to associate previous opinions with the current experience influenced by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> varying music...|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{have high}} {{marks on the}} game's cast of characters, but were divided in their <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choice of voice actors. GameTrailers's {{reviewer}} disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike the critic from GameTrailers, G4's reviewer praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the unexpected critical success that its predecessor, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, received in North America. Game director Kotaro Uchikoshi wrote the script, which was then localized by Aksys Games and Rising Star Games for North America and Europe respectively. Virtue's Last Reward was released to positive reviews. Critics praised the story and characters but were divided in their <b>opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Escape sections. Despite positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure in Japan, which led to the temporary cancellation of its sequel. Development on the sequel eventually resumed, and Zero Time Dilemma was released in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} two ToeJam & Earl {{games were}} a key Sega Genesis franchise, but {{development of a}} third game was prevented by the poor North American commercial performance of the console's successor, the Sega Saturn. Versions of ToeJam & Earl III developed at different times for the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast were canceled, but the latter was completed for the Xbox. On release, the game met with poor sales and mixed reviews; while certain critics found its gameplay innovative, its humor, soundtrack and graphics were variously praised and derided. <b>Opinions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's overall enjoyability and longevity were also mixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{eventually}} built as planned, and opened to traffic in 1999, but the increased costs involved in management and policing of protesters raised {{the profile of}} such campaigns in the United Kingdom, and contributed to several road schemes being cancelled or reviewed {{later on in the}} decade.
