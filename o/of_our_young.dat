On 4 August, McEntee announced the make-up of the committee, to be chaired by herself, which would include people from professions such as politics, health, mental health, charities, and sport. She also announced {{the establishment of a}} Young Persons’ Reference Group, co-chaired by singer Niall Breslin and mental health adviser Emma Farrell. Speaking about the initiative, McEntee said that its work would [...] "ensure that the voices <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> people are at the core of a more open, more engaging, more supportive national conversation about mental health and wellbeing". The National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health had its inaugural meeting in September.|$|E

[...] The Cleveland Gazette, an African-American weekly newspaper, described the circumstances as follows:Steubenville, like many other places, is suffering now from the roller skate craze. [...] There are now three in full blast and prospects for more. [...] Discrimination on account of color never was carried on in Steubenville until these strangers starting rinks here issued the edict [...] "No Negroes need apply except for positions of menials." [...] On the 16th there was an opening night at the South Side Rink, and two <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> men of gentlemanly deportment and honest reputation applied for admission.

He left Harriers in February 2013 to concentrate on scouting for Premier League club Norwich City, a role he had been involved with for some months on a part-time basis. He replaced Gary Holt, who departed to manage Falkirk, as Professional Development Phase Coach at Norwich City's academy, and was subsequently appointed as the U18s Academy Team Manager. He parted company with the club in July 2015 and soon took up the post of Academy U18 head coach at Wolverhampton Wanderers. He left his post with Wolves in March 2017.|$|E

500|$|The oldest {{inclusions}} {{found in}} meteorites, thought {{to trace the}} first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition {{of the age of}} the Solar System. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae occurred near the Sun while it was forming. A shock wave from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse. Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the Orion Nebula.Fe into the Protoplanetary Disk|author1=Martin Bizzarro |author2=David Ulfbeck |author3=Anne Trinquier |author4=Kristine Thrane |author5=James N.

The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly and all too quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be slammed shut once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again.

In his introductory speech at halftime of a January basketball game, against Michigan, he said [...] "I {{can assure you that}} you will be proud <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> people, in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the football field." [...] In his first year, Tressel registered the Buckeyes' first defeat of the Wolverines in Ann Arbor in 14 years, by a 26–20 score. Led by senior running back Jonathan Wells, the Buckeyes raced to a 23–0 halftime lead. With Wells out, Michigan mounted a second half comeback that fell just short. The next year, Tressel achieved what Cooper could not: Beating Michigan in consecutive years with a 14–9 victory. The game was decided on the last play when defensive back Will Allen intercepted a pass at the two yard line as time expired to clinch the victory. The Buckeyes were led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who ran for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also had a key reception to set up Maurice Hall's game-winning score. The Buckeyes {{went on to win the}} national championship that season, as they defeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E
