5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|In 851, the capable Muslim {{governor}} and general Abu'l-Aghlab Ibrahim died, {{and the local}} Muslims elected Abu'l-Aghlab al-Abbas ibn al-Fadl, the victor of Butera, as his successor. Without waiting for confirmation of his appointment from Ifriqiya, the new governor attacked and captured the northern fortress of Caltavuturo, and then turned south towards Enna, whose Byzantine commander refused to meet him in the field. Abbas continued his raid, and in 852–853 he devastated the Val di Noto. Butera was besieged for five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> until its inhabitants came to terms and secured his withdrawal by delivering 5,000–6,000 prisoners. Little details are known about {{the events of the}} next four years, but the picture painted by the sources is one of unopposed Muslim raids across the remaining Byzantine territories. Abbas captured several fortresses, including Cefalù in 857, whose population was allowed safe departure and which was then razed. Gagliano was also besieged, but not taken. In summer 858, the two sides were engaged in naval combat, probably off Apulia; Abbas' brother Ali managed to defeat the Byzantine fleet of 40 ships in the first engagement, but was in turn defeated and forced to flee in the second.|$|E

50|$|First, the Court {{seems to}} promote a very generous {{interpretation}} {{of the concept of}} worker under the article 45 TFEU. This is especially true considering Mr.Koupatantze’s situation, seeing that his total time of employment amounts to a mere month and a half, below the three <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> threshold usually formulated in specific regulations. This is said to blur the boundaries between worker and non-worker, and can lead to the question if previous periods of employment will hold out to be a relevant criterion at all towards the future.|$|R
25|$|A {{prohibition}} {{order on}} a book lasts {{for a period of}} twelve years. A first prohibition order on a periodical is for a period of three, six or twelve months, depending on how often it is published. A second or subsequent prohibition order on a periodical causes it to be permanently banned. A prohibition order can be appealed against by the author, editor or publisher of the book, the publisher of the periodical or by any five members of the Oireachtas. A person convicted of possessing prohibited publications is liable for a fine of €63.49 <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|For {{about four}} months after the {{opposition}} of Jupiter (from L to K in the diagram below), it is possible to view emergences of Io from its eclipses, while for {{about four months}} before the opposition (from F to G), it is possible to view immersions of Io into Jupiter's shadow. For about five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of the year, around the point of conjunction, it is impossible to observe the eclipses of Io at all because Jupiter is too close (in the sky) to the sun. Even during the periods before and after opposition, not all of the eclipses of Io can be observed from a given location on the Earth's surface: some eclipses will occur during the daytime for a given location, while other eclipses will occur while Jupiter is below the horizon (hidden by the Earth itself).|$|E
25|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{would take}} place gradually over 6 months (180 days) from the formal signature of the final agreement ('D-day').

The formal decommissioning of weapons would begin once {{all members of the}} FARC have reached the zones.

500|$|Gestation lasts {{five to six}} months, {{after which}} a single calf (or rarely twins) is born. Most births {{take place in the}} spring (October to November), prior to the onset of the rainy season. The infant weighs the female keeps her calf hidden in cover while she is away. Mother and calf rejoin the herd about three to four weeks after parturition; the young are weaned at five <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> When the mother gives birth again, the {{previous}} offspring, now 6 to 12 months old, deserts her to join herds of adult springbok. Thus, a female can calve twice a year, and even thrice if one calf dies. Springbok live for up to 10 years in the wild.|$|E

500|$|Khalid led {{an assault}} and conquered Damascus on 18 September 634 after a 30-day siege.

Abu Bakr died during the siege of Damascus and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid from his command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah the new commander in chief of Islamic forces in Syria. Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalid's dismissal during the siege, but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered.|$|E
