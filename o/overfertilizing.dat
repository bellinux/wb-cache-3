30|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{is accompanied}} by, no doubt, {{an abuse of}} agrochemical inputs and a reckless pumping of groundwater, which are becoming less and less abundant and of poor quality. This leads to a problem of <b>overfertilizing.</b> A number of field observations clearly show an excessive enrichment. Overexploitation of these resources, coupled with the phenomenon of drought, inevitably leads to degradation of soils and waters, which result in problems of salinization, sodization and deterioration of soil structure. The salinization of Sebkha Oran basin, as for most soils of the Maghreb, is initially of primary origin. The soils are in fact made of alluvial materials, more or less salty, resulting from {{the erosion of the}} reliefs and the alteration of the rocks. Soil salinization in these regions is related not only to climatic conditions but also to the often poorly controlled use of irrigation, which results in an accumulation of dissolved salts on the surface (Rahmoune et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} mineral {{that needs to be}} supplied in sufficient quantities for maintenance and growth and milk production in dairy cattle. However, over 60 % of the P consumed can be excreted in faeces with a potential to cause environmental pollution. Concern over higher levels of P in intensively managed livestock systems has led to legislation such as the Water Framework Directive in the European Union. In this manuscript, several methods of reducing P pollution are discussed. A major source of environmental P pollution has been overfeeding P mainly due to addition of ‘safety margin’ over the animal’s requirement and concerns related to fertility. Matching the animal’s requirement and feeding in groups so that animals at the same physiological status are fed according to their requirement has a potential to reduce P excretion significantly. P can also be reduced by matching available P with the metabolizable energy content of the diet because more P can be incorporated into milk when P is utilized by rumen microbes, which are limited by energy. Plants contain phytate bound P that need to be broken up before they can be absorbed by the animal. Although ruminants can digest phytate, use of phytase enzyme could help either directly by acting on phytate P or improvement of feed digestibility. Pasture management can lead to improved nutrient cycling, particularly if the soil is deficient in P. However, <b>overfertilizing</b> pasture could result is higher runoff of dissolved reactive P. Management practices that leave adequate forage residue on the surface such as rotational grazing will improve infiltration and decrease runoff, reducing nutrient losses...|$|E
50|$|In 1969, the {{fertilization}} experiment {{began with}} Lake 227, and in 1973, the double-basin eutrophication experiment on Lake 226 began, {{in which a}} section of the Lake 226S was <b>overfertilized</b> with carbon and nitrogen and the other section 226N with carbon and nitrogen as well as phosphorus. The iconic image of the green eutrophied section 226N has been described as the most important in the history of limnology. It convinced the public and policy-makers that phosphorus levels needed to be controlled.|$|R
40|$|Eutrophication (the overenrichment {{of aquatic}} {{ecosystems}} with nutrients leading to algal blooms and anoxic events) is a persistent condition of surface waters and a widespread environmental problem. Some lakes have recovered after sources of nutrients were reduced. In others, recycling of phosphorus from sediments enriched {{by years of}} high nutrient inputs causes lakes to remain eutrophic even after external inputs of phosphorus are decreased. Slow flux of phosphorus from <b>overfertilized</b> soils {{may be even more}} important for maintaining eutrophication of lakes in agricultural regions. This type of eutrophication is not reversible unless there are substantial changes in soil management. Technologies for rapidly reducing phosphorus content of overenriched soils, or reducing erosion rates, are needed to improve water quality...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} cultivars of Capsicum annuum, the friggitello {{requires}} a warm climate {{with a lot}} of sunlight and is not tolerant of frost. The seeds take 10 to 14 days to germinate, after which the plant will reach maturity in 70 to 80 days. It appreciates slightly rich and well-drained soils, but <b>overfertilized</b> soil will result in fewer fruits. The plant has the potential to grow plenty of fruits, so it requires staking {{if it is to be}} prevented from falling over due to the weight of the fruits. The fruits should be harvested when they are 5 - 7.5 cm long. Mature fruits will eventually turn red, but it is best to pick them while they are still green.|$|R
40|$|Characterization of Phosphorus (P) in soils is {{important}} both agronomically and environmentally, although the outcome {{may depend on}} the technique applied. Phosphorus desorption from <b>overfertilized</b> soils is significant for agriculture and the environmental pollution in northern Iran as in the world. Different P fractions viz. total, organic, inorganic (easily soluble P, Fe-P, Al-P, Ca-P and occluded P), PW (water extractable) and NH 4 -lactate extractable P (PAL) varied widely among the soils studied, indicating a wide variability of P supplying capacity of these soils. Soluble P was positively correlated to Ca-P (r = 0. 7; pW (r = 0. 68; po (r = 0. 67; pAL was highly correlated with PW (r = 0. 82; pAL and the lowest content of Fe, Al, silt and clay among all the soils studied.

40|$|The paper {{states the}} regularities of the within-field {{variation}} of soil fertility which {{are important for}} variable rate fertilizer application under conditions of precision agrotechnologies including the technologies which limit the agroeconomic efficiency. As it is well known, the usual (traditional) fertilizer practice stipulates their application taking into account average indices of soil fertility: mobile plant food elements (N, P, K etc.) content in the plow layer. At the same time, {{one part of the}} plants gets excess of mineral nutrition, and the other part – its deficiency. That results in shortage of agricultural products, their deterioration and also the pollution of the environment and the soil with the excesses of agrochemicals in <b>overfertilized</b> plots. In the last decades traditional technologies give place to high-precision agrotechnologies with differentiated fertilizer application taking into account within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility. There are several constraints for widespread adoption of high-precision agrotechnologies including the underestimation of the character of within-field variability of soil quality. Our investigations reveal eight regularities of the within-field variation of agrochemical indices, which characterize soil fertility in arable soils. These regularities would allow to more seriously estimate the efficiency of variable rate fertilizer application under conditions of precision agrotechnologies...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaPhosphorus {{continuous}} {{application in}} fertilizers, in quantities superior to those required by plants causes a P buildup in soils, potentially increasing nutrient losses and compromising water quality by eutrophication process. This work {{was aimed at}} assessing the effect of DRW cycles, in two soils with different fertilization histories subjected to organic and mineral fertilization, over P availability. Soils were collected from a long-term fertilizer management platform (NW Italy) divided in two plots experiencing since 1996 different fertilization management (one plot fertilized with low N and K levels and no P and another with fertilization high on N and P levels), and each was divided in 3 subplots treated with mineral, compost and without fertilization, since 2010. The soils were subjected, under laboratory conditions, to four DRW cycles and compared with another set at constant moisture. Weekly the soils were sampled and analyzed for some of their P forms. Soluble P increased in compost fertilized soil, especially after the third dry and rewet cycle, following microbial decay. Yet, this was more pronounced in the <b>overfertilized</b> soils. From these findings {{it is possible to}} conclude that the availability of P may be further enhanced by water content variations as by compost addition...|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1080 / 00103624. 2010. 508296 The soil {{phosphorus}} (P) test in Portugal {{is based}} on extraction with ammonium lactate (AL) at acidic pH. Because this test is rarely used in other countries, it is desirable {{to see whether the}} AL-P values correlate with the more commonly used P tests. In this work, we compared AL-P with bicarbonate-extractable P (Olsen’s method) for a group of 48 samples from Portuguese acidic soils differing widely in P status. Despite their contrasting composition, both reagents extracted phosphate from the same sources, albeit in different proportions. Both Olsen P and AL-P were strongly correlated with resin-extractable and dilute electrolyte-desorbable P, which are respectively related to the soil contents in phytoavailable P and P that can be released to runoff or drainage water. Olsen P and AL-P were strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 870), the correlation became stronger when three <b>overfertilized</b> soils were excluded (Olsen P = 2. 35 + 0. 45 AL-P; R 2 = 0. 908; P ≤ 0. 001, n = 45). No correlation was observed for a group of soils recently fertilized with Gafsa phosphate probably because the acidic AL reagent dissolved residual calcium phosphate, thus overestimating the soil content in desorbable P. On the basis of the present results and the AL-P-based fertility classes used for fertilizer recommendation purposes, Olsen P–based fertility classes were tentatively proposed for Portuguese acidic soils...|$|R
40|$|Cereal-legume {{intercropping}} {{systems may}} show improved agronomic and environmental performance over sole crops {{depending on the}} intercrop management. This study aimed at investigating the effect of sowing and fertilizer management {{on the performance of}} a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) -wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercrop. A 2 -yr experiment was performed in Grignon, France. Intercrop management strategies varied in sowing proportion relative to the sowing density of sole crops (50 : 50, 66 : 33, and 50 : 70 for pea and wheat, respectively) and N fertilization (without N fertilization, conventionally fertilized, and <b>overfertilized</b> at different dates). Conventionally managed sole wheat and sole pea were used as controls. The total grain yield, wheat yield proportion at harvest, yield components, N efficiency, grain protein concentration, residual soil mineral N aft er harvest, and land equivalent ratios (LER) were compared. The fertilized 50 : 50 intercrop was a good compromise between production (yields and wheat protein concentration), N efficiency, and limited residual soil N. The unfertilized 50 : 50 intercrop had the lowest grain yields and wheat protein concentration. An early overfertilization increased the proportion of wheat yield at harvest, whereas a late overfertilization increased the wheat grain protein concentration. Increasing the proportion of pea at sowing was a good way to produce more pea yield. Increasing the sown wheat proportion with N fertilization led to a higher proportion of wheat yield at harvest but did not improve the wheat grain protein concentration. These results indicate that agronomic management markedly impacts intercrop performance, and management practices can be adjusted to meet farmers' production targets...|$|R
40|$|The saying "If some is good, more {{is better}} " is not {{necessarily}} a beneficial approach to fertilizing orchids. Plants will only absorb the amount of mineral nutrients they need, which is determined in part by the amount of light they receive, the temperatures they are grown in and the quantity of water available. Just as with people, too much food can cause serious health problems in orchids — excess mineral salts can build up, which they cannot tolerate. It is a gradual problem, affecting orchids that have been consistently <b>overfertilized</b> or have gone too long without repotting, allowing mineral salts to accumulate and concentrate over time. Fertilizing If you grow a mixed collection, one in which a variety of genera are represented, the fertilizing needs of your plants may vary considerably. The general rule of thumb — applying a balanced fertilizer weekly, weakly — is a good starting point. Too much or too strong fertilizer can burn orchid leaves and roots. Many growers recommend that plants be watered with plain water, then watered a second time with a fertilizer solution. This ensures that the medium is thoroughly wet before fertilizer is applied. Some mixes, especially those containing pine bark, can be difficult to wet through, and so should be prewatered with plain water and left to sit a few minutes until the medium is completely damp. This helps reduce salt buildup and the possibility of root burn. Most vandaceous orchids do best with copious amounts of fertilizer, and during growth may benefit from dilut...|$|R
40|$|The {{program of}} the Conference {{included}} an introduction and overview of the {{program of the}} Inland Lake Demonstration and Shoreland Management Project of Wisconsin. Reports were presented on selected lake renewal activities, selected shoreland management and development activities, and shoreland management educational programs. Projects were described involving chemical and inactivation of nutrients, nutrient exclusion/diluational pumping, rehabilitation of a small flowage, urban runoff, characterization private controls for recreational and development, shoreland development, and lake rehabilitation legislation and programs. The progress of Minnesota’s shoreland program and activities in lake demonstration projects was described. Alum was used successfully for chemical inactivation of nutrients in an <b>overfertilized</b> small lake in Wisconsin. Dilutional pumping resulted in more success in reducing the phosphorus content of another lake. Plastic sheeting, in combination with sand and gravel blankets on the bed of a millpond, was used to control aquatic plants. With regard to water-oriented recreational developments, {{it was suggested that}} an automatic property owners association can provide a mechanism for maintaining and managing the common open space and facilities to which individual lake lot owners have common rights. A nationwide survey disclosed that explicit statutes saying that a local unit of government or State agency is authorized to project, manage, or rehabilitate lakes are rare.

40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility {{of three different}} fertilizer management strategies (constant rate, three-rate and multiple-rate technology) {{in the application of}} nitrogen fertilizer to corn are compared under different probability distributions for field fertility. A constant rate was more profitable than either variable-rate technology system for homogeneous fields with low fertility. The ap-plication area at which the relative profitability between systems changed was largely determined by the characteristics of the fertility distribution rather than by assumptions regarding costs. Variable-rate technology improves groundwater quality in low-fertility fields by reducing total fertilizer applied and in high-fertility fields by increasing corn yield. Key words: fertility distributions, net returns, precision farming, variable rate. Spatial information technology such as global positioning systems is rapidly being applied in agriculture. Known as precision agricul-ture, site-specific farming, or variable-rate technology, this technology collects and an-alyzes data for alternative locations, thereby permitting management decisions to vary by location. The technology recognizes the spa-tial variability inherent in most agricultural production processes. For example, in crop production, soil fertility can vary significantly within a field so that the typical nutrient man-agement strategy of applying a single rate of fertilizer will result in areas that are either under- or <b>overfertilized.</b> Variable-rate tech-nology allows farmers to apply the optimal rate for each location in the field, thereby im-proving efficiency in fertilizer use and poten-tially significantly decreasing residual nutrient loadings. The question surrounding whether the po-tential increase in gross returns and reduction in fertilizer expenses is sufficient to cover the investment costs of adopting variable-rate technology (VRT) remains unanswered.

40|$|Recent {{studies at}} {{watershed}} scale {{indicate that the}} excessive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in irrigated maize {{is one of the}} major contributors to non-point nitrate pollution of waters in some agricultural areas of Spain. There is a need to provide relatively easy and practical decision tools to help farmers to increase N use efficiency in maize fields which simultaneously will increase crop profits and reduce environmental problems from excessive N use. Four field trials with different soil types were conducted in three different locations in Spain during the years 2010 and 2011 to compare three N fertilizer managements. These were (T 1) a fixed N rate considering the crop potential of the zone, 200 - 250 kg N/ha, (T 2) a variable rate of N depending on mineral soil N content before plant sowing, (T 3) a variable rate of N depending of chlorophyll meter reading (CMR) at V 15 stage. A control (T 0) treatment without N application and an over fertilized treatment (T 4) of 300 kg N/ha were also included. These five treatments were evaluated under 3 different initial soil nitrate concentrations (low, medium, and high), prior to sowing. Total N-fertilizer applied, grain yield and N-fertilizer use efficiency (NUEf) are presented and discussed. Our results showed that the two decision tools evaluated (T 2 and T 3) allowed for a reduction in total N fertilizer applied in two of the four experimental sites compared to the fixed N rate (T 1) without yield penalties. In the other two sites the T 3 treatment reduced the N applied but the soil criteria (T 2) did not allow to reduce the N applications. The NUEf of the <b>overfertilized</b> plots (T 4) was, i...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture in the Central Andes of Peru is {{performed}} mostly by small farmers in mixed crop-animal production systems. Farmers are usually organized in collaborative social structures named Farm communities, in which complex mechanisms {{for access to}} land, labor and inputs can be found. Although the region is not unknown for Peruvian and International research institutions, {{most of the research}} in the past has focused on social aspects of the production systems or on specific physical and biological topics (climate, soils, biodiversity), with limited integration to the existing social structures. This work aims to develop a holistic view of the farming systems in four farm communities in the Mantaro Valley (Central Andes of Peru) by investigating all biophysical inputs and outputs at the field level on quantitative scales, and providing information for future implementation of strategies to increase the farm technical sustainability. The present work was developed from 2004 to 2008, in the research sites of Colpar, Quilcas, Aramachay, Sincos, Molinos and Quero. The experimental data were collected using participatory research methodologies and structured interviews of farmers combined with farm visits and intensive measurement of selected pilot-plots. The climate during the experimental period was measured through semi-automated weather stations. The crop cycles managed in 38 plots along three crop seasons were categorized in terms of use of organic and inorganic nutrient inputs. The inorganic fertilizers used were measured and the organic matter sources were chemically characterized. With these data, the production of biomass and the inputs and removals of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were measured, and nutrient balances were calculated. The use of labor, animal traction and machinery were measured per plot. The amount of animals raised per farm was recorded {{at the beginning of the}} study. Biomass production and C- and N-balances were further calculated for the main rotations identified, and data were integrated at the farm level for selected families in Colpar, Quilcas and Aramachay. The precipitation in Mantaro Valley is concentrated in a well-defined rainy season extending from October to March. The dry season is colder, but the diurnal variation of temperature is much wider than the yearly variation. The major climatic risks during the crop season are the occurrence of drought periods and frosts. The risk of frosts is highest in Aramachay, resulting in the replacement of corn by barley in the crop rotations. The overall climate is adequate for annual crops, but without irrigation to overcome the dry season it is impossible to establish permanent crops. Two main groups of soils were indentified in the studied zones: soils located on hillsides, which are fine-textured, moderately fertile, high in organic matter and acidic; and soils located on the valley floor, which are coarse-textured, chemically fertile, low in organic matter and of neutral to alkaline pH. The unfavorable chemical properties in the soils identified can be remediated with regular soil management practices. Soil fertility can be increased through the application of organic matter and rational use of inorganic fertilizers. Phosphorus and potassium deficiencies did not seem to be critical. As strongly acidic soils are common, liming could result in increased yields for barley and legumes. In general terms, soil chemical properties are not strong limiting factors for the production systems. Crops included potatoes, cereals, corn, grain legumes and native tubers. Potatoes received the highest amounts of external inputs (organic and inorganic) but yields obtained varied widely in relation to the inputs applied. In general, the C- balances were variable and the N-, P- and K-balances were positive, indicating that, in certain cases, potato plots were <b>overfertilized.</b> Barley and wheat were cultivated with fewer inputs compared to potato, while corn and faba bean fertilization consisted mainly of farmyard manures. C-balances in cereals and corn were strongly negative, and nutrient-balances depended on the amount of fertilizers applied. C- and nutrient-balances were positive for faba bean. Crop production systems in Colpar are oriented to organic matter use while in Molinos production is based on inorganic fertilizers. Quilcas, Aramachay and Sincos have mixed-input systems. Livestock included cows, oxen, sheep, donkeys, guinea pigs and poultry. Animals are fed with natural pastures during the rainy season and with fodder and crop residues during the dry season. Crops fertilization depends on farmyard manures, thus crop production is strongly related to animals. Most of the farmers prepare farmyard manure according to one traditional procedure. Manure accumulates during the dry season, when most of the animals stay in the stable. In all the zones, land is split in small units to diversify cropping and diminishing climatic risks. The plots are usually larger in the flat areas. The availability of land per farm is markedly lower in Colpar and Quilcas compared with other zones. Human labor, especially obtained from family members, is the main source of energy for crop cultivating activities. Exchanged labor was more frequently observed in Colpar and Quilcas and contracted manpower was used more in Molinos. Both male and female laborers had the same importance for crop management, although they could be divided according to specific activities. Animal traction was used extensively for soil preparation and transport, especially in high altitude zones. The use of machinery was limited to low and flat areas where plots were larger and accessible. Crop production in Colpar was totally dependent on human and animal labor, while Molinos used more machinery. Monocultures of cereals or corn and rotations with potato were negative in C-balances, but the N-balances were positive. The inclusion of faba bean in the rotation resulted in positive C- and N-balances. Fallow periods could restore C and N in the system,but their contribution was lower than that for legumes. Partial transfer of inputs from potato to barley and replacement of fallows with grain or forage legumes are proposed as strategies for increasing sustainability of rotations. At the farm level, C-balances in Aramachay and Quilcas were negative and N-balances were positive, while in Colpar, both were positive. The production per farm indicated a higher capacity of farmers in Aramachay to orientate towards markets, compared with Colpar and Quilcas. This may indicate more poverty in the last zones. Soil liming and inorganic fertilization increased grain yield of barley, indicating that transferring fertilizers from potato could result in a better use of nutrients within the rotations in farm communities in the Mantaro Valley. status: publishe...|$|R
