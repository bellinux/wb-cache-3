A tree is an [...] "in" [...] tree if the <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> of the tree overlaps the bole as viewed without the prism (Figure 1). A tree where the <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> of the trunk is perfectly aligned with the original bole is a borderline tree (Figure 2) and DBH must be measured to determine if it should be counted (or, more commonly in practice, every other borderline tree is counted). A tree where the <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> of the tree does not overlap or touch the original bole is an [...] "out" [...] tree (Figure 3) and is not counted.|$|R

40|$|Reflection {{amplitude}} as {{a function}} of offset is effective in characterizing lithology in oil produc-ing basins. Experience shows that AVO inversion methods based on amplitude-preserved prestack migration typically provides a more accurate lithology estimation than NMO-based AVO analysis. However, some artifacts may be introduced into the migration section, which can obscure the es-timate of reservoir properties. In this paper, I investigate the impact of migration deconvolution (MD) on AVO inversion. The MD method is applied to the images migrated from common <b>offset</b> <b>sections</b> in order to suppress the unwanted migration artifacts. Together with angle gathers, the AVO parameters are inverted using MD common reflection gathers. Results with synthetic data clearly demonstrate that migration deconvolution noticeably improves the quality of the migrated common <b>offset</b> <b>section.</b> A field marine data example indicates that MD produces the improvement in the migration imaging quality and produce a section optimized for interpretation and anomaly identification...|$|R

40|$|Multiples {{often occur}} in marine seismic data, but actually, they also {{occur in the}} far <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> of land seismic in that {{multiple}} reduction in land seismic data using CDP gather resulted from conventional method {{can be applied to}} acquire omitted multiple model. There are many methods to reduce the appearance of long period multiples, yet to remove multiples from primary signals is challenging. Compared to other methods, high-resolution Radon demultiple (RAMUR) is a method which uses Radon transform to predict multiples using domain tau-p to model multiples. RAMUR processing has more advantages in identifying reflection events, both in primary signals and multiples, to produce good stack sections. In this research, CDP gather resulted from conventional method was used as input in multiple modeling. Besides, adaptive subtraction process also apply CDP gather as input data to be subtracted with multiple model to preserve the data. The result shows that high-resolution Radon demultiple (RAMUR) method is able to reduce long period multiples in far <b>offset</b> <b>section</b> using DTCUT 120 parameter in land seismic effectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} {{the solution of}} visualization technology in virtual spinal fixation surgery system, which implemented the 2 D image display and 3 D bone tissue refactoring. It is designed based on Visualization Toolkit and implemented by the improved RayCasting volume rendering algorithm. First, design the uniform interface for 2 D and 3 D visualization, and then give 2 D slicing visualization pipeline and spine 3 D refactoring pipeline. In spine 3 D refactoring, the system dynamically chose appropriate rendering algorithm to satisfy the real-time requirement of the system interaction based on GPU or CPU computer hardware environment. Meanwhile, provide visualization windows with visualization pipeline adjustment panel to adjust visualization effect conviniently. By 2 D slicing data visualization we can transform CT value into 2 D grayscale image and display it. The refactoring algorithm of 3 D bone tissue refactors CT visualization data into 3 D bone model. By defining the resampling coordinates in 3 D refactoring window, the system provides re-slicing of axial <b>section</b> <b>view,</b> sagittal <b>section</b> <b>view</b> and coronary <b>section</b> <b>view...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the case}} of roads or other linear infrastructure, a chainage (derived from Gunter's Chain - 1 chain is equal to 66 feet or 100 links) will be established, often to {{correspond}} with the centre line of the road or pipeline. During construction, structures would then be located in terms of chainage, offset and elevation. Offset {{is said to be}} [...] "left" [...] or [...] "right" [...] relative to someone standing on the chainage line who is looking in the direction of increasing chainage. Plans would often show plan views (viewed from above), profile views (a [...] "transparent" [...] <b>section</b> <b>view</b> collapsing all <b>section</b> <b>views</b> of the road parallel to the chainage) or cross-section views (a [...] "true" [...] <b>section</b> <b>view</b> perpendicular to the chainage). In a plan view, chainage generally increases from left to right, or from the bottom {{to the top of the}} plan. Profiles are shown with the chainage increasing from left to right, and cross-sections are shown as if the viewer is looking in the direction of increasing chainage (so that the [...] "left" [...] offset is to the left and the [...] "right" [...] offset is to the right).|$|R
