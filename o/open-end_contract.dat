40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} tax credit policy as an {{instrument}} to foster hiring with open-end rather than with fixed-term contracts. In particular, we examine a specific regulation adopted in Italy in the year 2000 (Credito d’Imposta). This policy offers a generous and automatic tax credit to all firms hiring workers with open-end contracts. The eligibility criteria are very mild for both firms and workers. Our results seem to indicate, both formally and empirically, that firms used this subsidy to hire under open-end contracts primarily those workers {{who would have been}} hired under such a contract regardless the subsidy, even though after a short transition into temporary employment. Our estimates suggest that, compared to 2000, in 2001 the subsidy did not increase the overall probability to be hired, but changed the composition of new employees. It increased the chances to find an <b>open-end</b> <b>contract</b> but in a rather uneven way across workers. Conditional on being hired, the probability rose by about 10 per cent for workers holding a college degree, by about 4 per cent for people with a high school diploma, while did no...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, {{inequality}} {{has been on}} the rise in a number of OECD countries. One of the main causes of economic inequality, in Italy as in many other European countries, is rooted in the segmentation of the labour market. The Italian labour market is currently described as deeply segmented between an insider ad an outsider market. In the Italian manufacturing sector the quota of stable workers has declined through time and the number of unstable workers, low qualified and low paid, has increased and represents a non-marginal quota of total employment. Frequently a young worker experiments a succession of temporary contracts {{at the beginning of his}} career and develop into a more permanent position But temporary workers have, several times, a different destiny: the situation of precariousness extends to the workers’ entire career and are to be considered as an extreme case of outsiders, who operate in bad working conditions and receive low wages compared to workers hired with an <b>open-end</b> <b>contract.</b> In this research workers in manufacturing are divided between movers and stayers. Both categories show signs of instability. The quota of tenure workers over total workers decreases and movers increase through time in a significant way. Among these are permanent movers whose work histories, fragmented and chaotic, are identified and are compared with those of workers having more stable careers. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{fixed-term}} contracts {{have been widely used}} to ease the regulatory burden in several European labour markets. Because there is some concern that they might be a dead-end for many worker, policy makers have intervened to increase transitions from fixed-term to <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts.</b> The effects of these interventions have not been thoroughly studied. This paper is a contribution to fill the gap. We look at a recent Italian policy designed to foster hiring with open-end rather than with fixed-term contracts. Our results seem to indicate that most of the financial support was wasted because of the large dead-weight loss associated to the program.

40|$|A long-standing {{economic}} tradition {{maintains that}} labour supply reacts to market tightness; its sensitivity to job quality has received less attention. If firms hire workers with both temporary and <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts,</b> does participation increase when more permanent jobs are available? We investigate this relationship within a policy evaluation framework; in particular, we examine how labour supply reacted in Italy {{to a recent}} subsidy in favour of <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts.</b> This subsidy increased labour force participation by 1. 4 % in 2001 and 2. 1 % in 2002. This increase was concentrated on males aged 35 - 54, with a low or at most a secondary schooling level, and {{might be due to}} the choice to leave undegraound economy. labour supply, program evaluation, temporary <b>contracts,</b> <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts,</b> shadow economy...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of a flexible labour force might influence adjustment decisions regarding the rigid part of the labour force. To test this idea, we contrast the use of trainees (fixed-term contracts) and normal-contract workers (<b>open-end</b> <b>contracts)</b> when a reform made it more costly to use trainees. The results of our DID analysis indicate that the burden of adjustment shifts on trainees if they {{are present in the}} firm; if this buffer becomes less available, firms employing trainees see their average labour productivity decrease in the short run and their job destruction increase in the medium run. These effects seem to be increasing with firm size. fixed term contracts, difference in differences analysis, labour demand, job creation, firing costs. ...|$|R
3000|$|Nevertheless, for {{a rising}} number of people, {{this leads to}} {{precarious}} working and living situations, and studies show that workers in atypical work situations face {{a higher risk of}} precarious working and living conditions [40]. The great increase in part-time jobs underlines these assertions. Compared to 1998, when 16  % of all employees were part-timers, almost a quarter of the work force is currently part-time employed in Austria. <b>Open-end</b> <b>contracts</b> are still in the majority, but the number of non-permanent contracts is constantly growing [29].

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{contribute}} to the literature by analyzing results relative to an Italian scheme, based on a December 5, 2012 decree, that subsidized conversions from fixed-term to <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts.</b> The policy {{did not apply to}} all groups of workers as it excluded men over 30. Furthermore, the funds were limited; as a matter of fact, they were exhausted in a couple of weeks. We elaborate on these features of the scheme and evaluate its effects through a diff-in-diffs strategy, which compares eligible workers with their non-eligible counterparts (older males) over very short periods of time. This strategy allows us to estimate the intention to treat effect (ITT) of the policy, which captures how the change in incentives altered the rate of conversion for eligible contracts during the period in which the subsidy was available.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of the more {{stringent}} employment protection legislation (EPL) that applies in Italy to firms with over 15 employees. We consider firms' propensity to grow when close to that threshold and changes in employment policies when they pass it. Using a comprehensive matched employer-employees dataset, we find that the probability of firms' growth is reduced by around 2 percentage points near the threshold. Using the stochastic transition matrix for firm size, we compute the long-run effects of EPL on the size distribution, finding that they are quantitatively modest. We also find that, contrary to the implications of more stringent firing restrictions, workers in firms just above the threshold have on average less stable employment relations than those just below it. We document that this is because firms above the threshold make greater use of flexible employment contracts, arguably to circumvent the stricter regulation on <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts.</b> employment policies; firing costs; firm size distribution; matched data...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{young people and}} their paths towards {{occupational}} stability in Italy, which may include non-standard work contracts. Besides {{a review of the}} literature on the topic, outcomes will be offered of a qualitative research on the career paths of forty youths who got <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts</b> in the private service sector. In the theoretical part, after a definition of atypical work and an esteem of the width of this social phenomenon, we shall deal with different sociological analysis of young people’s career paths, currently exposed to the risk of a precarious professional and social condition. The same aspects will be discussed in the empirical research. Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews, we are set to find out whether atypical work, which at the very beginning of a career can be can be considered even as a “goal”, becomes an effective gateway to stable and guaranteed jobs (hypothesis of the “jumping board”) or an obstacle (hypothesis of the “trap”). The paper aims also to understand which economic, cultural, and relational resources can become relevant for a successful transition from precarious to permanent employment...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s {{fixed-term}} contracts {{have been}} used in many European countries to reduce firing costs. As this strategy may have led to segmented labour markets, recent policy interventions have enhanced permanent jobs by cutting their labour costs. Efficient design of these policies requires knowledge of the costs associated with employment protection legislation. In this paper we evaluate these costs by measuring firmsÂ’ willingness to trade fixed-term for open-ended contracts in exchange for a cut in the labour cost of permanent jobs. Our results are based on a panel of Italian firms in the engineering sector whose labour costs were reduced by a tax credit granted to firms hiring workers on open-ended rather than fixed-term contracts. The trade-off is identified by comparing how the composition of recruitment by type of contract changed for firms that received the tax credit and those that did not. Potential distortions due to self-selection into the programme, firm-specific timevarying shocks or mechanical correlation induced by the selection rule into the programme, are accounted for by estimating the spurious effect of the tax credit in the years when it was not in force. Estimation is carried out in both a parametric and non-parametric setting that uses p-score to control for different probabilities of receiving the tax credit. We found that firms value the possibility of hiring one per cent new workers on a fixed-term contract as much as a cut in the labour cost of an open-ended worker in the range of 1. 3 - 2. 8 per cent. This result helps to explain recent employment growth in Italy, where the share of fixed-term contracts among new hires grew from 34 to 42 per cent between 1995 and 2003. Using our most conservative results, we evaluate that the labour cost reduction associated with this expansion amounted to anything between 10. 4 and 22. 4 per cent. Given the elasticity of employment to wages, the advent of flexibility in the Italian labour market can account for a large share, between 37 and 80 per cent, of employment growth in the private sector. tax credit, <b>open-end</b> <b>contracts,</b> fixed-term contracts, firing costs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe El Khomri law (also called " Work law ") has {{triggered}} {{a lot of}} conflicting judgements among French economists. However no model {{has been used to}} evaluate its effects ex ante. We have developed over the past 10 years a model of the recent French labor market, in order to analyze in detail this market and do policy design and analysis. The model integrates the heterogeneity of agents, and their decisions (firms and workers) based on "search theory", which gives rational microe-conomic foundations to behavior, albeit with decision rules using bounded rationality rather than optimal rules which cannot be computed in the complex system that the modeled labor market constitutes. We introduce many institutions and specially the two main labor <b>contracts,</b> <b>Open-Ended</b> <b>contracts</b> and Fixed Term Contracts. The WorkSim model simulates the gross flows between inactivity, unemployment and these two types of employment, with a consistent accounting system. It is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to set 63 parameters to fit more than 64 aggregate real variables. We analyze only the facilitation of the economic dismissals allowed by the El Khomri law but it is the most essential element of the law for the labor market. We find that it has little effect on global unemployment but benefits the young who crowd out the seniors. This result is based on the substitution by the employers of more precarious Open Ended Contracts to Fixed Duration Contracts which become useless, and the fact that young workers are more often in Fixed Duration Contracts than the other age categories. The labor market is deeply transformed. When aggregate demand is exogenously changed, the experiment shows that the employment and the unemployment react faster than before the law...|$|R

40|$|National audienceThe El Khomri law (also called " Work law ") has {{triggered}} {{a lot of}} conflicting judgements among French economists in 2016. However no model {{has been used to}} evaluate its effects ex ante. We have developed over the past 10 years a calibrated agent-based model of the French labor market, in order understand better such a complex system, and do policy analysis and design. The model integrates the hetero-geneity of agents, and their decisions (firms and workers) based on a search theoretical framework to generate gross flows. It gives rational microeconomic foundations to behavior, albeit with decision rules using bounded rationality rather than optimal rules in an equilibrium with rational expectations which would not make sense in such a complex system. Instead agents form anticipations based both on their own history and a detailed algorithm is developed to model the firms'computation of expected in-tertemporal profits for different scenarios of future own demand, with the possibility of loss aversion, to decide on hiring or not, and the type of labor contracts. We introduce several main institutions of the labor market and specially the two main labor <b>contracts,</b> <b>Open-Ended</b> <b>contracts</b> and Fixed Term Contracts. The WorkSim model simulates the gross flows between inactivity, unemployment and these two types of employment, with a consistent accounting system. It is calibrated by a powerful algorithm to set 63 parameters in order to fit 64 aggregate real variables. The calibration reveals an important loss aversion on part of firms, which is determinant of the hiring decisions. If we experiment with a low loss aversion, the unemployment diminishes by several points. We then analyze the facilitation of the economic dismissals allowed by the El Khomri law. We find that it has little effect on global unemployment but benefits the young who crowd out the seniors. This result is based on the substitution by the employers of Open Ended Contracts which become more precarious to Fixed Duration Contracts which become less useful, and the fact that young workers are more often in Fixed Term Contracts than the other age categories. The labor market is very deeply transformed in terms of flows also. When aggregate demand is endoge-nously changed, the experiment shows that the employment and the unemployment react more strongly than before the law, yielding a higher aggregate flexibility...|$|R

A question on the desirability of this "contrat de travail unique " (CTU) was included in the 2012 post-electoral survey. Using the answers to this question, this paper proposes an empirical analysis of the social base for the CTU. Insider/outsider theories would predict that insiders would oppose such a reform whereas outsiders would welcome it. Beyond the theoretical and empirical problems associated with the definition and identification of insiders and outsiders, the results of the estimations do not support this prediction.
