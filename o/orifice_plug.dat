40|$|Placement of orifice plugs {{has been}} {{suggested}} to augment the seal of conventional root canal fillings. This study assessed in vivo the efficacy of white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) plugs in preventing periapical inflammation subsequent to coronal inoculation of root-filled teeth. The two-rooted mandibular premolars of six beagle dogs were conventionally prepared and filled with gutta-percha and sealer. A white MTA <b>orifice</b> <b>plug</b> was placed into one canal in each tooth. Pulp chambers were inoculated with plaque except for 12 teeth (negative control), and restored. Radiographs were taken at regular intervals. At 10 months, dogs were killed and jaw blocks processed for histology. None of the roots revealed radiographic or histologic evidence of severe inflammation. Mild inflammation was observed in 17 % and 39 % of the roots with and without an <b>orifice</b> <b>plug,</b> respectively (McNemar, p > 0. 05). Without development of severe inflammation, the seal augmentation efficacy of MTA orifice plugs could not be determined. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{the exit}} {{temperature}} of the coolant from each fuel channel of the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility reactor is obtained by adjusting the coolant flow rate by a remotely operated variable orifice. Two variable orifices were designed and the hydraulic characteristics determined. Both orifice designs utilized a tapered plug {{moving in and out}} of a restricted flow passage at the upper end of the fuel channel. Data were obtained on pressure drop as a function of flow rate at different <b>orifice</b> <b>plug</b> positions; all measurements were made using water, and data were converted to equivalent values for sodium. Either type of orifice was capable of adjusting flow rate to match the power output of a fuel element at any location in the reactor core. The temperature sensitivity (change in exit temperature per unit change in <b>orifice</b> <b>plug</b> position) of the first type of orifice was low (lO deg F/in.) when used in combination with a central fuel element, and high (7 OO deg F/in.) when used with a peripheral element. The temperature sensitivity of the second type was more uniform (varying from 90 to 250 deg F/ in.). Consequently, the second type of orifice was selected for the HNPF. (auth...|$|E
40|$|A single, {{wide-range}} {{variable orifice}} design is developed, {{which provides a}} maximum orifice flow area of 2. 0 in. /sup 2 / and a minimum oriflce flow area of 0. 2 in. /sup 2 / The design {{is based on an}} overall operating core DELTA P of 4. 0 psi and provides for a sodium flow range of 2. 45 to 10. 0 lb/sec. Bypass leakage around the orifice is analyzed and accounted for in the design. It is shown that the use of piston rings is not necesary to reduce this leakage. The <b>orifice</b> <b>plug</b> profile is calculated for constant temperature sensitivity; the maximum average sensitivity being 451 deg F/ in. for a 1. 5 in. plug length. Fuel channel pressure drop is recalculated for both special and standard elements using the latest proposed designs. Maximum DELTA P including wide open variable orifice is 3. 6 psi. (auth...|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley 0. 3 -Meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel to {{study the effects of}} porous (sintered metal) <b>plug</b> <b>orifices</b> on orifice-induced static-pressure measurement error at high Reynolds numbers. A NACA airfoil was tested at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 0. 80 and at Reynolds numbers from 6 x 1, 000, 000 to 40 x 1, 000, 000. Data are included which compare pressure measurements obtained from porous <b>plug</b> <b>orifices</b> and from conventional orifices with diameters of 0. 025 cm (0. 010 in.) and 0. 102 cm (0. 040 in.). The two dimensional airfoil code GRUMFOIL was used to calculate boundary layer displacement thickness. The response time and the downstream effect of the porous <b>plug</b> <b>orifice</b> were considered in this investigation. The results showed that the porous <b>plug</b> <b>orifice</b> could be a viable method of reducing pressure error. The data also showed that the pressure measurements obtained with a 0. 102 -cm-diameter orifice were very close to the measurements obtained with 0. 025 -cm-diameter orifice over such of the airfoil and that downstream of a shock the orifice size was not critical...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Coronal microleakage is {{the major}} cause of failure of root canal treatments. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the sealing ability of white MTA, C&B Metabond and cavit against coronal microleakage of Enterococcus faecalis for four months. Methods and Materials: Ninety extracted single–rooted human teeth were selected. Root canal instrument-tation and abturation with gutta-percha was performed. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups of 20 teeth each, plus two control groups consisting of 5 teeth. Three millimeters of gutta-parcha was removed from the coronal aspect of the root canals in the groups I, II, III and replaced with C&B Metabond, cavit and white MTA, respectively. The teeth in group IV did not receive an intraorifice barrier. The external surface of each root, except the apical region, was covered with two layers of nail varnish. All teeth were inserted in the designed system for this experiment. The whole system was sterilized and then transferred in a BHI culture. A fresh solution of E. faecials was injected in to the system every 3 days. The samples were evaluated daily for 120 days and the time of culture contamination with E. faecalis was registered in each case. Statistical tests of Variance and Duncan were used to analyze the results. Results: All the samples in positive control group were infected after 24 hours. None of the negative control samples were infected after 120 days. Group I (C&B Metabond) and group II (cavit) had no significant difference with group III (White MTA). But groups I, II were significantly different from group IV (without barrier). Group III wasn’t significantly different with group IV. Conclusion: The obturated root canals that received a C&B Metabond or cavit <b>orifice</b> <b>plug</b> leaked significantly less than the obturated, unsealed group. Therefore, to prevent coronal microleakage this material can be recommended as a intraorifice barrier before restorative treatment is initiate...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} emitter (<b>orifice)</b> <b>plugging</b> {{inherent}} in drip irrigation systems was investigated. Plugging not only reduces {{the effectiveness of}} this most water conservative method but also excludes the use of low quality waters unless first processed with costly water treatment. A problem-solution approach was used to develop simple emitters and a network system that would minimize plugging to acceptable levels. Tests using secondary treated municipal effluent from the Mililani Wastewater Treatment Plant on Oahu, Hawaii, consisted of numerous plugging experiments supplemented by theoretical and laboratory studies. Tests showed that plugging, up to 25 % or less, can be controlled by using size emitters and passing the effluent through a stationary 40 - and 80 -mesh screen; critical-size emitters are 0. 03 in. for microjets and 0. 019 in. for monotubes; higher operating pressure further reduces plugging percentages; flexible 0. 15 in. slit orifices (at 15 psi) perform as well as the critical size rigid orifice but another round flexible orifice (rubber tube) was less successful; a multiple-inlet network design with critical-size emitters can minimize pressure and emitter flow variations along the drip laterals and was ideal for systems with large flow rates; and plugging was attributed to particles and fibers in the effluent.

50|$|Death customs {{among the}} Yapese focus on defilement {{of the living}} by {{proximity}} to the dead. After death in Yapese culture, the bodies are cleaned, rubbed with turmeric, and then the <b>orifices</b> are <b>plugged.</b> The next-of-kin stay with the body for three days. Around this time, the deceased's siblings and clan members exchange shell money. After the burial, the kinfolk stay near the gravesite and mourn for three days. They then continue mourning at temporary huts for almost a month. A special tamaarong performs a ritual during this time which is believed to send the deceased spirit to Gatsam.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{backflow}} region {{length in}} sudden-reduction oil tube {{is not only}} closely related with its energy loss, but also is closely related with the partition between <b>orifice</b> plate and <b>plug.</b> In this paper, the characteristics of backflow region length in sudden-reduction oil tube are researched. The results illustrate that backflow region length decreases {{with the increase of}} the contraction ratio; when Reynolds number is more than 105, Reynolds number have little impacts on backflow region length. Empirical expression about backflow region length in sudden-reduction oil tube is also put forward in this paper...|$|R

The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore. These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account <b>orifices</b> for spark <b>plugs</b> or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the [...] "dead space" [...] unavailable for valves.

40|$|A {{porous plug}} is {{provided}} for the reduction or elimination of positive error caused by the orifice during static pressure measurements of airfoils. The porous plug is press fitted into the orifice, thereby preventing the error caused either by fluid flow turning into the exposed orifice or by the fluid flow stagnating at the downstream edge of the orifice. In addition, the porous plug is made flush with the outer surface of the airfoil, by filing and polishing, to provide a smooth surface which alleviates the error caused by imperfections in the <b>orifice.</b> The porous <b>plug</b> is preferably made of sintered metal, which allows air {{to pass through the}} pores, so that the static pressure measurements can be made by remote transducers...|$|R
50|$|Perfume and {{perfumery}} also {{existed in}} Indus civilization (3300 BCE - 1300 BCE). One {{of the earliest}} distillation of Ittar was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita.According to a 1975 report, an archeologist named Dr Paolo Rovesti found a terra-cotta distillation apparatus in the Indus valley together with oil containers made of the same material, and carbon dating puts this at 3000 B.C., much earlier than we conventionally believe that distillation became practiced for the isolation of essential oils. We believe that terra cotta vessels with <b>plugged</b> <b>orifices</b> of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil.|$|R
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can actually}} be used to some slight advantage. If a compression test does give a low figure, {{and it has been}} determined it is not due to intake valve closure/camshaft characteristics, then one can differentiate between the cause being valve/seat seal issues and ring seal by squirting engine oil into the spark <b>plug</b> <b>orifice,</b> in a quantity sufficient to disperse across the piston crown and the circumference of the top ring land, and thereby affect the mentioned seal. If a second compression test is performed shortly thereafter, and the new reading is much higher, it would be the ring seal that is problematic, whereas if the compression test pressure observed remains low, it is a valve sealing (or more rarely head gasket, or breakthrough piston or, rarer still, cylinder-wall damage) issue.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of high Reynolds number facilities, {{such as the}} National Transonic Facility (NTF) and the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT), has stimulated interest again {{in the study of}} orifice induced static pressure. In a high Reynolds number facility, the orifice will have a much larger effect on the boundary layer than in a conventional wind tunnel. The present investigation was performed in the 0. 3 -m TCT at Mach numbers in the range from 0. 60 to 0. 80 and Reynolds numbers in the range from 6, 000, 000 to 40, 000, 000 with the objective to compare the porous <b>plug</b> <b>orifices</b> to conventional 0. 025 cm orifices in a high Reynolds number environment. It was found that there was an error at high Reynolds numbers which could not be neglected and that the use of a porous metal disk in a conventional orifice could virtually eliminate the orifice induced pressure error...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} acoustical characteristics, in particular, sound {{generation of}} intermittent flow regime in a horizontal pipe through an orifice, based on recorded pressure fluctuations and videos of {{upstream and downstream}} flow of the orifice. The flow regimes of interest are plug flow and slug flow, respectively, where sharp-edged and rounded entrance orifice are tested. In principle, the noise generated in the intermittent flow regime through an orifice increases with a higher gas flow rate. The pressure fluctuation spectra show a "haystack" configuration with a peak at a low frequency associated with a sequence of elongated gas bubbles. It demonstrates that the sound generation is predominately governed by dynamic of elongated gas bubbles in intermittent flow through the <b>orifice.</b> Particularly, in <b>plug</b> flow, an additional small hump is detected close to St = 0. 2, i. e., vortex-shedding at the orifice exit contributes the sound generation {{in addition to the}} bubble dynamic. Furthermore, non-dimensional power of the downstream intermittent flow decays with St-a. The value of a increases with a higher liquid rate, and the "haystack"-like shape at the peak frequency widens as the gas rate increases. In plug flow, the rounded entrance orifice generates less noise by resulting in a smaller pressure drop compared to the sharp-edged orifice in general; however, it generates noise in high frequency...|$|R
40|$|Two {{mathematical}} models describing {{one-dimensional flow}} from buried sources and in unsaturated soils were developed. One considered {{the consumption of}} water by roots. For the assumed distribution of the root consumption with time and depth, the 10 cm (4 -in.) deep source provided better water distribution than did 20 - and 30 -cm (8 - and 12 -in.) deep sources. Irrigation from zero depth, {{as in the case}} of trickle irrigation, appeared to be the best system for the given conditions. Plugging of emitters by particulate materials decreased as the cross-sectional area of the emitter opening was increased. Less than 0. 06 atm (1 psig) vacuum had little effect on the flow of emitters tested. Higher vacuum amounts caused the reopening of <b>plugged</b> <b>orifice</b> emitters, but caused plugging of labyrinth emitters. Vacuum-induced plugging of labyrinth emitters resulted from accumulation of silt and fine sand within the flow path. Operation at higher pressures caused limited flow recovery. A theory was proposed for determining pressure distributions in drip laterals where water is uniformly distributed along the lateral's length. The theory provided acceptable design in two tests. Computer-derived design curves were developed. Because 1000 or more emitters may be required for subirrigation of eachacre, emitters need to be both inexpensive and resistant to plugging. Four experimental emitters were designed and constructed. A modification of one microtube emitter is being produced commercially. Two moveable drip systems were proposed. Drip irrigation lines successfully trailed a center-pivot irrigation system. Also a tractor-mounted implement was developed for moving individual drip irrigation laterals...|$|R
