50|$|The {{study of}} modern {{languages}} {{did not become}} part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. <b>Oral</b> <b>work</b> was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the grammar-translation method.|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} of instruction depends on the program; while the civil law program is instructed entirely in French, the common law program is available in either English or French, with students permitted to take classes in both languages if they wish. In compliance with university policy, all written work may be submitted in either language, {{with the exception of}} the French common law program, in which all written and <b>oral</b> <b>work</b> must be submitted in French.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{curriculum}} {{made up of}} Moral Education, English, Nepali, Mathematics, science, Environmental Science, Social Studies, Art & Craft and Computer Studies {{is taught}} in all the other classes. Pre-school consists of two levels: Prep I and Prep II. The minimum age for admission into Prep I is 3 + years. For Prep II it is 4 + years. Informal education is imparted to students in the pre-school. The children are made {{to do a lot}} of <b>oral</b> <b>work,</b> indulge in various kinds of activities, play games, do simple practicals, go for excursions, and observe different things and phenomenon. Teachers use several audio-visual aids in order to demonstrate the lessons. The aim of the curriculum at this stage is to make children creative and innovative. To develop good toilet habits, to encourage children to eat healthy foods and to make them aware of the benefits of good health. The Kindergarten school is of one year. The minimum age for admission to this class is 5+ years. Formal education stars from this class. Apart from <b>oral</b> <b>work,</b> activities, games, practicals and excursions children are introduced to subjects like English, Nepali, Maths, Science, Social Studies and Computer Studies.|$|E

Okyeame magazine sought to give voice to Kwame Nkrumah's dream of a new African identity. Articles called for a Ghanaian poetry whose content and form was based on oral tradition, drum poetry. These ran alongside traditional <b>oral</b> <b>works</b> translated by leading contemporary poets, such as founding editor Kofi Awoonor, and texts were interspersed with icons and Adinkra symbols.|$|R

40|$|The interdependent {{relationship}} which {{exists between}} personality characteristics of adolescents and their achievements in oral examinations have been investigated. The following related aspects were {{studied in the}} literature: * * * The role of oral evaluation in English. Personality characteristics which are meaningful to achievement in <b>oral</b> <b>work.</b> Ways to measure personality with special reference to the High School Personality Questionnaire. An empirical study inter alia revealed the following: {i) Low oral achievers are emotionally less stable than high achievers. (ii) Verbal intelligence, emotional instability, anxiety experience and introvertedness play an influential role in achievement in <b>oral</b> <b>work.</b> (iii) Girls tend to achieve better in <b>oral</b> <b>work</b> in the secondary school than boys. The educational implications of the investigation relate to the adequate becoming-adult of the adolescent. The role of the educand's personality in oral examinations and the need of teachers to possess more information about this matter during evaluation, have been revealed in this study.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{language}} teachers regarded the microcomputer {{as merely a}} drill-andpractice machine. One of its main disadvantages {{seemed to be that}} it could only be used in certain areas of language teaching, and not,for example, in <b>oral</b> <b>work.</b> In this paper it is argued that advances in hardware as well as software now make the microcomputer an all-rounder with regard to language teaching. Not only can the analogue sound storage facilities enhance listening comprehension practice {{but it can also be}} used for listening practice for different dialects. Advances in software development,for example simulation programmes, open new possibilities for oral group work. Data base programmes can also be used for gathering and organising information before <b>oral</b> <b>work</b> commences. It is emphasized in this paper that the microcomputer will not easily become a willing and able partner in real conversation. On the other hand, if one looks at the recent advances in educational technology, an electronic conversation partner may be part of the language teaching scenario sooner than anticipated by language teachers...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of criticality in Modern Languages graduates in the UK.

40|$|Kaba Gombang Patuana (abbreviated to KGP) is a Minang {{literary}} genre whichis orally {{presented in}} the form of songs. Therefore, it is known as an intonational prose.

The mediumneeded is {{in the form of}} a performance known as Pertunjukan Kak Oai (PKO), whichexists at Kenagarian Air Haji, Pesisir Selatan Regency, West Sumatra. Kaba GambangPatuanan tells about the socio cultural life of the community of Pesisir Selatan Regencyusing the local variety of Minangkabau language. The availability of the texts of KGP,the performance of PKO, and the collective community possessing such a literary workshows that the phenomenon of what is written and spoken about <b>oral</b> literary <b>work</b> isdifferent from the phenomenon of what is written and spoken about written literary <b>work.</b> <b>Oral</b> literary <b>work</b> cannot be approached from literary discipline only, but linguisticapproach and anthropological approach are also needed. The morphology of KGP is made up of stem of the story ‘batang curito’, branchof the story ‘dahan curito’, and twig of the story ‘rantiang curito’. The batang curito(the stem of the story) is the text of GPP as a whole. The ‘Dahan Curito’ (the branch ofthe story) serves as the episodes of the story and the Ranting Curito serves as the parts ofthe episode. The functions performed by KGP are: (1) as a medium for conveying what isexpected from a king; (2) as a medium for conveying Minang tradition; (3) as a mediumfor conveying oceanic knowledge; (4) as a medium for conveying nation-lovingenthusiasm ‘chauvinism’; (5) as a medium for conveying henotheism towards ancestors...|$|R

40|$|For {{autonomous}} learners of Japanese language, {{especially for}} the overseas ’ residents, speaking {{is the most difficult}} skill to develop when learning through Internet or e-Learning. To overcome this difficulty, the authors develop an e-Learning courseware which includes modules encouraging learners to speak out-loud, giving confidence on pronunciation and keeping their motivation high. In the courseware, the pronunciation module provides information how a native speaker produces sounds difficult for most learners of Japanese by presenting the close-up views of the mouth in stereo image. When watched with spectacles with red and blue cellophane paper, the stereo image clip delivers three-dimensional view and facilitates learners to recognize how to pronounce the sound. The record-and-submit module encourages learners to speak out-loud, as learners get feedback for their <b>oral</b> <b>work</b> from the instructors via e-mail or bulletin board. As the evaluation of the modules and the system is still undergoing, the design concept of the courseware is discussed in the paper. ...|$|E
