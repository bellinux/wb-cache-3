500|$|On September 21, 1996, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines {{marriage}} for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA [...] "was a political decision that they made {{at the time of}} a re-election". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to [...] "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely {{in the context of a}} [...] "very reactionary Congress". Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, [...] "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the president re-elected." [...] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something [...] "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims [...] "historic revisionism". In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, [...] "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments." [...] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
