The Latin name Caesarea was also applied to the colony of New Jersey as Nova Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs in part because <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E

5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled {{gay men and}} lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening <b>of</b> <b>associations,</b> tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

40|$|Odds {{ratios and}} log-linear {{parameters}} are not collapsible, meaning that including a variable into the analysis or omitting one from it, {{may change the}} strength <b>of</b> <b>association</b> among the remaining variables. Even the direction <b>of</b> <b>association</b> may be reversed, a fact that is often discussed {{under the name of}} Simpson's paradox. A parameter <b>of</b> <b>association</b> is directionally collapsible, if this reversal cannot occur. The paper investigates the existence <b>of</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>association</b> which are directionally collapsible. It is shown, that subject to two simple assumptions, no parameter <b>of</b> <b>association,</b> which depends only on the conditional distributions, like the odds ratio does, can be directionally collapsible. The main result is that every directionally collapsible parameter <b>of</b> <b>association</b> gives the same direction <b>of</b> <b>association</b> as a linear contrast of the cell probabilities does. The implication for dealing with Simpson's paradox is that there is exactly one way to associate direction with the association in any table, so that the paradox never occur...|$|R
