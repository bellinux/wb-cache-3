5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> <b>and</b> it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into his model.|$|E
40|$|For {{robot arm}} {{set-point}} control, a novel PD based algorithm for the estimation <b>and</b> compensation <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> force <b>and</b> static friction is proposed. Based on the linear-in-parameter property <b>of</b> the <b>gravity</b> force <b>and</b> the steady state feature of PD set-point control, the algorithm modifies the set-points {{according to the}} steady state position errors. Using the steady state equations near the given set-points the unknown static friction force <b>and</b> <b>gravity</b> force can be calculated on-line. This information can then be used to compensate the affects <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> force <b>and</b> static friction to eliminate set-point errors...|$|R

5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements {{that have an}} atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter the force <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due {{to the lack of}} energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>and</b> of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> <b>and</b> independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

40|$|The density front {{bounding}} a gravity {{current is}} usually highly unstable and {{this leads to}} mixing between the fluid <b>of</b> the <b>gravity</b> current <b>and</b> that <b>of</b> the surroundings.

We find that substantial mixing occurs {{in the early stages of}} the evolution <b>of</b> lock-release <b>gravity</b> currents <b>and</b> that this mixing leads to the formation of a complex internal density structure. Mixed fluid is produced across the concentration range and we examine the mixing rates. By contrasting three experiments with different lock aspect ratios, we examine the effect of the aspect ratio of the release on the subsequent evolution of the flow. I...|$|R
