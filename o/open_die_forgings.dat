As compared to cold forging, warm forging enables to reduce forging forces size considerably. Development of warm forging technology is connected to formability and plasticity research of forged material at warm temperatures.

This is a procedure allowing quick and accurate changes to selected parameters of the thermomechanical treatment. Due to the high dynamics of the process, material-technological models and forming technologies with high strain rates and with steep gradients in temperature changes can be designed using this method. The current state of technology also allows the use of this method for die forging. The paper is focused on the issues of material-technological modelling of <b>die</b> <b>forgings</b> made from C 45 and the possibility of its application to designing changes and optimization of forming and heat treatment technology. The first phase of the solution is the creation of a material-technological model for a real forging. The objective of this phase was to achieve the desired agreement between the model and the real forging. In the second phase, this model was used to replace the conventionally processed material C 45 by thermomechanical micro-alloyed steel 30 MnVS 6. The aim of the controlled cooling from the forging temperature was to achieve structures without heat treatment, which is currently a necessary part of the manufacturing process.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some of the results from an {{examination}} of sample <b>die</b> <b>forgings</b> in aluminium-lithium alloys 2091 and 8090. Whilst direct comparison of properties of the two forgings is complicated by the differing configurations, useful data has, nevertheless, been generated which will provide useful background information for further programmes about to commence. The present study has revealed density reductions of ~ 8 % and ~ 10 % respectively for the 2091 and 8090 compositions, compared to current 2 xxx series alloys. With regard to microstructure, the 2091 forging exhibited predominantly unrecrystallised grains which contained linear features postulated to originate from a mechanical/deformation twinning type of mechanism. In contrast, the 8090 component showed extensive recrystallisation. Microhardness measurements indicated lithium and magnesium depletion at surface locations while optical and electron microscopy suggested that apparent porosity bands on the polished microsections were due to the presence of the equilibrium δ-AlLi phase, particles of which fragment and are removed during metallographic preparation. Mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy in the 2091 forging and were attributed to texture effects. Highest strengths were obtained in the longitudinal direction, while the lowest appeared at ~ 30 ° and ~ 70 ° to the longitudinal direction : long transverse strengths were intermediate. The resulting failure modes are briefly discussed. In contrast, mechanical properties in the 8090 component exhibited a gradual increase in strength from longitudinal to long transverse directions, in keeping with the recrystallised nature of this forging...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of internal voids is commonly observed throughout the casting and solidification of large size ingots. Their mechanical closure is generally achieved {{during the initial}} deformation of a hot forming process. The present work focuses on the determination of optimal forging conditions for void elimination in large steel ingots {{with respect to the}} involved materials and industrial processes. A state of the art is compiled as initial research in order to develop a solid background in void elimination theory. An extensive review of void closure models is presented and characterisation techniques are discussed. It is shown that current void closure models lack application to industrial scale forgings. An analysis of the industrial partner’s <b>open</b> <b>die</b> forging procedure ensues and characteristic forging sequences are introduced. Feasibility for further forging analysis using experimental data is evaluated and successfully proposed. A novel method for fast calculating void closure models is developed. Rational polynomial functions are established for the calculation of material dependant constants. 3 D mapping is used to evaluate the influence of the triaxiality state and material parameters. The void closure model is validated for use on high strength steels from the industrial partner. Void closure is modeled and simulated during an <b>open</b> <b>die</b> forging sequence. The effect of in-billet void positioning is studied and the forging sequence effectiveness for void closure is validated and characterized for different zones.
