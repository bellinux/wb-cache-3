5|$|In {{addition}} to causing {{about two-thirds of}} its members to quit between 1906 and 1910, the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu, industries, and regions from which the organization drew its members. Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left {{as a result of}} the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the Ruhr area, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before World War I, a sign <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> after the war.|$|E
25|$|Some routes {{were closed}} during the 1950s {{to take account}} of {{changing}} transport patterns and to remove obvious route duplication. For instance, in East Anglia most of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway was closed in 1959; long-distance passenger trains on the former Great Central Railway main line ended in 1960 as a prelude to its later closure. However, the route closures were just a small taste <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{platform}} game to use scrolling graphics came {{years before}} the genre became a trend. Jump Bug is a simple platform-shooter developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei/Coreland and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after Donkey Kong. Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills. As part of a nascent genre, its development was not strongly influenced by existing conventions, nor was it {{said to be a}} major influence on games immediately after it. Jump Bug offered an early glimpse <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> with uneven, independently suspended platforms and levels that scroll both horizontally and vertically. This style of gameplay was further refined in the arcades by such games as 1983's Major Havoc.|$|E

25|$|Cradle of Filth's {{first three}} years saw three demos (Invoking the Unclean, Orgiastic Pleasures Foul and Total Fucking Darkness) {{recorded}} amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than twenty musicians in its history. An album entitled Goetia was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone {{went out of business}} and could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, was Cacophonous's first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> with lead singer Dani Filth's vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop. The album was well-received however, and as recently as June 2006 found its way into Metal Hammers list of the top ten black metal albums of the last twenty years.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Link Wray was {{an early}} {{influence}} on garage rock and used innovative guitar techniques and effects such as power chords and distortion.

500|$|After four {{consecutive}} seasons of bowl berths and finishes {{in at least}} one of the polls, West Virginia went on a two-year drought in 1985 and 1986, finishing those seasons with records of 7–3–1 and 4–7 (Nehlen's first of only four losing seasons) respectively. [...] The shortcomings of those seasons came to a head in 1987, where the Mountaineers endured a season of growing pains and near-misses. [...] Despite a 1–3 start, West Virginia rallied to finish the regular season at 6–5 with four of its five losses coming by deficits of 5 points or less. Freshman quarterback Major Harris led the way for the Mountaineers, compiling 16 total touchdowns and providing glimpses <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in his illustrious collegiate career. [...] The season culminated in a 35–33 loss to No. 11 Oklahoma State in the Sun Bowl, a game in which the Mountaineers led 24–14 at halftime and lost on a failed two-point conversion attempt with 1:13 remaining.|$|E

500|$|Besides Divine Providence, Villani {{acknowledged}} {{other events}} {{that he believed}} were explainable via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as Pope ClementIV's prophecy on the outcome for the Battle of Tagliacozzo. He believed that certain events were really omens <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by BonifaceVIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion. He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope's beating and untimely death shortly after fighting PhilipIV at Anagni; Villani wrote: [...] "when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then {{the dissolution of the}} Church will begin." [...] He also believed in astrology and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities. However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.|$|E
500|$|G.I. Blues, {{the soundtrack}} to Presley's first film since his return, was a number one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, His Hand in Mine, {{followed}} two months later. It reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the UK, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, {{on behalf of}} 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records. A 12-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody. As described by John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Presley himself over the next half-decade, the album is largely [...] "a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music {{that had once been}} Elvis's birthright." [...] It would be his sixth number one LP.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{a two-part}} hip hop track {{entitled}} [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was released onto Beyoncé's Soundcloud account. [...] "Bow Down", produced by Hit-Boy, was written after Beyoncé {{woke up one}} morning with a chant stuck in her head, feeling angry and defensive. This was melded with a Timbaland-produced second half, [...] "I Been On", that makes prominent use of a pitch-distorted vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene. Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as [...] "brilliantly odd", commending its loud, abrasive production, while Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz noted the song's assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé's existing catalogue, particularly for its aggressive nature. The song's atmosphere and its controversial [...] "Bow down, bitches" [...] refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio. Beyoncé clarified after the album's release, where elements of [...] "Bow Down" [...] appear on the track [...] "Flawless", that the song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment.|$|E

500|$|However, in his {{evaluation}} of The Secret Service as a whole, La Rivière {{argues that the}} premise of a secret agent masquerading as a priest while driving an antiquated car could not have appealed much to children, and that older viewers would have been disappointed with the series' unoriginal [...] "traditional espionage format". Ian Fryer concurs, writing in FAB magazine that [...] "very little about The Secret Service has obvious appeal to the traditionally young Supermarionation audience." [...] Discussing the opening theme music, he remarks that [...] "the younger me would have run a mile from any series which sounded like that." [...] He also notes that the opening credits [...] "broke with the tradition of having a thrilling or suspenseful promise <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and made the series look suspiciously like it might be about the life and work of an elderly vicar." [...] For La Rivière, the blending of puppetry and live action [...] "simply doesn't work. It requires more than the audience can give in terms of acceptance." [...] In the case of [...] "More Haste Less Speed", {{he points out that}} the character of Lady Hazlewell is portrayed in live-action distance shots by a stunt actor dressed in drag – an [...] "unintentionally hilarious moment that illustrates beautifully why the live-action inserts didn't work." [...] He further argues that the contrasting light levels of shots that alternate between one format and the other shatter the illusion of [...] "artificiality" [...] that previous series had been able to sustain in the absence of live action.|$|E

Soon after its release, Paper Walls became the second most popular album on iTunes and the most popular album in the alternative section. On July 9, Yellowcard released Paper Walls on the group's Myspace music player to give fans a taste <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on the new album. Paper Walls was released in the U.S. on July 17 (July 16 on iTunes) in an additional CD/DVD format, as Lights and Sounds was the previous year. The DVD contains exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the band, an extensive photo gallery and two additional live bonus tracks. In June 2007, Yellowcard was voted to do AOL Sessions Under Cover. It was released on July 20 and featured two songs from Paper Walls. The album debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 40,000 copies in its first week.|$|E
2500|$|Fibber McGee and Molly {{originated}} {{when the}} small-time husband-and-wife vaudevillians began their third year as Chicago-area radio performers. Two {{of the shows}} they did for station WENR beginning in 1927, both written by Harry Lawrence, bore traces <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and rank {{as one of the}} earliest forms of situation comedy. In their Luke and Mirandy farm-report program, Jim played a farmer who was given to tall tales and face-saving lies for comic effect. In a weekly comedy, The Smith Family, Marian's character was an Irish wife of an American police officer. These characterizations, plus the Jordans' change from being singers/musicians to comic actors, pointed toward their future; it was at this time when Marian developed and perfected the radio character [...] "Teeny". It was also at WENR where the Jordans met Donald Quinn, a cartoonist who was then working in radio, and the couple hired him as their writer in 1931. They regarded Quinn's contribution as important and included him as a full partner; the salary for Smackout and Fibber McGee and Molly was split between the Jordans and Quinn.|$|E
2500|$|News {{regarding}} Leno leaked via {{an obscure}} website, FTV Live, {{by the following}} morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno and O'Brien's fates.

[...] "I know how hard I worked for this", responded O'Brien. [...] "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story, and, according to Bill Carter in The War for Late Night, essentially reversed the rumor with a headline reading, [...] "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top." [...] O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action", wrote Carter), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.|$|E
