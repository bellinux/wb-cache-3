40|$|The Slovene language, {{besides being}} the {{teaching}} language, {{is one of}} the core subjects in our school system. Consequently, teachers should strive to prepare lessons of the highest possible quality. However, the quality of lessons to some extent depends on the quality of homework. The intent of the present master’s thesis is to discern how important Slovene homework is to the third, fourth and fifth grade teachers, what kind of homework they give based on the content and difficulty, how often they assign homework, what the source of the material is, how important it is for them to <b>check</b> <b>homework,</b> and in what way they check it. All these variables are checked both for grammar and literature lessons. We are also interested in seeing if the grades in which the teachers lecture and the years of teaching experience affect the aforementioned variables. The data was acquired with a questionnaire for teachers and partly structured observation of Slovene lessons in third, fourth and fifth grade. The data was statistically processed using SPSS software. The chi-square test of independence was used to identify differences among teachers. The research confirms the anticipated results to a great extent. Most teachers give homework at almost every Slovene lesson. They also regularly <b>check</b> <b>homework</b> and keep a record of which pupils finished it. Results show that statistically important differences in teachers based on the grades in which they lecture and their years of experience appear only in rare cases. In most cases, the data from the sample could not be generalized to the basic set. With this research an insight into Slovene language homework has been obtained for the first time. A fair amount of positive feedback has been received from the teachers, who filled out the questionnaire. They reflected upon the homework they give to their pupils during the filling out of the questionnaire. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} the full model (model 5) show that the higher the family’s {{socioeconomic}} status, the better children’s academic achievement: for every 1  year of increase in parental education, the child’s benchmark score will increase by 0.118; for every 1 % increase in household income, the child’s benchmark test score will increase by 0.26. The higher the parental education participation scores (such as <b>checking</b> <b>homework,</b> discussing school issues, etc.), the better the children’s academic performance achieved. In terms {{of the impact of}} educational opportunities on children’s academic achievement, the quality of children’s school attendance, and the educational services provided by the market (whether attended a remedial class) have significant positive effects on academic performance.

30|$|There are {{conflicting}} empirical {{findings and}} considerable inconsistencies regarding {{the relationship between}} parental involvement and a student’s academic achievement (Fan & Chen, 2001; McNeal, 2012). Whereas some authors assert that parental involvement is generally a salient factor in explaining behavioral but not cognitive outcomes (McNeal, 1999), others underline the undeniable role played in children’s outcomes by various types of social support provided by parents, family members, significant others and peers (Jeynes, 2007; Malecki & Demaray, 2003; Spera, 2005). Fan & Chen (2001) observe a small to moderate, and practically meaningful, relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement.

In addition, cultural background is one of important factor that influences parental involvement. The number of immigrant students in the United States is increasing however, only a few studies have examined the immigrant parents' involvement in their child's education.

When compared to production, transport, services, etc education, as a rule, slowly opens to new technologies. However, children at their homes and outside the schools live in a technologically rich environment, and they expect the change in education in accordance with the imperatives of the education for the twenty-first century. In this sense, systems for automated data processing, multimedia systems, then distance learning, virtual schools and other technologies are being introduced into education.

Mathematics and computers often appear together in the teaching process. Taking into account the teaching of mathematics, computers and software packages have a significant role. The program requirements are not dominant. The emphasis is on mathematical content and the method of presentation.

40|$|Assessment in {{education}} can have many purposes. It is claimed that in Afghanistan, {{most of the}} teachers do assessment of learning rather than assessment for learning. They pay more attention on grading to encourage the students to study their lesson to pass grades with higher scores, which in turn promote competitive not cooperative learning. Many teachers assess students for evaluation and put students {{in a situation that}} student should study not for learning but for marks. Such a views and practices of assessment do not promote active and productive learning in schools (Schunk, 2011). In this study, it is tried to find out the teachers’ views on assessment practice and teachers’ understanding of assessment, an area where there were not much attention paid in Afghanistan. The study has been conducted in five districts of Bamyan province (Center of Bamyan, Shibar, Yakawlang, Panjab and Waras districts) where views of 85 schools teachers were collected through a questionnaire. Additionally, teaching of 15 teachers (among the 85 respondent) have been observed through a structured classroom observation. The main finding is that all of the teachers stated that assessment is important in the classroom and assessment help both teachers and students. Almost half of the teachers provide feedback to their students. All teachers pointed out that teachers should ask question in the class. When the students did not understand the questions, majority of the teachers stated that the questions should be repeated. The way that teachers ask questions is said to be put randomly to student. When teaching was observed, it was found that, half of the teachers ask how and why questions from the students. Half of the teachers <b>checked</b> students’ <b>homework</b> instead of crossing or saying it is ok. These finding indicates that teachers are {{aware of the importance of}} assessment for learning. These views of assessment have not been observed when they teach. The contradiction observed in teachers’ views and practices might mean that although they are aware of the importance but maybe they do not know how to put it in to practice. Half of the teachers provide feedback to their students which indicate that they understand the effectiveness of giving feedback to students. Asking question in the class by teachers means that they know that questions can help teachers and students whether teachers deliver the message of the lesson and students understand the lesson. The type of question which teachers asked show that which type of question is the best way to check students understanding of an issue or and math formula in an example. Finally, teachers <b>check</b> students’ <b>homework</b> means that teachers realize that <b>checking</b> <b>homework</b> is an effective assessment practice which it can really improve students’ performance in the class and it may be a good way of encourage students. An overall a conclusion can be drawn that teachers even aware of the importance and processes of assessment in math teaching may have problem in how to materialize in practice of teaching and lack the knowledge and skills of the main features of assessment for learning.

40|$|This mixed-methods paper investigates {{whether the}} ‘private school premium’, as {{manifested}} in student learning outcomes, {{is the result}} of better-quality teaching in private schools. Using school-, community- and household-level data from the Young Lives longitudinal study in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, this paper makes a detailed comparison of 227 government and private schools attended by the children in the sample. The results from our regression analysis suggest that privately educated children have a significantly higher (at 1 per cent) mathematics score than children in government schools. While characteristics of teachers like experience, gender, content knowledge and subject specialisation do not have any significant influence on children’s learning outcome, teaching practices like regularly <b>checking</b> <b>homework</b> and factors such as the proximity of the teacher's residence to the school and teachers’ attitude towards the children, as well as teachers’ perceptions of their schools, have emerged as important determinants. In short, it is what the teacher ‘believes and does’ in the classroom that has the maximum impact on children’s learning outcomes. Another key finding is that the students of teachers with professional qualifications have significantly higher outcomes (at 10 per cent in value-added specification) than children taught by teachers with only senior secondary education. But students of teachers with degrees in Education do not have significantly better outcomes than those taught by teachers with general degrees, after controlling for other factors. This has significant implications for policy on teacher recruitment and pre-service teacher training, as well as the development of regulatory frameworks. Setting standards for teaching and learning, to create appropriate benchmarks for both government and private schools, should be addressed as a matter of urgency.

HTTP was chosen as the underlying protocol because it is well understood by security professionals and widely deployed. The protocol {{is designed to}} operate interactively as well as a web service (computer to computer), so users can try the system manually before proceeding to automation. BGS has provided examples in both Java and CURL. The BGS implementation of the protocol has a number of features designed to protect against malicious use, including: o HTTP digest authentication (RFC 2617) <b>o</b> <b>Checks</b> on the type and size of file uploaded o Daily limits on the amount of data an observatory can deposit The user uses the HTML file upload standard (RFC 1867) to deposit a file in the cache. to show how to automate uploading of data Setting standards for global exchange of real-time data Simon Flower...|$|R

40|$|In 2010 {{a book by}} Amy Chua: Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother was {{published}} and it sparked a broad discussion among pedagogues and the open society about the factors determining educational success. Chua forms a simple and provocative thesis – the Chinese mothers are {{the best in the}} world because they don’t spoil their children, quickly introduce them into the adult culture, have high expectations of them, they are brusque and cold but they teach their children how to survive and be competitive. Chua shows this educational model as a contrast to the Western model, where the children have their own, naive and sentimental culture, their own shops and catwalks in shopping malls. The results of systematic research on education seem to prove something quite different. The educational success has to be measured using different scales, because it depends on different factors. The data published by OECD show that the level of education depends on the educational tradition of the society, level of GDP, intergenerational contacts, level of education of teachers and their social status. A strong determiner is the family, but not necessarily the mother. Even more, there is a strong correlation between the results in learning and a supporting stance of the parents, but also with their habit of spending free time with their children. The parents who take their children to the cinema, an a trip, gossip with them or take them to McDonalds, can be sure that their children will have statistically higher than the average grades. Detailed results from other sources show that success correlates the most with grades from previous class, parents’ habit of talking about things at school, higher education of the parents, being a child of a single mother, signing the child up for extracurricular classes from music and the mother working part-time. Failure correlates with being an Afro-American or Latino, <b>checking</b> <b>homework</b> by parents, free time after school without any supervision, talking about results at school with the father. Moreover, it turns out that different factors determine good results in maths and natural science and other in the humanities...|$|R
