5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see <b>organosilicon).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chemical vapor {{deposition}} of silicon carbide (SiC-CVD) {{is a complex}} process involving a Si-C-H system wherein {{a large number of}} reaction steps occur. To simulate such a system requires knowledge of thermochemical and transport properties of all the species involved in the process. The accuracy of this information consequently becomes a crucial factor toward the correctness of the outcome prediction. In this work, the thermochemical data for several important growth species for SiC CVD using the SiH 4 /CxHy/H 2 system has been calculated. For the most part an excellent agreement is seen with previously reported data, however for the <b>organosilicons</b> a larger deviation is detected and in particular for the CH 3 SiH 2 SiH species which shows a stark deviation from the CHEMKIN database.

Here, we present a comparative study of SiCl 4, SiHCl 3, SiH 4 +HCl, C 3 H 8, C 2 H 4 and CH 4 {{in an attempt to}} find the optimal precursor combination. We find that while the chlorinated silanes SiCl 4 and especially SiHCl 3 give higher growth rate than natural silane and HCl, SiH 4 +HCl gives better morphology at C/Si around 1 and SiCl 4 gives the best morphology at low C/Si. Our study shows no effect on doping incorporation with precursor chemistry. We suggest that these results {{can be explained by the}} number of reaction steps in the gas phase chemical reaction mechanisms for producing SiCl 2, which is the most important Si species, and by formation of <b>organosilicons</b> in the gas phase.

25|$|Silicon in {{its more}} common {{crystalline}} form {{was not prepared}} until 31 years later, by Deville. By electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately 10% silicon, {{he was able to}} obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854. Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms, the most recent being silicene in 2010. Meanwhile, research on the chemistry of silicon continued; Friedrich Wöhler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by Alfred Stock, despite early speculation on the matter dating {{as far back as the}} beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s. Similarly, the first <b>organosilicon</b> compound, tetraethylsilane, was synthesised by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1863, but detailed characterisation of <b>organosilicon</b> chemisry was only done in the early 20th century by Frederick Kipping.|$|E

40|$|Several {{members of}} two new classes of bicyclic <b>organosilicons,</b> 3 -silabicyclo 3. 2. 1 octanes (3 -SBO) and 2 -silabicyclo 2. 2. 1 heptanes (2 -SBH), were {{prepared}} by five- and seven-step synthetic sequences, respectively. Reaction of the bis-organomagnesium reagent of cis- 1, 3 -bis(bromomethyl) cyclopentane with trichloromethylsilane, trichlorophenylsilane, or silicon tetrachloride was used to prepare derivatives of the 3 -SBO system. Platinum-catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilation of 4 -(dichlorosilyl) methylcyclopentene or 4 -(chloromethylsilyl) methylcyclopentene gave access to the 2 -SBH series. New compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, (2 ̆ 71) H and (2 ̆ 713) C NMR, IR, and/or mass spectrometry; (2 ̆ 729) Si NMR spectra were obtained for 3 -SBO, endo- and exo- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO, 2 -SBH, and endo- and exo- 2 -methyl- 2 -SBH. A unique mode of fragmentation was observed in the mass spectra of the isomers of 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO involving loss of H(, 2); this fragmentation gave the base peak in the spectrum of exo- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO, whereas a corresponding peak of low intensity was observed for endo- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO. Electron diffraction analyses were obtained for 3 -SBO and endo- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO; the latter analysis provided an unambiguous isomer assignment which was extended to six other isomer pairs in the 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO series through correlation of several physical properties. Isomers of 2 -methyl- 2 -SBH derivatives were assigned from the NMR spectral properties. The stereochemistry of several reactions of 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO derivatives was studied; the results paralleled those observed for acyclic <b>organosilicons.</b> Studies of the stereochemistry of reactions of 2 -methyl- 2 -SBH derivatives were initiated. LAH reduction of 3 -chloro- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO occurred with inversion of configuration, but the stereochemistry of reduction of 2 -chloro- 2 -methyl- 2 -SBH was more complex. The isomers of 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO, 3 -methoxy- 3 -methyl- 3 -SBO, 3 -methyl- 3 -phenyl- 3 -SBO, and 2 -methyl- 2 -SBH were equilibrated by treatment with CsF in polar, aprotic solvents; (+) -(alpha) -naphthylphenylmethylsilane (I) was also readily racemized.

A gas mixture containing C 2 H 2 F 4, i-C 4 H 10 and SF 6 is recirculated inside the RPCs during their use and subjected to degradation due to the production of fluoride ions which limits the sensitivity of the RPCs. This paper describes a new sensor that is able to detect low concentrations of fluoride ions in gas mixtures. The sensor is made of a plastic optic fiber (POF) which is made sensitive to F- gaseous ions by means of a thin layer of a glass-like material, deposited via plasma onto the fiber core. The F- ions attack the glass-like film and alter the transmission capability of the fiber so that the detection simply requires a LED and a photodiode. The sensor exploits a cumulative response which makes it suitable for direct estimation of the total exposure to the F - ions, thus providing a tool {{that can be used to}} tune the maintenance of the gas filters.

40|$|TiO 2 -assisted {{photocatalytic}} oxidation (PCO) is {{an emerging}} technology for {{indoor air quality}} control and is also being evaluated as an alternative trace contaminant control technology for crew habitats in space exploration. Though there exists a vast range of literature {{on the development of}} photocatalysts and associated reactor systems, including catalyst performance and performance-influencing factors, the critical question of whether photocatalysts can sustain their initial catalytic activity {{over an extended period of}} operation has not been adequately addressed. For a catalyst to effectively serve as an air quality control product, it must be rugged enough to withstand exposure to a multitude of low concentration volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over long periods of time with minimal loss of activity. The objective of this study was to determine the functional lifetime of a promising photocatalyst - the silica-titania composite (STC) from Sol Gel Solutions, LLC in a real-world scenario. A bench-scale STC-packed annular reactor under continuous irradiation by a UV-A fluorescent black-light blue lamp ((lambda) max = 365 nm) was exposed to laboratory air continuously at an apparent contact time of 0. 27 sand challenged with a known concentration of ethanol periodically to assess any changes in catalytic activity. Laboratory air was also episodically spiked with halocarbons (e. g., octafluoropropane), organosulfur compounds (e. g., sulfur hexafluoride), and <b>organosilicons</b> (e. g., siloxanes) to simulate accidental releases or leaks of such VOCs. Total organic carbon (TOC) loading and contaminant profiles of the laboratory air were also monitored.

25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise <b>organosilicon</b> chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E

40|$|AA 2024 {{aluminum}} alloy is widely employed in aeronautic and automobilist industries. Its hardness and low density are attractive properties for such industrial areas. However, since it contains copper, it undergoes severe corrosion in aggressive media as saline or low Earth orbit environments. In this work, it was investigated {{the properties of}} films deposited by PECVD on AA 2024 {{aluminum alloy}} {{as well as the}} corrosion resistance of the film/substrate systems under different corrosive atmospheres. Films were prepared in a plasma atmosphere composed of 50 % of oxygen and 50 % of hexamethyldisiloxane resulting in a total gas pressure of 4. 0 Pa. Plasma ignition was promoted by the application of radiofrequency signal (13. 56 MHz) to the sample holder while grounding the topmost electrode. The plasma excitation power, P, was changed from 10 to 80 W in the six different set of experiments. Film thickness, measured by profilometer, increases by 5 times as P was elevated from 10 to 80 W. As demonstrated by the infrared spectra of the samples, films are essentially <b>organosilicons</b> with preservation of functional groups of the precursor molecule and with creation of different ones. The oxide proportion and the structure crosslinking degree are affected by the plasma excitation power. According to the results obtained by sessile drop technique, hydrophilic to moderately hydrophobic films are produced with changing P from 10 to 80 W. The corrosion resistance, evaluated by salt spray and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, experiments, in general increases after film deposition. It is demonstrated that film deposition improves, in up to 36 times, the resistance of the alloy to salt spray attack. It is also shown an improvement of about 240 times in the alloy resistance under NaCl solution by the EIS data. Micrographs acquired by Scanning Electron Microscopy after the corrosion tests furnish further information on the importance of the layer physical stability on its barrier properties. Furthermore, films highly protect the alloy against the oxygen attack. Interpretations are proposed based on the modification of the plasma kinetics with P, altering film structure, composition and properties...|$|R

2500|$|Because the Si–C bond {{is close}} in {{strength}} to the C–C bond, <b>organosilicon</b> compounds {{tend to be}} markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, tetraphenylsilane (SiPh4) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428°C, and so can its substituted derivatives Ph3SiCl and Ph2SiCl2, which boil at 378°C and 305°C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, <b>organosilicon</b> chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds. However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si–F bond is significantly stronger than even the C–F bond {{and is one of}} the strongest single bonds, while the Si–H bond is much weaker than the C–H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some <b>organosilicon</b> reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the SN2 or SN1 processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si–C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C–O σ* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called [...] "SN2 at silicon" [...] for simplicity.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} useful silicon-containing groups is trimethylsilyl, Me3Si–. The Si–C bond {{connecting}} it {{to the rest of}} the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the fluoride ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for <b>organosilicon</b> compounds. It may be compared to acidic protons; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, selenium, or iodine), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes, but at the oxygen in silyl chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the silyl ether hexamethyldisiloxane, (Me3Si)2O. Conversely, while the SN2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous [...] "SN2" [...] reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl triflates are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. Trimethylsilyl triflate is in particular a very good Lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and silyl enol ethers, reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction.|$|E
