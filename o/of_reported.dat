40|$|Context: Poorly written {{radiology}} {{reports are}} common among residents {{and are a}} significant challenge for radiology education. While training may improve report quality, a professionally developed reliable and valid scale to measure report quality does not exist. Objectives: To develop a measurement tool for report quality, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, with rigorous validation through empirical data. Methods: A research team of an experienced psychometrician and six senior radiologists conducted qualitative and quantitative studies. Five items were identified for the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, each measuring a distinct aspect <b>of</b> <b>report</b> quality. Two dedicated training sessions were designed and implemented to help residents generate high-quality reports. In a blinded fashion, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale was applied to 804 randomly selected reports issued before (n[*]=[*] 403) and after (n[*]=[*] 401) training. Full-scale psychometrical assessments were implemented onto the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale’s item- and scale-scores from the <b>reports.</b> The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale scores were correlated with report professionalism and attendings’ preference and were compared pre-/post-training. Results: The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale showed sound psychometrical properties, with high validity and reliability. Reports with higher quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score were more professional and preferable by attendings. Training improved the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score, empirically validating the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale further. Conclusion: While succinct and practitioner friendly, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale is a reliable and valid measure <b>of</b> radiology <b>report</b> quality and {{has the potential to}} be easily adapted to other fields such as pathology, where similar training would be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Aim of {{the study}} is {{to get a better view}} of the {{contribution}} of pharmacists to the quantity and the quality <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and in this way to the quality <b>of</b> a voluntary <b>reporting</b> system <b>of</b> adverse drug reactions. Methods. 15, 293 reports, sent to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Foundation Lareb between 1995 and 2000 were analysed for the characteristics <b>of</b> pharmacists' <b>reports</b> and the differences with <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> physicians. Dispersion of adverse drug reaction was related to the different System and Organ Classes, the seriousness <b>of</b> the <b>reports</b> according to the CIOMS criteria and the documentation grade <b>of</b> the <b>reports.</b> 200 reports were at random selected and their quality assessed for the quality <b>of</b> the <b>reports.</b> Results. Pharmacists are responsible for 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>reports</b> sent in to Lareb during this period. Their reports more frequently concern adverse effects in relation to skin and the eyes. The seriousness <b>of</b> pharmacists' <b>reports</b> is less than with physician's reports as is the case with the documentation grade <b>of</b> <b>reports.</b> The quality <b>of</b> the clinical information <b>of</b> physicians' <b>reports</b> is higher.

5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
