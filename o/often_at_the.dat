5|$|By the mid-1980s, glam metal {{had begun}} to become a major {{mainstream}} success in America with many of these band's music videos appearing on heavy rotation on MTV <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of MTV's daily dial countdown, {{and some of the}} bands appeared on the channel's shows such as Headbanger's Ball, which {{became one of the most}} popular programs with over 1.3 million views a week. The groups also received heavy rotation on radio stations such as KNAC in Los Angeles.|$|E

As part of Germany's World Cup team, she won ten relay races and three mixed relay events. During six appearances at Biathlon World Championships, Neuner claimed 17 medals: twelve gold, four silver and one bronze. In addition, she has won seven junior world championship titles. Neuner {{was known as}} one of the fastest cross-country skiers in biathlon. She had been noted for her volatile shooting performances in the standing position, particularly in the early years of her career, <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of better results.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{side of a}} {{river or}} in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
25|$|Although {{facilitation}} is <b>often</b> studied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{level of}} individual species interactions, {{the effects of}} facilitation are <b>often</b> observable <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scale of the community, including impacts to spatial structure, diversity, and invasibility.|$|R

5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology {{for nearly a}} decade at this point, with the German technology <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E

Rangers head coach John Muckler publicly declared {{before the beginning of}} Malhotra's second NHL campaign that he would be nothing more than a career third-liner. Malhotra's potential was <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of an ongoing dispute between Muckler and Smith.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Civil War, the Confederacy {{maintained}} {{a network of}} underground operators in southern Maryland, particularly Charles and St. Mary's counties, smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents {{as far north as}} Canada. Booth recruited his friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlen as accomplices. They met <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house of Maggie Branson, a known Confederate sympathizer, at 16North Eutaw Street in Baltimore. He also met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at The Parker House in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center {{of political and}} business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role}} in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E

25|$|Resistance is <b>often,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> least, understandably protective: As {{anyone who}} can {{remember}} her or his own first uneasy encounters with particularly challenging new theories or theorists can attest, resistance serves to shield us from uncomfortable shifts or all-out upheavals in perception and understanding-shifts in perception which, if honored, force us to inhabit the world in fundamentally new and different ways.|$|E
25|$|Women's clubs, {{especially}} during the Progressive era, helped shape their communities and the country. Many progressive ideals were pressed into action through the resources of women's clubs, including kindergartens, juvenile courts, and park conservation. Women's clubs, many with their literary backgrounds, helped promote and raise money for schools, universities and libraries. Women's clubs were <b>often</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of various civil rights issues, denouncing lynching, promoting women's rights and voting rights.|$|E
