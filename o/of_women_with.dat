5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
5|$|The numbers <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI {{giving birth}} and having healthy babies are increasing. Around {{a half to}} two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; a recent study <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians {{are not included in}} a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E

5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|Similar figurines <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> phallus heads {{from the}} Neolithic period {{have been found}} across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. Those figures {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on marriage {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometrial cancer {{are treated with}} some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
