5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students.

Some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E

5|$|Charmbracelet is {{the ninth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on December 3, 2002 through MonarC Entertainment and Island Records. The album {{was her first}} release since her breakdown following the release of her film Glitter (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack album, {{both of which were}} critical and commercial failures from the previous year. Critics described Charmbracelet as one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> personal records, following 1997's Butterfly, Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, 7 Aurelius and Dre & Vidal.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that {{she could no longer}} dance. The news was devastating to her.|$|E

5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E

5|$|Her {{interest}} in {{education has been}} one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her cypher on its walls, while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.|$|E

Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller's supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development of Wilson Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted {{in support of the}} mayor's agenda.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} {{a few yards away}} from the body of a man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
5|$|Thus, when Harun {{asked for}} negotiations, Irene {{dispatched}} {{a delegation of}} three <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> senior officials: the Domestic Anthony, the magistros Peter, and Staurakios himself. Confident of their military position, they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own, {{so that when they}} arrived in the Arab camp, they were made prisoners. Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command, Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release, especially of her trusted aide Staurakios.|$|E

5|$|Blyton's Noddy, about {{a little}} wooden boy from Toyland, first {{appeared}} in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949, and in November that year Noddy Goes to Toyland, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including Noddy's Library, Noddy's Garage of Books, Noddy's Castle of Books, Noddy's Toy Station of Books and Noddy's Shop of Books.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Madonna {{played the}} {{starring}} role in the film, Evita, for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998), became one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> critically acclaimed releases, and won her a number of Grammy Awards, while being nominated for the Album of the Year. It also won her the VMA for Video of the Year for the title track. From 2001 to 2008, Madonna embarked on four worldwide concert tours—Drowned World (2001), Re-Invention (2004), Confessions (2006) and Sticky & Sweet (2008)—which received a total of eight nominations at the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, but won only one award for the Confessions Tour in 2006, {{in the category of}} Most Creative Stage Production. The Brit Awards have nominated Madonna in 12 categories, and in 2006 she won the International Female Solo Artist award, for her 10th studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor. In 2007, Madonna won another Grammy Award in the Best Long Form Music Video category, for the live release of the Confessions Tour.|$|E
5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled as one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>most</b> memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man {{proved to be a}} less than memorable one for her, so much so that in an interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, she could barely remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray the police officers Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
