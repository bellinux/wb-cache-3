40|$|Using {{variation}} in payday lending restrictions {{over time and}} across states, we study competition {{in the market for}} small, short-term consumer loans. We find that banks and credit unions reduce <b>overdraft</b> <b>credit</b> limits and fees when payday credit, a possible substitute, is prohibited. These findings suggest that depositories respond to payday loan bans by taking less risk, bouncing checks that they would have otherwise covered. The decline in overdraft fees is surprising when viewed in isolation, but sensible given that depositories incur lower credit losses as they limit overdraft coverage. We find some evidence that credit unions ’ overdraft activities are more profitable when payday loans are unavailable, consistent with decreased competition. In addition to characterizing the impact of prohibiting payday lending, a common state policy change in recent years, our findings illuminate competition in the small-dollar loan market...|$|E

Today the most common crediting methods in the banking practice are: <b>credit</b> line, <b>overdraft,</b> non-instalment term <b>credit.</b> Each of these methods has its own characteristics, which are suitable for specific areas of the organization activity. It has been found that the credit line benefit is that the borrower is given an opportunity within the fixed limit to use the credit funds immediately at the moment the need arises, which in its turn allows reducing the cost of the credit servicing, however, the main disadvantage of this method of crediting is {{that in the case of}} difficulties with the repayment of the previous tranche the bank may reduce or cancel the credit limit and enter an additional fee on the unclaimed <b>credit</b> line limit. <b>Overdraft</b> <b>crediting</b> is characterized by a rapid procedure of obtaining a credit, can be granted without security, does not have a targeted character, allows providing payments from the current account, at the same time the interest rate on the overdraft is higher than that on other credits, and another disadvantage is the requirement of mandatory and in a certain, relatively short time repaying the credit. Crediting in terms of lump-sum cash disbursement is characterized by simplicity in granting and consistency in the organization of the crediting process, but the accrual of interests occurs immediately after the transfer of funds to the borrower on the full amount of the received credit.

40|$|The {{conventional}} form of {{the demand}} function for money worked {{very well in the}} past. However, since 1974 this function has failed to predict the public 2 ̆ 7 s demand for the money stock within a reasonable range of error. More specifically, since 1976 the conventional equation has overpredicted the actual quantity of money demanded. Although the Federal Reserve 2 ̆ 7 s newly defined monetary aggregates generally have better prediction performance than the old M- 1, they show a systematic overprediction of money stock for the period of 1974 : 1 - 1980 : 3, the out-of-sample period in this study. The cumulative percentage errors of prediction of these new aggregates are still large and increasing in absolute value for this period. Respecifying the conventional demand function for money to include the time variable among its explanatory variables and redefining the monetary aggregate to contain overnight repurchase agreements reduced the absolute value of the percentage errors considerably. Moreover, the percentage errors of the above specification are relatively stable after 1975.

40|$|A line {{of credit}} or {{overdraft}} is a common contingent lending contract that is an alternative to a fixed or fully drawn loan. The latter has received much attention in empirical and theoretical analyses while the former has received virtually none. In particular, much effort has been put into investigating credit rationing, which {{has been defined as}} occurring when a borrower wants a larger loan than is offered at the ruling interest rate. The meaning of credit rationing in a {{line of credit}} or overdraft regime {{is the subject of this}} paper. An overdraft is the right to overdraw an account, up to a specified maximum and over an agreed period after which time credit limits are reviewed. The borrower pays interest on the credit he uses, which is determined by him up to the maximum allowable. In such a system, the lender faces uncertainty from two sources. First, when the credit limit is established there is uncertainty as to how much credit will actually be used during the life of the credit arrangement. This is significant to the lender because he may have to find cash to cover unexpected fluctuations in realised usage of the credit line. Second, there is uncertainty concerning the borrower’s ability to replay the overdraft loan plus interest when the overdraft contracts terminates. This is the default risk issue that is commonly addressed in the context of fixed loans. There are in effect two distinct demands for credit in an overdraft or line of credit system. First, there is the demand for the credit limit that is available in all contingencies and which is independent of the second demand, which is the actual drawing against the credit limit. This leads quite naturally to two concepts of credit rationing with overdraft, which I shall call ex ante and ex post. Ex ante rationing occurs when a borrower would like a larger credit limit, given his expectations of the interest rate he will be charged, prior to his actual use of the credit limit. That is, the borrower can anticipate the possibility of some situations in which he might face a binding credit constraint. Ex post rationing occurs when the borrower needs more credit than his limit given the interest rate. This paper is concerned with the existence of ex ante credit rationing in a credit market in which there are no interest rate ceilings on borrowers and lenders, and the credit market is assumed to be competitive in that lenders earn zero expected profit. The result is obtained in a simple two period model in which the borrower requires credit to finance a loan project that is subject to diminishing returns (such as a perfect competitor financing production subject to increasing marginal costs) and faces default risk. A further complication is introduced by assuming that the borrower has a random source of revenue during the life of the credit agreement and this random revenue affects his need for credit from the lender. This model is an abstraction from reality that tries to capture three features of real-life line of credit arrangements: (i) such facilities are typically available to borrowers who are financing working capital and whose revenue from the sale of output may be randomly spaced during the time the credit facility exists. (ii) since the borrower’s cash flow is irregular, then to the extent that <b>overdraft</b> <b>credit</b> and retained earnings are the only source of working capital to the borrower any fluctuations in cash flow will have an impact on the demand for borrowed credit. (iii) the credit facility is never established for an indefinite period, but rather is set up subject to review after a finite period. Once established, the limit is not altered until the review date. This abstracts, of course, from any central bank directive concerning limitations on lending rights. In addition to showing the existence of ex ante credit rationing, the paper also considers the impact of an alternative asset for the borrower to invest in in addition to working capital. As expected, the existence of the asset, by increasing the opportunities to the borrower, leads to a demand for a larger credit limit. The effect of a binding ceiling on lending rate is to raise the average rate of credit utilisation and to increase the degree of credit rationing. ...|$|E

50|$|When a {{traditional}} deposit bank provide loans such as business lending, mortgage, <b>overdraft</b> or <b>credit</b> card, they are {{stuck with the}} borrowers for years or even decades.

Therefore, in SIV intermediation, there is the same incentive to assess credit risk of borrowers, as they expect to hold the asset to maturity. However, the loan originators', typically a Bank's, reward is structured so that as more loans are made and sold wholesale, more commission will be earned. So there is little need for bank originators to monitor their borrowers' credit risk. The monitoring was the responsibility of the end investor in the securitised tranches and, theoretically, the rating agencies.
