40|$|The article {{looks at}} Opinion 1 / 13 {{and the broader}} {{implications}} of the Lisbon Treaty for EU external relations competence and procedures. Two novel substantive issues are discussed. The first is {{the potential impact of}} the catalogue of competences in the Lisbon Treaty, and the codification of the doctrine of implied powers in Articles 3 (2) TFEU and 216 (1) TFEU. Has the Lisbon Treaty managed to reinstate the Member States as "masters of the Treaties" that can not only "codify" and "contain" but even "reverse" case law of the ECJ on EU external competence? The second is how far can the EU take part in "setting the international scene", in an extra-EU context. Should the outcome be different according to the subject matter, or the nature of EU competence?

The US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective study used two methods to assess DILI causality: a structured expert opinion process and the Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). Causality assessment focused on detailed clinical and laboratory data from patients with suspected DILI. The adjudication process used standardized numerical and descriptive definitions and scored cases as definite, highly likely, probable, possible, or unlikely. Results of the structured expert <b>opinion</b> <b>procedure</b> were compared with those derived by the RUCAM approach. Among 250 patients with suspected DILI, the expert opinion adjudication process scored 78 patients (31 %) as definite, 102 (41 %) as highly likely, 37 (15 %) as probable, 25 (10 %) as possible, and 8 (3 %) as unlikely. Among 187 enrollees who had received a single implicated drug, initial complete agreement was reached for 50 (27 %) with the expert opinion process and for 34 (19 %) with a five-category RUCAM scale (P = 0. 08), and the two methods demonstrated a modest correlation with each other (Spearman's r = 0. 42, P = 0. 0001). Importantly, the RUCAM approach substantially shifted the causality likelihood toward lower probabilities {{in comparison with the}} DILIN expert opinion process. Conclusion : The structured DILIN expert opinion process produced higher agreement rates and likelihood scores than RUCAM in assessing causality, but there was still considerable interobserver variability in both. Accordingly, a more objective, reliable, and reproducible means of assessing DILI causality is still needed. H EPATOLOGY 201...|$|E

Bc. Jiří Trunda Summary: This Bachelor Thesis is focused on studying {{the influence of the}} replacement of a kindergarten's director on its culture and on the {{character of}} the employees' expectations regarding the new director. In its theoretical part the thesis is aimed at describing and defining its main topics, i. e. school culture and the influence of management replacement on school culture. School culture does not change only with time or with the changes of the outside environment. The replacement of the director may significantly change both the internal and external views of the school's existing culture. The degree of the organization's employees' satisfaction as well as their <b>opinions,</b> <b>procedures,</b> working conditions, etc. are important parts of the school's culture, which change when the management is changed. The research part of the thesis describes the employees' expectations after the director of the observed nursery has been replaced and their attitude to the change.
