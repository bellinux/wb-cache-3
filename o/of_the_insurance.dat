5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurance</b> company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud.
