50|$|Fodder in {{the form}} <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> and legumes can be grown in small and large quantities. Systems have been {{developed}} recently that allow for many tons of sprouts to be produced each day, year round. Sprouted grains can greatly increase the nutritional value of the grain compared with feeding the ungerminated grain to stock. In addition, they use less water than traditional forage, making them ideal for drought conditions. Sprouted barley and other cereal grains can be grown hydroponically in a carefully controlled environment. Under hydroponic conditions, sprouted fodder at 150 mm tall with a 50 mm root mat is at its peak for animal feed. Although products such are barley are grain, when sprouted they are approved by the American Grassfed Association {{to be used as}} livestock feed.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the general level of dormancy in 375 wheat genotypes and influence of seed colour on that level. Sprouting is in negative correlation with the level of dormancy. Germination tests were carried out during three periods (at harvest, 45 and 90 days after the harvest) Seed colour of all genotypes was determined visually. It is determined significant correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> at the harvest and 45 days after the harvest and between the number <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> 45 days after the harvest and 90 days after the harvest. Significant, negative correlation was determined between the number <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains</b> at the harvest and seed colour (Tab. 3). At the harvest, 52. 3 % genotypes were very dormant. Very high percent of sprouting had 8. 8 % genotypes. Forty five days after the harvest, only five genotypes were dormant. At the third sampling time all genotypes were non dormant. Although it was determined significant, negative correlation between seed colour and sprouting at the harvest, red grains are not always dormant. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{promising}} {{direction of}} innovative technologies in bakery is {{the production of}} bread {{with the use of}} wheat germ (Triticumaestivum L.), in which all the nutrients incorporated into the grain by nature are rationally used. Germination of grain is accompanied by a significant increase in its antioxidant capacity, which makes it advisable to use <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> in food formulas, not only to increase nutritional value and enrichment with dietary fiber, but also to slow down the rancidity of food lipids. The practical significance of the research is the creation of innovative technology to produce a new bakery product using germinated wheat grains (Triticumaestivum L.). The analysis of the existing market <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> and prospects <b>of</b> its development, the analysis of consumers' information regarding <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> was carried out. The rational regimes of germination of wheat (Triticumaestivum L.), allowing to obtain an additive in the formulation of bakery products with maximum biological activity, are determined. It is shown that the length <b>of</b> <b>sprouts</b> <b>of</b> germinated seeds used in this recipe should not exceed 2 mm. It was found that under the selected germination conditions, the shoots reach the required length within 48 hours of germination. Thus, in spite of a slight difference in price, the products will be in demand and be competitive in the market of bread and bakery products. In the food industry, there is an opportunity to bring to the market a new category of functional foods that have not only high nutritional value, but also the ability to improve health and reduce the risk of diseases...|$|R

40|$|When rain or a {{combination}} of rain and high humidity delay wheat harvest, losses can occur in grain yield and/or grain quality. Yield losses can result from shattering, from reduction in test weight, {{and in the case of}} windrowed <b>grain,</b> from rooting <b>of</b> <b>sprouting</b> <b>grain</b> at the soil: windrow contact. Losses in grain quality can result from reduction in test weight and from sprouting. Sprouting causes a degradation of grain proteins and starches, hence flour quality is reduced, and the grain price deteriorates to the value of feed grain. Although losses in grain yield and quality are rain-induced, these losses do not necessarily occur because a standing or windrowed crop is wetted by rain. Spike water concentration in hard red spring wheat must be increased to about 45 - 49 % before sprouting is initiated in grain that has overcome dormancy. The time required to overcome this dormancy after the cultivar has dried to 12 to 14 % water concentration differs with hard red spring cultivars. The effect of rain on threshing-ready standing and windrowed hard red spring wheat grain yeild and quality was evaluated. A goal was to develop the capability to forecast the extent of expected loss of grain yield and quality from specific climatic events that delay threshing...|$|R

50|$|The {{utilization}} of microbial-cultured starches {{to generate a}} fermentation {{has a long history}} in Asian countries, as seen by the large diversity of foods and beverages produced. Brewing alcoholic beverages from grains typically involves the use <b>of</b> <b>sprouted</b> cereal <b>grains</b> that supply natural enzymes to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The ensuing liquid obtained is fermented by microbes and turned into an alcoholic drink. As the grains used for traditional Asian alcoholic fermentations are raw and unsprouted (read unmalted), the enzymes responsible for the conversion of carbohydrates to fermentable sugars are absent and thus fermentation cannot proceed. Culturing microbes on cereal grains is a time-honoured tradition from Asia and the necessary way around this dilemma, as they exude the enzymes that allow liquefaction and saccharification to occur (up to fifty different enzymes have been isolated from Aspergillus oryzae starters). Their mutualistic symbiosis with fermentative yeast and bacteria initiates the complex saccharification-liquefaction-fermentation process to produce the sought after alcoholic liquid.|$|R

The levels of the enzymes were estimated in the whole dry grains, 24 h steeped, 24 h sprouted and 48 h <b>sprouted</b> <b>grains.</b> A combined statistical analysis of linear regression and analysis of variance were used to test for enzyme interaction, similarities and interspecific relationship between the cereals. The estimated interspecific relationship between sorghum and barley was 84 % based on the three enzymes, while millet had 75 %. All the sprouted cereals {{with the exception of the}} standard barley had high lipase levels. This possibly suggests certain limitations as regards to production of off-flavours. Malt prepared from maize, sorghum, rice and millet had comparable protease levels with barley (P> 0. 05). The malts prepared from maize, millet, rice, sorghum and wheat had comparatively low alpha-amylase levels when compared with the standard barley.
