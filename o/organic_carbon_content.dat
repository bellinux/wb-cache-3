25|$|Soils {{with high}} clay {{contents}} or small particle sizes and high total <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> {{have been shown}} to promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include reduction of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form dimers. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.|$|E

A 2015 study of foreshore sediments from the Thames estuary measured total mercury at 0.01 to 12.07mg/kg with mean of 2.10mg/kg and median of 0.85mg/kg (n=351). The highest mercury concentrations [...] were shown to occur {{in and around the}} city of London in association with fine grain muds and high total <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content.</b> The strong affinity of mercury for carbon rich sediments has also been observed in salt marsh sediments of the River Mersey mean of 2mg/kg up to 5mg/kg.

30|$|Organic matter {{contents}} {{has been}} processed by vermicomposting and/or by composting from the organic flora raw material, fauna including partially decomposed dead living entities like earthworm and micro to macrobial niche (Jack et al. 2011). This mineralization mechanism {{of organic matter}} produces partially to fully decompose <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> improves the soil structure, friability, water holding capacity, porosity, tillage, soil fertility which in turn contributes in boosting up the yield of all crops. Our study suggested the suitable quantum of mineralized <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> through the implementation of vermicomposting technologies when compared with non-vermicomposting technologies (Table  3). This paradox has been significantly verified by the recommendations of research advancement.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of soil sample preservation methods on dissolved nitrogen and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> in Dutch grassland soils fertilized with improved cattle slurry manure quality by comparing the analytical results of soil samples preserved moist at- 4 oC in cold room and the same soil samples preserved after oven dried at 40 oC for 48 hours. The results revealed that soil sample preservation methods influenced dissolved mineral nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> of the soils. Dissolved mineral nitrogen (nitrate-N and ammonium-N), organic nitrogen and dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> were higher in soil samples preserved after oven drying. Moreover, the initial field soil moisture contents affected the dissolved mineral and organic nitrogen as well as dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> of the soils. Therefore, the analytical result of soil sample preservation on oven dry basis does not represent the soil population from which the soils samples were originally taken from. Hence, it is not recommended to dry soil samples before analysis as alternative to moist soil samples preservation for analysis. Keywords...|$|R
2500|$|Concentrations of PAH in {{river and}} estuarine sediments vary {{according}} {{to a variety of}} factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as tidal regime which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth. Understanding of sediment hosted PAH in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (e.g. mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAH can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism. River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10 to 60cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH. Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163µg/kg (dry weight sediment) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3766µg/kg in the River Mersey. In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural total <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> (TOC) tend to accumulate PAH due to high sorption capacity of organic matter. A similar correspondence between PAH and TOC has also been observed in the sediments of tropical mangroves located on the coast of South China ...|$|E

40|$|Past {{changes in}} sea-surface {{productivity}} in the Oyashio Current are evaluated {{on the basis}} of abundances of biological constituents in sediments from Leg 186 sites. <b>Organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> at Sites 1150 and 1151 are moderate (0. 5 to 1. 5 wt%) and have an algal origin as indicated by low C/N ratios (< 10) and by carbon isotopic compositions ranging from - 23. 4 to - 21. 3. A decreasing trend in <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents,</b> <b>carbon</b> isotope ratios, and C/N ratios occurs with depth at both sites, probably as a consequence of diagenetic degradation of organic matter.

Similar results have been reported for sites in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean for the same time interval.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of precipitation and age of waste on the stabilization of the dumped waste. Landfill gas samples at 1 -m depth were collected from 13 waste landfill sites in Sri Lanka with different annual precipitation ranging from 1, 000 to 4, 000 mm and waste age ranging from 1 to 120 months. Typical landfill gases O 2, N 2, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured quantitatively by a gas chromatograph. Buried waste samples at 1 -m depth were also taken from all locations to determine <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> in the residue (< 2 mm). With the age of wastes, the measured O 2 and N 2 concentration (ranged in 1 - 20 % and 2 - 80 % respectively) in collected landfill gas samples were increased and the CH 4 and CO 2 concentration (ranged in 0 - 60 % and 1 - 68 %, respectively) decreased, implying the buried wastes are getting stabilized within 120 months after dumped (typically in several decades in mid-latitude regions). However, the correlations between measured gas concentrations and the annual precipitations at the sampling site show no definite results. <b>Organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> in the waste residues (ranged in 24 - 236 mg g- 1) were not fully related to the waste age and the precipitation amount, while significant time-dependent decreases of the <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>contents</b> can be observed in some investigated landfill sites.

50|$|In some stratigraphic sequences, {{there is}} clearly a {{variation}} in color between different strata.

5000|$|If the {{sedimentation}} rate is low (about 1 cm/yr), the <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> is low (about 1% [...] ), and oxygen is abundant, aerobic bacteria can use {{up all the}} organic matter in the sediments faster than oxygen is depleted, so lower-energy electron acceptors are not used. But where {{sedimentation rate}}s and the <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> are high, which is typically the case on continental shelves and beneath western boundary current upwelling zones, the pore water in the sediments becomes anoxic at depths {{of only a few}} centimeters or less. In such organic-rich marine sediments, sulfate then becomes the most important terminal electron acceptor due to its high concentration in seawater, although it too is depleted by a depth of centimeters to meters. Below this, methane is produced. This production of methane is a rather complicated process, requiring a highly reducing environment (Eh −350 to −450 mV) and a pH between 6 and 8, as well as a complex syntrophic consortia of different varieties of archaea and bacteria, although it is only archaea that actually emit methane.|$|E

The dispersal of pollutants is essentially controlled by diffusion from point sources (city, port and WWTP) and is limited to Volos Bay.
