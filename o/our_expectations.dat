John M Armleder (CH), Rashid Johnson (USA) & Dirk Skreber (D) come from very different backgrounds, working visually, conceptually, even ideologically very differently, but all challenge <b>our</b> <b>expectations</b> {{of what a}} painting can, feel and look like.|$|E
25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates <b>our</b> <b>expectations,</b> we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E
25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we might know as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer <b>our</b> <b>Expectations.</b>|$|E

500|$|Our {{reception}} exceeded <b>our</b> <b>expectations.</b> [...] We {{found nothing}} but civility, elegance, and plenty. [...] After the usual refreshments, {{and the usual}} conversation, the evening came upon us. [...] The carpet was then rolled off the floor; the musician was called, and the whole company was invited to dance, nor did ever fairies trip with greater alacrity. [...] The general air of festivity, which predominated in this place, so far remote from all those regions which the mind {{has been used to}} contemplate as the mansions of pleasure, struck the imagination with a delightful surprise, analogous to that which is felt at an unexpected emersion from darkness into light.|$|E
500|$|The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner [...] "one of Hollywood's {{very best}} {{directors}} of comedy", {{and said that}} it was [...] "most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills <b>our</b> <b>expectations.</b> But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan." [...] In a review for The New York Times, Caryn James called When Harry Met Sally... an [...] "often funny but amazingly hollow film" [...] that [...] "romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers"; James characterized it as [...] "the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu".|$|E
500|$|In limited {{release and}} playing in only seven theaters in Los Angeles and New York City, Juno grossed $420,113 over its debut weekend, {{averaging}} $60,016 per screen. When Juno became Fox Searchlight's first film to surpass $100 {{million at the}} box office, the company's president Peter Rice issued the statement: [...] "This is an astonishing feat for us and the film has surpassed all <b>our</b> <b>expectations.</b> We knew this film had crossover potential and it has resonated with audiences all across the country." [...] The film has grossed $143,495,265 in the United States and $87,916,319 in other territories for a total worldwide gross of $231,411,584. It was also the highest-grossing of the five Best Picture nominees for the 80th Academy Awards.|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} week, the show had already gained over 18 million viewers, beating out ABC's show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in ratings. After the season finale, Carter said that Survivor [...] "built over a 13-week run {{to what was}} {{expected}} last night {{to be the biggest}} single television audience ever assembled for a summer television series, far eclipsed every expectation the network had when it acquired the rights to the show last year." [...] Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television said that [...] "it has beaten <b>our</b> <b>expectations</b> by about double." [...] The finale of Survivor was watched by 51.7 million viewers, the second-highest viewership of any American television episode during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, exceeded only by the finale of Friends. The finale had higher ratings than the World Series, NBA finals, NCAA men's basketball finals, and Grammy Awards of that year. CBS was able to make the cost of commercial advertisers up to $600,000 during the season finale.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mail {{cited as a}} [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "hilarious" [...] episode, and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "a terrific episode, full of wit and sly digs at <b>our</b> <b>expectations</b> of Homer's abilities. The fact that he invents things that other people find useful (and steal the credit for) is both amusing and a little sad. Poor Homer." [...] Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "though 'Wizard' borders on 'Homer’s wacky scheme' territory, his attempts {{to come up with}} something significant offer amusement. At no point does 'Wizard' threaten to become a particularly strong episode, but it entertains to a reasonable degree. I do like the 'Everything’s Okay Alarm' and the makeup gun, though." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the voyage}} Morrell {{experienced}} several {{encounters with the}} slave trade, first at the Cape Verde Islands, then a centre for the trade because of its geographical position {{in relation to the}} Americas, Europe and Africa. He found the slaves' conditions wretched, but was impressed by their passion for music which, he thought, [...] "can alleviate even the pangs caused by the galling fetters of slavery". Later in the voyage he witnessed what he describes as [...] "horrid barbarity", including the spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings. A lengthy soliloquy in his journal on the evils of slavery concludes: [...] "he root, the source, the foundation of the evil is the ignorance and superstition of the poor negroes themselves". On June 8, 1829, Morrell wrote in his journal: [...] "The voyage had been prosperous beyond <b>our</b> <b>expectations,</b> and any further stay on the African coast would have been {{a waste of time and}} money". [...] He arrived in New York on July 14.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on Parker and Stone's {{elaborate}} April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of Newsday {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship and never came back. The lesson: Pay off <b>our</b> <b>expectations,</b> or you'll be sorry." [...] Jim Minge of the Omaha World-Herald said South Park fans were [...] "duped" [...] by the episode. Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E
500|$|After its release, Evita {{garnered}} critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, [...] "It's {{a relief}} to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds <b>our</b> <b>expectations.</b> She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has {{more than just a}} bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." [...] Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role. She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: [...] "Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public." [...] Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997; she declared that they were [...] "better off as best friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Malcolm Johnson stated, [...] "Against all odds, this long-delayed {{film version}} {{turns out to}} be a labor of love for {{director}} Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing [...] "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, in his review for the Chicago Tribune, wrote, [...] "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." [...] According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, [...] "This Evita is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." [...] Critic Zach Conner commented, [...] "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds <b>our</b> <b>expectations.</b> She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." ...|$|E

500|$|Chang of Variety {{commented that}} it [...] "plays like The Karate Kid with a pro-literacy agenda, pushing {{all the right}} {{emotional}} buttons yet hitting quite a few wrong ones in the process." [...] The Evening Chronicles review said it [...] "conceals few narrative surprises" [...] but contended that [...] "when [...] does finally defy <b>our</b> <b>expectations,</b> it's to ensure his spellers learn a valuable lesson about integrity." [...] Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized that the film [...] "telegraphs its plot"; however, he praised it as [...] "genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational." [...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and said it has [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child." [...] Morris added, [...] "Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's just the kind of propaganda our children need." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} aims {{to explore}} possible relations between firm characteristics, such as business strategies, and ownership patterns as contextual contingent factors and innovative Management Accounting (MA) and Risk Management (RM) techniques. Methodology/approach – The paper {{is based on}} a questionnaire survey. The survey was completed by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) and Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of large Italian manufacturing companies. The sample is selected from a data set (479 firms) from the Industrial, Commerce and Agriculture Confederation (CCIA). The data set captures all Italian companies and includes companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Findings – The results of the statistical analysis indicate that <b>our</b> <b>expectation</b> of a significant relationship between prospector business strategies and integrated Sophisticated Management Accounting (SMA) was not supported by the data. In addition, the results suggest that <b>our</b> <b>expectation</b> of a significant relationship between prospector business strategies and Sophisticated Risk Management (SRM) was not supported by the data. In conclusion, the use of SRM techniques is not influenced by business strategies in large companies in Italy. Finally, the results show that <b>our</b> <b>expectation</b> of a significant relationship between listed firms and SRM was supported by the data. In particular, the tests highlight that there is a significant relationship between listed firms and non-probabilistic risk assessment techniques...|$|R
