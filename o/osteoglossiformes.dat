Consequently, the South American genus Osteoglossum, and the Asian and Australian genus Scleropages are the only extant genera that remain in the osteoglossid family. Arapaimidae and Osteoglossidae split about 220 million years ago (Mya), during the Late Triassic.|$|E

To elucidate the evolutionary history and functional diversification of AR genes in vertebrates, we cloned the AR cDNAs from a shark, basal ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), namely bichir and sturgeon (Acipenseriformes), and teleosts including a basal teleost, arowana (<b>Osteoglossiformes).</b> Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gene duplication event that gave rise to two different teleost ARs (α and β) likely occurred in the actinopterygian lineage leading to teleosts after the divergence of Acipenseriformes but before the split of <b>Osteoglossiformes,</b> which is compatible with the phylogenetic timing of teleost-specific genome duplication. Searching for AR genes in the medaka genome indicated that the teleost AR gene duplication has been associated with the duplication between chromosomes 10 and 14. Our functional analysis revealed that the shark AR activates the target gene via androgen response element by classical androgens. The teleost ARα showed the unique intracellular localization with a significantly higher transactivating capacity than that by teleost ARβ. These findings indicate that the most ancient type of AR, as activated by the classical androgens as ligands, emerged before the Chondrichthyes-Osteichthyes split, and the AR gene was duplicated during the teleost-specific genome duplication event.

40|$|Background: Based on the {{observation}} of an increased number of paralogous genes in teleost fishes compared with other vertebrates and on the conserved synteny between duplicated copies, {{it has been shown}} that a whole genome duplication (WGD) occurred during the evolution of Actinopterygian fish. Comparative phylogenetic dating of this duplication event suggests that it occurred early on, specifically in teleosts. It has been proposed that this event might have facilitated the evolutionary radiation and the phenotypic diversification of the teleost fish, notably by allowing the sub- or neo-functionalization of many duplicated genes. Results: In this paper, we studied in a wide range of Actinopterygians the duplication and fate of the androgen receptor (AR, NR 3 C 4), a nuclear receptor known to play a key role in sex-determination in vertebrates. The pattern of AR gene duplication is consistent with an early WGD event: it has been duplicated into two genes ARA and AR-B after the split of the Acipenseriformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish but before the divergence of <b>Osteoglossiformes.</b> Genomic and syntenic analyses in addition to lack of PCR amplification show that one of the duplicated copies, AR-B, was lost in several basal Clupeocephala such as Cypriniformes (including the model species zebrafish), Siluriformes, Characiformes and Salmoniformes. Interestingly, we also found that, in basal teleost fish (<b>Osteoglossiformes</b> and Anguilliformes), the two copies remain very similar, whereas, specifically in Percomorphs, one of the copies, AR-B, has accumulated substitutions in both the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the DNA binding domain (DBD). Conclusion: The comparison of the mutations present in these divergent AR-B with those known in human to be implicated in complete, partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome suggests that the existence of two distinct AR duplicates may be correlated to specific functional differences that may be connected to the well-known plasticity of sex determination in fish. This suggests that three specific events have shaped the present diversity of ARs in Actinopterygians: (i) early WGD, (ii) parallel loss of one duplicate in several lineages and (iii) putative neofunctionalization of the same duplicate in percomorphs, which occurred a long time after the WGD...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For many genes, ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) {{have two}} paralogous copies, where only one {{ortholog}} {{is present in}} tetrapods. The discovery of an additional, almost-complete set of Hox clusters in teleosts (zebrafish, pufferfish, medaka, and cichlid) but not in basal actinopterygian lineages (Polypterus) led to the formulation of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. The phylogenetic timing of this genome duplication during the evolution of rayfinned fish is unknown, since only a few species of basal fish lineages have been investigated so far. In this study, three nuclear genes (fzd 8, sox 11, tyrosinase) were sequenced from sturgeons (Acipenseriformes), gars (Semionotiformes), bony tongues (Osteoglossomorpha), and a tenpounder (Elopomorpha). For these three genes, two copies have been described previously teleosts (e. g., zebrafish, pufferfish), but only one orthologous copy is found in tetrapods.

40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondrial DNA-derived {{sequences}} {{have become}} popular markers for evolutionary studies, as their comparison may yield significant {{insights into the}} evolution of both the organisms and their genomes. From the more than 24, 000 teleost species, only 254 complete mtDNA sequences are available (GenBank status on 06 Sep 2006). In this paper, we report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Asian arowana, a basal bonytongue fish species, which belongs {{to the order of}} <b>Osteoglossiformes.</b> Results The complete mitochondrial genomic sequence (mtDNA) of Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) was determined by using shotgun sequencing method. The length of Asian arowana mtDNA is ca. 16, 650 bp (its variation is due to polymorphic repeats in the control region), containing 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes. Twelve of the thirteen protein coding genes were found to be encoded by the heavy strand in the order typically observed for vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, whereas only nad 6 was located on the light strand. An interesting feature of Asian arowana mitogenome is that two different repeat arrays were identified in the control region: a 37 bp tandem repeat at the 5 ' end and an AT-type dinucleotide microsatellite at the 3 ' end. Both repeats show polymorphism among the six individuals tested; moreover the former one is present in the mitochondrial genomes of several other teleost groups. The TACAT motif described earlier only from mammals and lungfish was found in the tandem repeat of several osteoglossid and eel species. Phylogenetic analysis of fish species representing Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii taxa has shown that the Asian arowana is located near the baseline of the teleost tree, confirming its status among the ancestral teleost lineages. Conclusion The mitogenome of Asian arowana is very similar to the typical vertebrate mitochondrial genome in terms of gene arrangements, codon usage and base composition. However its control region contains two different types of repeat units at both ends, an interesting feature that to our knowledge has never been reported before for other vertebrate mitochondrial control regions. Phylogenetic analysis using the complete mtDNA sequence of Asian arowana confirmed that it belongs to an ancestral teleost lineage. </p...|$|E
