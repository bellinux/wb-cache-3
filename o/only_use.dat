Those adapters include PET (normally <b>only</b> <b>used</b> on the PET/CBM2), Hummer (normally <b>only</b> <b>used</b> on the C64DTV) and OEM (normally <b>only</b> <b>used</b> on the VIC20). There are probably no game supporting those adapters on the C64.|$|R

5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would <b>only</b> <b>use</b> critical moral thinking and the other of whom would <b>only</b> <b>use</b> intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may <b>only</b> <b>use</b> their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E

50|$|Cryogenic {{distillation}} {{is typically}} <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for very high volumes {{because of its}} nonlinear cost-scale relationship, which makes the process more economical at larger scales. Because of this it is typically <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for air separation.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could <b>only</b> <b>use</b> a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} <b>only</b> <b>use</b> nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the <b>only</b> <b>use</b> of nuclear weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E

5|$|Manufacturers of {{personal}} electronic devices might {{not include a}} USB standard connector on their product for technical or marketing reasons. Some manufacturers provide proprietary cables that permit their devices to physically connect to a USB standard port. Full functionality of proprietary ports and cables with USB standard ports is not assured; for example, some devices <b>only</b> <b>use</b> the USB connection for battery charging and do not implement any data transfer functions.|$|E
5|$|Medic: The Medic-class characters' main {{technique}} is replenishing {{the health of}} team members. Medics are also equipped with a damage dealing weapon. Some Medics also have the abilities to revive teammates that are incapacitated or killed by the Monster.

5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set {{fully in}} the minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major chord, marking the <b>only</b> <b>use</b> of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2006acquisition of the Cherry Springs airport, a new Public Programming {{field has}} been {{established}} on the former airstrip. This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may <b>only</b> <b>use</b> flashlights with red filters, and may only point them at the ground. The Astronomy Field has further restrictions on lights, {{and parts of the}} park are light-free zones.|$|E
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could <b>only</b> <b>use</b> computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} {{made sure}} that the 2035 underground world would <b>only</b> <b>use</b> pre-1996 technology {{as a means to}} depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E

5|$|The {{second major}} {{milestone}} (after version 1.0) in Epiphany development was the 2.14 release. This {{was the first}} Epiphany release which followed GNOME's version numbering. It also featured network awareness using NetworkManager, smart bookmarks-related improvements {{and the possibility of}} being compiled against XULRunner. The latter was critical, as previously Epiphany could <b>only</b> <b>use</b> Firefox or Mozilla/SeaMonkey as a layout engine provider, so it could only be installed alongside one of those browsers. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the sole web browser on the system.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can <b>only</b> <b>use</b> his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E
