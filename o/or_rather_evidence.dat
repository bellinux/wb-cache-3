The issue is to isolate the observable implications for the data of being an incomplete discrete sample from a continuous-time diffusion. This paper's answer relies on testing a necessary and sufficient restriction on the conditional densities of diffusions, at the sampling interval of the observed data. This restriction characterizes the continuity of the unobservable complete sample path...|$|E
40|$|Asset returns have {{traditionally}} been modeled in the literature as following continuous-time Markov processes, {{and in many cases}} diffusions. Can discretely sampled financial rate data help us decide which continuous-time models are sensible? Diffusion processes are characterized by the continuity of their sample paths. This cannot be verified from the discrete sample path: by nature, even if the underlying sample path were continuous, the discretely sampled data will always appear as a sequence of discrete jumps. Instead, this paper relies on a characterization of the transition density of the discrete data to determine whether the discontinuities observed in the discrete data are the result of the discreteness of sampling, <b>or</b> <b>rather</b> <b>evidence</b> of genuine jump dynamics for the underlying continuous-time process. I then focus on the implications of this approach for option pricing models. ...|$|E

IN MANY INSTANCES IN FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS, we make inference about a postulated continuous-time model on the basis of discretely sampled observations. Among potential continuous-time models, most specifications adopted have been diffusions, although the literature is more and more frequently allowing for jumps ~see Merton ~ 1976 !, Ahn and Thompson ~ 1988 !, Bates ~ 1991 !, Das and Foresi ~ 1996 !, Duffie, Pan, and Singleton ~ 2000 !, Aït...|$|E

40|$|Validity {{refers to}} {{the degree to which}} an {{assessment}} actually measures what it claims to measure and well serves intended purposes. From this perspective, assessments themselves are not valid <b>or</b> not; <b>rather</b> <b>evidence</b> of validity must be established in the context of specific interpretations and uses of test scores. A test may be well suited for one use and not for another. For example, a mathematics test appropriate for accountability or summative purposes may not well serve formative assessment purposes for teachers. Moreover, validity is a matter of degree; validation requires the accumulation of evidence to support the argument that scores derived from a given test yield accurate inferences to support intended interpretations and uses (AERA, APA, NCME, 1999; Kane, 2001). Finally, our validity definition requires consideration of both (1) what is measured—tha...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Occlusion {{and lack}} of {{visibility}} in crowded and cluttered scenes {{make it difficult to}} track individual people correctly and consistently, particularly in a single view. We present a multiview approach to solve this problem. In our approach, we neither detect nor track objects from any single camera <b>or</b> camera pair; <b>rather,</b> <b>evidence</b> is gathered from all of the cameras into a synergistic framework and detection and tracking results are propagated back to each view. Unlike other multiview approaches that require fully calibrated views, our approach is purely image-based and uses only 2 D constructs. To this end, we develop a planar homographic occupancy constraint that fuses foreground likelihood information from multiple views to resolve occlusions and localize people on a reference scene plane. For greater robustness, this process is extended to multiple planes parallel to the reference plane in the framework of plane to plane homologies. Our fusion methodology also models scene clutter using the Schmieder and Weathersby clutter measure, which acts as a confidence prior, to assign higher fusion weight to views with lesser clutter. Detection and tracking are performed simultaneously by graph cuts segmentation of tracks in the space-time occupancy likelihood data. Experimental results with detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis are demonstrated in challenging multiview crowded scenes. Index Terms—Tracking, sensor fusion, graph-theoretic methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In northwestern North America, glaciers figure {{prominently}} in both indigenous oral traditions and narratives of geophysical sciences. These perspectives intersect in discussions about global warming, predicted to be extreme at Arctic and Subarctic latitudes and {{an area of}} concern for both local people and scientists. Indigenous people in northwestern North America have experienced climate variability associated with the latter phases of the Little Ice Age (approximately 1550 – 1850). This paper draws on oral traditions passed down from that period, some recorded between 1900 and the early 1950 s in coastal Alaska Tlingit communities and others recorded more recently with elders from Yukon First Nations. The narratives concern human travel to the Gulf of Alaska foreshore {{at the end of}} the Little Ice Age from the Copper River, from the Alaska panhandle, and from the upper Alsek-Tatshenshini drainage, as well as observations about glacier advances, retreats, and surges. The paper addresses two large policy debates. One concerns the incorporation of local knowledge into scientific research. The second addresses the way in which oral tradition contributes another variety of historical understanding in areas of the world where written documents are relatively recent. Academic debates, whether in science or in history, too often evaluate local expertise as data <b>or</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>rather</b> than as knowledge or theory that might contribute different perspectives to academic questions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the European Union s Committee of Permanent Representatives, or COREPER, a group composed of the EU permanent representatives (permreps) and responsible for preparing upcoming ministerial meetings of the Council. As the heart of everyday decision making in the EU, COREPER is a key laboratory to test whether and how national officials become socialized into a Brussels-based collective culture and what difference this makes for EU negotiations. The key scope conditions for COREPER socialization are high issue density intensity and insulation from domestic politics. COREPER also displays a range of socialization mechanisms, including strategic calculation, role playing, and normative suasion. Based on extensive interview data and a detailed case study of negotiations for a controversial EU citizenship directive, this article documents a socialization pathway in COREPER marked by adherence {{to a set of}} norm-guided rules and principled beliefs in collectively legitimating arguments and making decisions. COREPER socialization does not indicate a pattern of national identities being replaced <b>or</b> subsumed; <b>rather,</b> the <b>evidence</b> points to a socialization process based on a logic of appropriateness and an expanded conception of the self.

40|$|We {{study the}} time {{variation}} of the apparent flux of cosmological point sources due to the transient weak lensing by dark matter microhaloes. Assuming a transverse motion of microhaloes with respect to our line of sight, we derive the correspondence between the temporal power spectrum of the weak lensing magnification, and the spatial power spectrum of density on small scales. Considering different approximations for the small scale structure of dark matter, we predict the apparent magnitude of cosmological point sources to vary {{by as much as}} 10 ^- 4 - 10 ^- 3, due to this effect, within a period of a few months. This red photometric noise has an almost perfect gaussian statistics, to one part in ∼ 10 ^ 4. We also compare the transient weak lensing power spectrum with the background effects such as the stellar microlensing on cosmological scales. A quasar lensed by a galaxy or cluster like SDSSJ 1004 + 4112 strong lensing system, with multiple images, is a suitable system for this study as: (i) using the time-delay method between different images, we can remove the intrinsic variations of the quasar, and (ii) strong lensing enhances signals from the transient weak lensing. We also require the images to form at large angular separations {{from the center of the}} lensing structure, in order to minimize contamination by the stellar microlensing. With long-term monitoring of quasar strong lensing systems with a 10 -meter class telescope, we can examine the existence of dark microhaloes as the building blocks of dark matter structures. Failure to detect this signal may either be caused by a breakdown of cold dark matter (CDM) hierarchy on small scales, <b>or</b> <b>rather</b> interpreted as <b>evidence</b> against CDM paradigm, e. g. in favor of modified gravity models.
