30|$|One {{research}} {{question is whether}} the decreased energy dependency in a climate change mitigation scenario, such as the 2 -degree scenario, implies a higher material, specifically metal ores dependency of the EU 28. To answer this, we use the environmental stressors of used and unused domestic extraction of fossil fuels and metals, see Additional file 1 : Table SI 4 for a detailed list. The stressor data in EXIOBASE are based on data from materialflows.net as described in Stadler et al. (2018) which records the annual usage of twelve groups of metal ores: iron, bauxite, copper, lead, nickel, gold, <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> ores, platinum group metals (PGM), silver, tin, uranium and thorium, and zinc. EXIOBASE provides estimates of the ore quantities (rather than quantity of metal in the ore), in line with material flow accounting standards and conventions, and additionally provides estimates for the amount of “unused extraction” such as mining overburden. The metal ore stressors are directly linked to the extraction sectors in EXIOBASE, not the non-extracting manufacturing or service industries where a change in the energy or material intensity can be modelled with an s-curve. This implies that the resource extraction only changes with the changes in the intermediate demand that stem from the changes in the energy system. No additional material/resource productivity enhancements, as for example those described in Aguilar-Hernandez et al. (2018), are modelled. We make the strong assumption that the amount of materials extracted per unit of output of the corresponding industries does not change over time (i.e. that ore quality does not change). Therefore, when analysing the results, we clearly see the indirect impacts on fossil fuel and metal extraction due to the change of the energy system implied by going from the 6 -degree scenario to the 2 -degree scenario. Questions about declining metal contents of ores can then be investigated separately.|$|E

Unlike <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> whose origins are lost {{in the midst of the}} time, aluminium was a new and high technology material. On the one hand, the international aluminium market was prematurely born as global, in spite of the national legal monopolies that derived from patents on its technology. On the other hand, aluminium escaped from the control of the traders, such as Metallgesellschaft or Aron Hirsch & Sohne, that characterised the global trade of <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals.</b> The early aluminium market was developed through a specific marketing activity: the competitive edge of thus metal became the price stability, which was chosen by the producers to make aluminium different from <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in raw {{material}} and product prices have caused manufacturers and consumers to experience serious losses in steel sector {{as well as}} in all other sectors. As the number of manufacturers of commodities like coking coal, iron ore and scrap- the main {{raw material}}s of steel manufacturing- is less worldwide and their manufacturers do not want to disclose price in an organized market, their future transaction volumes have not developed sufficiently yet. However, future transaction volumes of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> like aluminum, tin etc. that are used as auxiliary raw materials in steel manufacturing have increased fast in organized markets and such style of future transactions have become important in steel manufacturing in terms of cost management. The London Metal Exchange, one of the leading future commodity markets of world, has an important place in management of price risk in steel manufacturing and consumption of derivative transaction contracts. In this study, causality relationship between the price series of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> used as raw materials in steel manufacturing is examined by using Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test procedure. Empirical results suggest that aluminum is Granger cause of the <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R

50|$|Helium {{is lighter}} than air; larger flow rates are required. It is an inert gas, not {{reacting}} with the molten metals. Its thermal conductivity is high. It {{is not easy}} to ionize, requiring higher voltage to start the arc. Due to higher ionization potential it produces hotter arc at higher voltage, provides wide deep bead; this is an advantage for aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other gases are often added. Blends of helium with addition of 5-10% of argon and 2-5% of carbon dioxide ("tri-mix") can be used for welding of stainless steel. Used also for aluminium and <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> especially for thicker welds. In comparison with argon, helium provides more energy-rich but less stable arc. Helium and carbon dioxide were the first shielding gases used, since the beginning of World War 2. Helium is used as a shield gas in laser welding for carbon dioxide lasers. Helium is more expensive than argon and requires higher flow rates, so despite its advantages {{it may not be a}} cost-effective choice for higher-volume production. Pure helium is not used for steel, as it then provides erratic arc and encourages spatter.|$|R

For this purpose, control groups of animals were selected at a different distance from the Severonikel' industrial complex which is considered as the largest metallurgical company in Europe. It produces nickel, copper and <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals.</b> The study sites were located at 4 – 30 km from the local source of industrial pollution. The analysis of population dynamics, faunistic structure and biological parameters of mass species of Soricidae, Myomorpha has revealed the differences in habitats depending on {{the distance to the}} industrial complex. The results of the chemical analysis of organs and tissue samples of small rodents, their morpho-physiological and genetic characteristics within emission plume were analysed. The abundance of the studied Mammalia species was the lowest at 5 km north and 7 km south of the metallurgical industrial complex. According to our results, animals in a zone of increased industrial emission (sulfur dioxide, compounds of heavy metals) concentrations had more deviations from the biological norms in comparison with the same species from less polluted areas. Long-term (1936 – 2014) abundance dynamics of Clethrionomys glareolus was presented due to the new ecological situation in the region and reduction of the volume of sulfur dioxide emission by the Severonikel' industrial complex. This biotesting method using mammals as study objects may be applied for the definition of ecologically safe level criteria of heavy metal production and it may be used in studies of similar ecological situations...|$|R
