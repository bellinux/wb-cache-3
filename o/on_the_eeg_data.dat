40|$|Purpose: Research {{popularity}} and scope {{for the application}} of transcranial direct current stimulation have been steadily increasing yet many fundamental questions remain unanswered. We sought to determine if anodal stimulation of either hemisphere leads to improved performance of the contralateral hand and/or altered function of the ipsilateral hand, or affects movement preparation, in older subjects. Method: In this cross-over, double blind, sham controlled study, 34 healthy aged participants (age range 40 - 86) were randomised to receive 20 minutes of stimulation to either the dominant or non-dominant motor cortex. The primary outcome was functional performance of both upper limbs measured by the Jebsen Taylor Test and hand grip strength. Additionally, we measured motor preparation using electrophysiological (EEG) recordings. Results: Anodal stimulation resulted in statistically significantly improved performance of the non-dominant hand (p 0. 05). This effect occurred irrespective of the hemisphere stimulated. Stimulation did not produce significant effects on measures of gross function, grip strength, reaction times, or electrophysiological measures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data.</b> Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the hemispheres respond differently to anodal stimulation and the response appears to be task specific but not mediated by age. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

This is important if the causes of <b>the</b> MEG/ <b>EEG</b> signals {{differ from those of}} the fMRI signal. Furthermore, each suprathreshold fMRI cluster is treated as a separate prior, which is important if fMRI data reflect neural activity arising at different times within the EEG/MEG data. We present methodological considerations when mapping from a 3 D fMRI Statistical Parametric Map to a 2 D cortical surface and thence to the covariance components used within our Parametric Empirical Bayesian framework.

40|$|The task of discriminating {{the motor}} imagery of {{different}} movements {{within the same}} limb using electroencephalography (EEG) signals is challenging because these imaginary movements have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. There is, however, a pressing need to succeed in this task. The {{reason is that the}} ability to classify different same-limb imaginary movements could increase the number of control dimensions of a brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, we propose a 3 -class BCI system that discriminates EEG signals corresponding to rest, imaginary grasp movements, and imaginary elbow movements. Besides, the differences between simple motor imagery and goal-oriented motor imagery in terms of their topographical distributions and classification accuracies are also being investigated. To the best of our knowledge, both problems have not been explored in the literature.

Methods: 5 normal-hearing adults participated in this study. The subjects listened attentively to two different speech materials embedded in speech weighted noise at three different SNRs (- 2, - 4 and - 6 dB) while the EEG was being recorded. We determined the envelopes of the clean speech signals, and used them to calculate a decoder that estimates the stimulus envelope based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data.</b> The decoder is based on the principle that the low frequencies (2 - 8 Hz) of the temporal envelope of the stimulus can be linearly related to the EEG. We expressed the correctness of the estimated envelope as a difference measure between the estimated envelope and the envelope of the clean speech signal. Results: In the high-SNR conditions the estimated envelope showed less difference with the envelope of the clean speech stimulus than in the low-SNR conditions, meaning that the stimulus was better represented in the EEG data and thus presumably better understood. Conclusion: Using EEG measurements we are able to estimate the SNR of speech signal in noise presented to the subject. This is the first step towards automatically and objectively estimating speech understanding. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Functional brain {{connectivity}} is {{a marker}} of the brain state. Growing interest in the examination of large-scale brain network functional connectivity dynamics is accompanied by {{an effort to find}} the electrophysiological correlates. The commonly used constraints applied to spatial and spectral domains during EEG data analysis may leave part of the neural activity unrecognized. A proposed approach blindly reveals multimodal EEG spectral patterns that are related to the dynamics of the BOLD functional network connectivity. The blind decomposition of EEG spectrogram by Parallel Factor Analysis {{has been shown to be}} a useful technique for uncovering patterns of neural activity where each pattern contains three signatures (spatial, temporal, and spectral). The decomposition takes into account the trilinear structure of EEG data, as compared to the standard approaches of electrode averaging, electrode subset selection or using standard frequency bands. The simultaneously acquired BOLD fMRI data were decomposed by Independent Component Analysis. Dynamic functional connectivity was computed on the component’s time series using a sliding window correlation, and functional connectivity network states were then defined based on the values of the correlation coefficients. ANOVA tests were performed to assess the relationships between the dynamics of functional connectivity network states and the fluctuations of EEG spectral patterns. Three patterns related to the dynamics of functional connectivity network states were found. Previous findings revealed a relationship between EEG spectral pattern fluctuations and the hemodynamics of large-scale brain networks. This work suggests that the relationship also exists at the level of functional connectivity dynamics among large-scale brain networks when no standard spatial and spectral constraints are applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEG</b> <b>data...</b>|$|E
30|$|Khamis et al. [22] It is {{a single}} channel, patient-specific and with no {{threshold}} parameter method of seizure detection. Frequency domain features like frequency moment signatures are used to distinguish a seizure segment from non-seizure. <b>The</b> <b>EEG</b> signals at hand have marked <b>the</b> collected scalp <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> with seizure events. After marking the signal, a filtering process has been performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windowed <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> from electrode differences T 6 -P 4 (right hemisphere, RH) and T 5 -P 3 (left hemi sphere, RH). Power spectral densities of <b>the</b> signals <b>on</b> both hemispheres have been computed and frequency components of both hemispheres are combined into a single quantity. Signatures are calculated by subtracting normalized central moments of the subset distribution from the mean, and it shows whether the amplitude of the seizure frequency is consistent and it helps to distinguish a seizure from a transient event. The blocks (RH blocks and LH blocks) of 32  s from 8192 are merged with 50 % overlap, resulting in a signature in every 16  s. A triangular window having 1024 sample size with 50 % overlap is used {{resulting in a total}} of 15 subset transforms from each RH and LH blocks. Any frequency which has consistent spectral power at a give time in all the subsets is seizure frequency and is different from any normal event. They used template matching algorithm called “Powell’s direction set” method for classification, i.e. to measure the consistency of a frequency. A sensitivity of 91 % and false alarm rate of 0.02 false positives per hour is achieved as per this method. Thus, no threshold parameter and no classifier are used for classification. The algorithm is tested on 618 -h-long recordings.|$|R

Yet, while non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is commonly included in preclinical safety studies, pre-dose or post-dose EEG assessments are not. Industry practices as they relate to preclinical seizure liability and sleep assessments are not well characterized and the extent of preclinical EEG testing varies between organizations. In the current paper, we discuss the various aspects of preclinical EEG to characterize drug-induced seizure risk and sleep disturbances, as well as describe the use of these data in a regulatory context. An overview of EEG technology—its correct application and its limitations, as well as best practices for setting up the animal models is presented. Sleep and seizure detection are discussed in detail. A regulatory perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>EEG</b> <b>data</b> is provided and, tying together the previous topics is a discussion of the translational aspects of EEG...|$|R
40|$|Background: Our recent event-related {{potential}} (ERP) {{study showed}} that adolescents are more emotionally sensitive to negative events compared to adults, regardless of the valence strength of the events. The current work aimed to confirm this age-related difference in response to emotional stimuli of diverse intensities by examining EEG oscillatory power in time-frequency analysis. Methods: Time-frequency analyses were performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Electroencephalography (<b>EEG)</b> <b>data</b> recorded for highly negative (HN), moderately negative (MN) and Neutral pictures in 20 adolescents and 20 adults during a covert emotional task. The results showed a significant age by emotion interaction effect in the theta and beta oscillatory power during the 500 - 600 ms. Results: Adolescents showed significantly less pronounced theta spectral power (5. 5 - 7. 5 Hz) for HN stimuli, and larger beta (18 - 20 Hz) spectral power for both HN and MN stimuli, in comparison with neutral stimuli. By contrast, adults exhibited no significant emotion effects in theta and beta frequency bands. In addition, {{the analysis of the}} alpha spectral power (10. 5 - 12 Hz; 850 - 950 ms) showed a main effect of emotion, while the emotion by age interaction was not significant. Irrespective of adolescents or adults, HN and MN stimuli elicited enhanced alpha suppression compared to Neutral stimuli, while the alpha power was similar across HN and MN conditions. Conclusions: These results confirmed prior findings that adolescents are more sensitive to emotionally negative stimuli compared to adults, regardless of emotion intensity, possibly due to the developing prefrontal control system during adolescence...|$|R
