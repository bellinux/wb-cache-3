5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E

Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the Petersen Events Center, a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> bomb threats that occurred in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1971, the General Service Administration’s (GSA) United States Special Policeman (USSP) {{conducted}} law enforcement, {{safety and}} security functions at the Pentagon. The protection programs were primarily a “guard-watchman” operation, where USSP were primarily concerned with the protection of property. However, {{in response to a}} growing number <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> incidents throughout the country affecting federal facilities under GSA control, attention to the security program had to be re-examined. As a result of mass demonstrations, bombings and bomb threats within the country and region, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) was established and the comprehensive protection of Pentagon personnel rather than the previous policy of concentration on property were developed.|$|E

25|$|With the Armistice, the {{immediate}} {{need for a}} specialist close support aircraft evaporated, and 157 Squadron was quickly disbanded. Production continued for several months following the Armistice, with at least 497 completed. It was discovered postwar that 70 Salamanders had been fitted with Sopwith Snipe wings instead of the stronger wings of the Salamander, rendering the aircraft unsafe, while the armoured section was subject to spontaneous distortion, misaligning the airframe and again making the aircraft dangerous. The Salamander was used in trials of various patterns <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> camouflage in 1919, while some Salamanders were still in use at Heliopolis, Egypt in 1922. One example went to America, and was still in existence at McCook Field in 1926.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities; {{the objective of the}} squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor. The squad's focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad's activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.|$|E
25|$|Like other American {{research}} universities, Northwestern {{was transformed}} by World War II. Franklyn B.

After the war surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure, from 1949 to 1970, {{was responsible for the}} expansion of the Evanston campus with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. Tensions between the Evanston community and the university were strained throughout much of the post-war era given episodes <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> student activism, Northwestern's exemption from property tax obligations, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus under the original charter although the latter ban was lifted in 1972.|$|E

500|$|The {{pioneering}} work of Thayer and Cott is endorsed in the 2006 review <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> coloration by Martin Stevens and colleagues, which notes that they proposed a [...] "different form of camouflage" [...] {{from the traditional}} [...] "strategy of background matching" [...] proposed by authors such as Alfred Russel Wallace (Darwinism, 1889), Edward Bagnall Poulton (The Colours of Animals, 1890) and Frank Evers Beddard (Animal Coloration, 1895); Stevens observes that background matching on its own would always fail because of [...] "discontinuities between the boundary of the animal and the background".|$|E
500|$|Dazzle {{was created}} in {{response}} to an extreme need, and hosted by an organisation, the Admiralty, which had already rejected an approach supported by scientific theory: Kerr's proposal to use [...] "parti-colouring" [...] based on the known camouflage methods <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> coloration and countershading. This was dropped in favour of an admittedly non-scientific approach, led by the socially well-connected Wilkinson. Kerr's explanations of the principles were clear, logical, and based on years of study, while Wilkinson's were simple and inspirational, based on an artist's perception. The decision was likely because the Admiralty felt comfortable with Wilkinson, in sharp contrast to their awkward relationship with the stubborn and pedantic Kerr.|$|E

Chapter 14 discusses the barred markings of hawks and owls, with further fine plates of photographs by the Keartons of disruptively patterned waders and their cryptic chicks.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{model for the}} valuation <b>of</b> investments in <b>disruptive</b> technologies is developed. Based on the conceptual framework proposed by Christensen (1997) for explaining the Innovators Dilemmaphenomenon, an investment project {{is divided into two}} sequential phases representing the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>disruptive</b> technology from an emerging to a mainstream market. In each of these phases, development costs and net commercialization cash flows are modeled using various stochastic processes that interact with each other. As a result, the initial estimate on the value of the project is continuously updated to reflect the stochastic changes of these variables. An example illustrates the usefulness of the model for understanding the effects of cash flow and cost volatilities in the value <b>of</b> a <b>disruptive</b> technology investment. 1 Introduction Innovation, defined as the creation of something new or as the adoption of an idea or behavior that is new for the organization that [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Insane Clown President {{contains}} two original articles {{in addition to}} a compilation of 25 reports from Rolling Stone by Matt Taibbi along the 2016 United States presidential election campaign trail. Taibbi characterizes the phenomenon of the 2016 election campaign as, [...] "simultaneously the most thrilling and disgusting political event of our generation." [...] In the work's introduction, Taibbi quotes from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, and documents how he foresaw the increasing influence <b>of</b> <b>disruptive</b> societal factors such as the alt-right and fake news ten years before the book's publication.

Taibbi observes, [...] "The country’s leaders are corrupt and have become unresponsive {{to the needs of the}} population. People all over are beginning to notice. This being America, as ordinary people tune out their corrupt leaders, they will replace official propaganda with conspiratorial explanations even more ridiculous than the original lies."
