5|$|Under the Acts of Union in 1800, Irish peers {{were allowed}} to elect twenty-eight {{representative}} peers, each of whom could serve for life. The Chamber of the Irish House of Lords, located in Parliament House on College Green in central Dublin, housed the first election, attended by the peers or their proxies. The Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. The results of the first election were announced by the Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> and published in both The Dublin Gazette and The London Gazette. After the Union, new elections were held whenever vacancies occurred due {{to the death of}} any peer. The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain—the presiding officer of the House of Lords—certified the vacancy, while the Lord Chancellor of Ireland directed the Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> to issue ballots to Irish peers. The ballots were returned to the Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> in Ireland, who was responsible for determining the victor.|$|E
