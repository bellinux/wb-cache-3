5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
500|$|In Dhaka, East Pakistan (now in Bangladesh), Harvey made 96 on a matting pitch <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> in the First Test, {{mastering}} the medium pace of Fazal Mahmood, while his teammates struggled to score. In {{the course of}} the innings, Harvey had to overcome a fever, dysentery and physical illness, which forced him to leave six times to recompose himself. Gideon Haigh called it [...] "one of his most dazzling innings". Described by Benaud as [...] "one of the best innings at Test level", it set up an Australian win. During his stay at the crease, his partners contributed 48 runs while seven wickets fell. Harvey's innings allowed Australia to score 225 in reply to the hosts' 200. Harvey then made 30 in the second innings to help ensure an eight-wicket win.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{references}} {{also use}} the term pedrail. The issue is further confused by Bottrill referring to his design as [...] "ped-rail shoes". [...] The two concepts are similar in that they attempt to improve cross-country performance by spreading out the load on a flat surface. The difference is primarily in how the pads are connected; the dreadnaught wheel connects the pads {{to each other and}} ride along the wheel, whereas in the pedal arrangement, introduced in 1903, each pad is connected to a pivot on the wheel itself, and there are no inter-pad connections. Some pedrail systems also include internal suspensions to improve their performance <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Bottrill's design spans the definition, as its cable attachments are similar to the pedrail connections, albeit much more simple.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} much simpler than what Sandra said as she descended the Acro-Corinth, keeping to the little path, while Jacob strode <b>over</b> <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> by her side. She had been left motherless {{at the age of}} four; and the Park was vast.|$|R
5000|$|Fell running - an English and Welsh {{sport of}} running <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> {{mountain}}ous <b>ground,</b> often off-trail. Known as hill running in Scotland and Ireland. Similarities exist with mountain running ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning there}} was a low, {{brooding}} sky, and at noon snow began to fall, but they kept on until evening <b>over</b> very <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> and then held a council round the fire.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{archaeologist}} Charles Love experimented with a 10-tonne replica. His first experiment found rocking the statue to walk {{it was too}} unstable over {{more than a few}} hundred yards. He then found that placing the statue upright on two sled runners atop log rollers, 25 men were able to move the statue [...] in two minutes. In 2003, further research indicated this method could explain supposedly regularly spaced post holes (his research on this claim has not yet been published) where the statues were moved <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> He suggested the holes contained upright posts {{on either side of the}} path so that as the statue passed between them, they were used as cantilevers for poles to help push the statue up a slope without the requirement of extra people pulling on the ropes and similarly to slow it on the downward slope. The poles could also act as a brake when needed.|$|E
60|$|To flee {{was their}} first and natural impulse; but to flee in the dark, <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> and with very {{imperfect}} ideas as {{to the position of}} the cave's outlet, was dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Otto, {{you have}} not taken into {{consideration}} {{the fact that our}} raft must be so large that, when finished, the dragging of it <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> would require three or four horses instead of three human beings." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held out}} his paw again, and Twinkle took it {{with one of her}} hands while she carried the pail with the other, and so managed to get <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> very easily.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{there was a}} low, {{brooding}} sky, and at noon snow began to fall, but they kept on until evening <b>over</b> very <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> and then they held a council round the fire.|$|R
60|$|Simultaneously {{we started}} upon {{the trail of}} the great beast. Woola was quickly made to {{understand}} our desires, so that it was unnecessary to attempt to keep in sight of the animal whose swift flight <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> soon put him beyond our vision.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say," [...] {{said the}} botanist, with a {{prevalent}} index finger, and the resolute deliberation {{of a big}} siege gun being lugged into action <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> {{by a number of}} inexperienced men, [...] "you prefer a natural death to an artificial life. But what is your definition (stress) of artificial? ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not--'cause we {{was both}} mounted that time, and scurryin' <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> like wild-cats. The best o' shots would miss thar an' thus. Besides, Buck Tom took nothin' from me, an' ye wouldn't have me shoot {{a man for}} missin' me--surely. If you're so fond o' killin', why didn't you shoot him yourself?--you had a rare chance!" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he strode}} {{away into the}} darkness, Francis {{followed}} him. He was shoeless, for {{at that time the}} lower class seldom wore any protection to the feet, unless when going a journey <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Among the gondoliers shoes were unknown; and Francis himself generally took his off, for coolness and comfort, when out for the evening in his boat.|$|E
50|$|The western Kentmere slopes fall <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> of Hallow Bank Quarter to Ullstone Gill, a {{tributary}} of the River Kent. Beyond here Smallthwaite Knott, an outlier of Harter Fell, separates Kentmere Pike from the main valley. There is extensive evidence of former quarrying on this flank.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he led her}} up {{the street}} and through that end of camp out upon the rough, open slope. They began to climb. The stars were bright, but even so Joan {{stumbled}} often over the stones. She wondered how Jim could get along so well {{in the dark and}} she clung to his arm. They did not speak often, and then only in whispers. Jim halted occasionally to listen or to look up at the bold, black bluff for his bearings. Presently he led her among broken fragments of cliff, and half carried her <b>over</b> <b>rougher</b> <b>ground,</b> into a kind of shadowy pocket or niche.|$|R
5000|$|... “Loch Coruisk, {{said to be}} {{the wildest}} scene in the Highlands, I failed in seeing. After a {{fatiguing}} expedition <b>over</b> the <b>roughest</b> <b>ground</b> on a wet day we arrived at the banks of the loch, and made acquaintance with the extremest tiptoes of the hills, all else being thick wool-white fog.” ...|$|R
60|$|It was one {{of these}} long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> for {{a quarter of a mile}} or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.|$|E
6000|$|While {{the battle}} was at its height Terence was {{despatched}} by the brigadier to carry an order {{to one of the}} regiments that had pushed too far forward in its ardour. Scrambling <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> and occasionally leaping a wall, he reached the colonel. [...] "The general requests you to fall back a little, sir; you are farther forward than the regiment on your flank. The enemy are pushing a force down the hill in your direction, and as there is no support that can be sent to you at present, he wishes your extreme right {{to be in touch with}} the left of the regiment holding Elvina." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt they}} would move more regularly," [...] Terence agreed, [...] "but in {{mountain}} warfare that makes little difference; {{as soon as}} they have learned to shoot straight, and to have confidence in themselves, they will do just as well holding a defile or the head of a bridge {{as if they had been}} drilled for months. We must get hold of some horns of some sort, and they must learn a few simple calls, such as the advance, retire, form square, and things of that sort. With such large companies the voice would never be heard in the din of a battle. I hope that we shall get at least a week to practise skirmishing <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> and to fall back in good order, taking advantage of every rock and shelter, before we get under fire. Do you know anything about blowing up bridges?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On December 9, 1944, Martin was {{returning}} to base from an escort mission when his P-51 Mustang suffered engine trouble. He was forced to land at a gunnery range Cuetelo, Italy. As the plane fell <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> the propeller was damaged. Martin was able {{to walk away from}} the crash landing.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} the robbers were {{far away from the}} scene of their consultation; and the {{darkness}} of the night, as predicted, became so intense that it was quite impossible to advance further <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> without the risk of broken limbs, if not worse. A halt was therefore called for rest, food, and consultation.|$|R
50|$|A trywheel is an {{arrangement}} of three wheels mounted on a y-shaped frame {{for the purpose of}} passing <b>over</b> stairs or <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> These may be driven by external force or integral motors.|$|R
60|$|From {{that time}} forward his {{recovery}} was rapid, {{and two days}} later we began our journey back to Marais's camp, the convalescent Pereira being carried in a litter by the four natives. It was a task at which they grumbled a good deal, for the load was heavy <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> and whenever they stumbled or shook him he cursed at them. So much did he curse, indeed, that at length one of the Zulus, {{a man with a}} rough temper, said that {{if it were not for}} the Inkoos, meaning myself, he would put his assegai through him, and let the vultures carry him. After this Pereira grew much more polite. When the bearers became exhausted we set him on the pack-ox, which two of us led, while the other two supported him on either side. It was in this fashion that at last we arrived at the camp one evening.|$|E
6000|$|... 18th November.--About 2 A.M. the camels (eleven in number) were lightly loaded, {{portions}} of the luggage being sent back to Kurayat till more carriage could be procured. The caravan crossed the plain southwards, and after about two miles' march entered a deep stony watercourse winding through the barren hills. After five miles' progress <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> Lieutenant Speke unloaded under a tree early in the afternoon near some pools of sweet rain water collected in natural basins of limestone dotting the watercourse. The place is called Iskodubuk; {{the name of the}} watercourse is Duktura. The Sultan and the Abban were both left behind to escort the baggage from Las Kuray to Kurayat. They promised to rejoin Lieutenant Speke before nightfall; the former appeared after five, the latter after ten, days. The Sultan sent his son Abdallah, a youth of about fifteen years old, who proved so troublesome that Lieutenant Speke was forced repeatedly to dismiss him: still the lad would not leave the caravan till it reached the Dulbahanta frontier. And the Abban delayed a Negro servant, Lieutenant Speke's gun-bearer, trying by many offers and promises to seduce him from service.|$|E
60|$|There {{was plenty}} {{to keep her}} occupied, mind and body. The train of persons saved from the wreck were {{arriving}} {{in all sorts of}} vehicles, and as clothes had to be found for them as well as food and shelter there was no end to the exertions necessary. She felt as though the world were not wide enough for the welcome she wished to extend. Its exercise was a sort of reward of her exertions; a thank-offering for the response to her prayer. She moved amongst her guests, forgetful of herself; of her strange attire; of the state of dishevelment and grime in which she was, the result of the storm, her long ride <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> with its share of marshes and pools, and the smoke from the bonfire and the blazing house. The strangers wondered at first, till they came to understand that she was the Lady Bountiful who had stretched her helpful hands to them. Those who could, made themselves useful with the new batches of arrivals. The whole Castle was lit from cellar to tower. The kitchens were making lordly provision, the servants were carrying piles of clothes of all sorts, and helping to fit those who came still wet from their passage through or over the heavy sea.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the crowd}} from the flying-field were running toward him, yelling. He grinned at the foolish sight they made with their {{legs and arms}} strewn about {{in the air as}} they galloped <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Lieutenant Haviland came up, panting: [...] "All right, o' man? Good!" [...] He seized Carl's hand and wrung it. Carl knew that he had a new friend.|$|R
60|$|Spurring {{after him}} Billy and Bridge ran their horses <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> {{at the base}} of the little hill, and then {{parallel}} to the arroyo for a matter of a hundred yards, where they espied two Indians, carbines in hand, standing in evident consternation because of the unexpected fusillade of shots which they had just heard and which they were unable to account for.|$|R
60|$|Outside of the doctor, who was {{not used}} to walking <b>over</b> such <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> no one felt any ill effects of the day's journey, {{although}} all were glad to turn in at the earliest possible moment. The doctor had worn a slight blister on his heel, and, in order to prevent this giving him serious concern later, he put some salve on it and bound it up before retiring.|$|R
60|$|Upon one {{of these}} excursions, while Reuben was {{otherwise}} employed, David alone acted as Lady Staunton's guide, and promised to show her a cascade in the hills, grander and higher than any they had yet visited. It was a walk of five long miles, and <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> varied, however, and cheered, by mountain views, and peeps now of the firth and its islands, now of distant lakes, now of rocks and precipices. The scene itself, too, when they reached it, amply rewarded the labour of the walk. A single shoot carried a considerable stream over {{the face of a}} black rock, which contrasted strongly in colour with the white foam of the cascade, and, at the depth of about twenty feet, another rock intercepted the view of the bottom of the fall. The water, wheeling out far beneath, swept round the crag, which thus bounded their view, and tumbled down the rocky glen in a torrent of foam. Those who love nature always desire to penetrate into its utmost recesses, and Lady Staunton asked David whether there was not some mode of gaining a view of the abyss {{at the foot of the}} fall. He said that he knew a station on a shelf on the farther side of the intercepting rock, from which the whole waterfall was visible, but that the road to it was steep and slippery and dangerous. Bent, however, on gratifying her curiosity, she desired him to lead the way; and accordingly he did so over crag and stone, anxiously pointing out to her the resting-places where she ought to step, for their mode of advancing soon ceased to be walking, and became scrambling.|$|E
6000|$|Then I went on, {{not exactly}} {{at ease in}} mind, but stirred and thrilled to the keen charged atmosphere. I had to go around under {{the base of a}} rocky ledge, <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Presently I dropped into a bear trail, well trodden. I {{followed}} it to a corner of cliff where it went down. Then I kept on over loose rock and bare earth washed deep in ruts. I had to leap these. Perhaps in ten minutes I had traveled {{a quarter of a mile}} or less. Then spang! R.C.'s rifle-shot halted me. So clear and sharp, so close, so startling! I was thrilled, delighted--he had gotten a shot. I wanted to yell my pleasure. My blood warmed and my nerves tingled. Swiftly my thoughts ran--bad luck was nothing--a man had only to stick at a thing--what a fine, sharp, wonderful day for adventure! How the hounds bayed! Had R.C. sighted a bear somewhere below? Suddenly the still air split--spang! R.C.'s second shot gave me a shock. My breast contracted. I started back. [...] "Suppose it was a grizzly--on that bad side!" [...] I muttered. Spang!... I began to run. A great sweeping wave of emotion charged over me, swelling all my veins to the bursting point. Spang! My heart came to my throat. Leaping the ruts, bounding like a sheep from rock to rock, I covered my back tracks. All inside me seemed to flutter, yet I felt cold and hard--a sickening sense of reproach that I had left my brother in a bad position. Spang! His fifth and last shot followed swiftly after the fourth--too swift to be accurate. So hurriedly a man would act in close quarters. R.C. now had an empty rifle!... Like a flash I crossed that slope leading to the rocks, and tore around the cliff at such speed that it was a wonder I did not pitch down and break my neck. How long--how terribly long I seemed in reaching the corner of cliff! Then I plunged to a halt with eyes darting everywhere.|$|E
6000|$|Early on March 14th we {{ascended the}} Wady el-Káimah, which showed a {{singular}} spectacle, and read us another lecture upon {{the diversity of}} formation which distinguishes this region. An abrupt turn then led <b>over</b> <b>rough</b> <b>ground,</b> the lower folds of the Umm Furút, where a great granite gorge, the Nakb Abú Shár, ran up to a depression in the dorsum, an apparently practicable Col. Suddenly the rocks assumed the quaintest hues and forms. The quartz, slaty-blue and black, was here spotted and streaked with a dull, dead white, as though stained by the droppings of myriad birds: there it lay veined and marbled with the most vivid of rainbow colours-- reds and purples, greens and yellows, set off by the pale chalky white. Evident signs of work were remarked in a made road running up to the Jebel el-Marú (proper), whose strike is 38° (mag.), and whose dip is westward. It is an arête, a cock's-comb of snowy quartz some sixty feet high by forty-five broad at the base; crowning a granitic fold that descends abruptly, with a deep fall on either side, from the [...] "Mother of Plenty." [...] This strangely isolated wall, left standing by the denudation that swept away the containing stone, had been broken by perpendicular rifts into four distinct sections; the colour became whiter as it neared the coping, and each rock was crowned with a capping that sparkled like silver in the sudden glance of the [...] "cloud-compelling" [...] sun. The sight delighted us; and M. Lacaze here made {{one of his most}} effective croquis, showing the explorers reduced to the size of ants. As yet we had seen nothing of the kind; nor shall we see a similar vein till we reach Abú'l-Marwah, near our farthest southern point. I expected a corresponding formation upon the opposite eastern versant: we found only a huge crest, a spine of black plutonic rock, intensely ugly and repulsive. As we rode back down the [...] "Valley of the Perpendiculars," [...] the aspect of the Jebel el-Marú was épâtant--to use another favourite camp-word. Standing sharply out from its vague and gloomy background made gloomier by the morning mists, the Col, whose steep rain-cut slopes and sole were scattered with dark trees and darker rocks, this glittering wall became the shell of an enchanted castle in Gustave Doré.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{inversion}} of Synthetic Aperture Radar data is dealt with and, in particular, {{the problem of}} reconstructing forest height is addressed. The forest is modelled as a random volume of particles <b>over</b> a <b>rough</b> <b>ground.</b> Under this model, the forest height {{turns out to be}} related to the bandwidth of the scattered field. The inversion is cast as an optimization one. Preliminary results using DLR-ESAR experimental SAR data are shown...|$|R
25|$|The ridge {{north from}} Brim Fell narrows to the {{depression}} at Levers Hawse (2,250ft) before climbing again <b>over</b> the <b>rougher</b> <b>ground</b> of Great How Crags {{to the summit}} of Swirl How. To the south, trending south east across a broad plateau is The Old Man of Coniston, the reascent being negligible. Halfway between Brim Fell and 'The Old Man' a further ridge branches off due west, dropping steeply to Goat's Hawse (2,130ft), before swinging south around Goat's Water to Dow Crag.|$|R
60|$|A {{continuous}} {{stream of}} doolies and stretchers commenced to {{flow from the}} fighting line. Soon all available conveyances were exhausted, and {{the bodies of the}} wounded had to be carried <b>over</b> the <b>rough</b> <b>ground</b> in the arms of their comrades--a very painful process, which extorted many a groan from the suffering men. At length the withdrawal was completed, and the brigade returned to camp. The presence of the cavalry, who covered the rear, deterred the enemy from leaving the hills.|$|R
