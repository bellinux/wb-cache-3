5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} moved over the East China Sea on September1, Agnes began to {{interact}} with a mid-latitude trough situated south of South Korea and began a prolonged extratropical transition. Increasing wind shear exposed {{the center of the}} typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September1, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity. The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. The diminishing cyclone moved over the Korea Strait on September3 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Japan, the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on September4 with an estimated pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg). After moving <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Okhotsk, Agnes impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia on September5. The system then moved over the open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the International Dateline on September6.|$|E

5|$|Incidents of waterspouts causing {{severe damage}} and {{casualties}} are rare. However, {{there have been}} several notable examples. The Malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout. It struck the Grand Harbour of Valletta, sinking four galleys, numerous boats, and claiming hundreds of lives. The 1851 Sicily Tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Little Boy pre-assemblies were {{designated}} L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test {{was conducted with}} L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> near Tinian {{in order to test}} the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as Big Stink, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as Jabit. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 Next Objective, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb.|$|E
5|$|With the {{effective}} defeat of Belgium JG 27 was moved into forward airfields {{to support the}} invasion of France. During the Battle of Dunkirk, after encountering the Supermarine Spitfire for the first time, Galland was impressed with these aircraft and their pilots. On 29 May, Galland claimed he had shot down a Bristol Blenheim <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> On 3 June during Operation Paula, he claimed another French aircraft, a Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 for his 12th victory.|$|E
5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed for Japan during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April.|$|E

5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} {{just before the}} Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects.

By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E
5|$|By late March the Embassy {{began to}} reduce the number of US {{citizens}} in Vietnam by encouraging dependents and non-essential personnel to leave the country by commercial flights and on Military Airlift Command (MAC) C-141 and C-5 aircraft, which were still bringing in emergency military supplies. In late March, two or three of these MAC aircraft were arriving each day and were used for the evacuation of civilians and Vietnamese orphans. On 4 April a C-5A aircraft carrying 250 Vietnamese orphans and their escorts suffered explosive decompression <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> near Vung Tau and made a crash-landing while attempting to return to Tan Son Nhut; 153 people on board died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55Â° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E

On the 15th, while New Jersey was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC-121 Constellation electronic surveillance plane <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Japan, killing its entire crew.

British ground defences, {{which had}} taken their toll on the German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by a decision to shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes.

5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying CÃº Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the MorrÃ­gan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow â if it flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|On July26, the typhoon turned {{towards the}} {{northwest}} and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck {{the southern coast}} of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205km (125mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12hours. The remnants of Judy were last noted on July29 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Japan.|$|E
