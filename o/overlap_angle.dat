Spherical PVC particles (which fall under type D in Geldarts classification) with two different sizes (5. 75 and 9. 84 mm) {{were used as}} bed material to study different bed configurations, {{taking into account the}} variation of fraction of open area (12. 9 and 17. 2 %), blade <b>overlapping</b> <b>angles</b> (9 and 12) and bed weight (500 to 2000 g) for superficial velocities is from 1 to 7 m sec - 1. The performance of the swirling fluidized bed was assessed in terms of pressure drop values, minimum fluidization velocity and fluidization quality by physical observation on regimes of operation. The most significant finding is that the pressure drop of the bed increased with superficial velocity after minimum fluidization, in contrast with a conventional fluidized bed. It was also found that the blade geometry has less effect on bed performance, compared to fraction of open area and particle size. New regimes of operation were discovered, and designated as wave regime and two-layer bed regime. The best configuration obtained in the current work, which provides stable swirling at lower pressure drops, is the one with 60 distributor blades and 12 <b>overlapping</b> <b>angle,</b> operating with 9. 84 mm particles...|$|R

40|$|In a {{transformer}} for static converter, interrupted currents flow through its DC windings. The DC components of these current bias magnetomotive forces in respective magnetic cores of the transformer. Thus the iron cores are asymmetrically magnetized. To avoid various abnormal phenomena {{associated with this}} asymmetrical magnetization, we often use the so-called Greatz connection. However, even in this case {{a transformer}} is sometimes asymmetrically magnetized due to unbalance of control angles and variations of <b>overlapping</b> <b>angles</b> due to ripples of DC cur. rent.

As the results of comperation, it has been pointed out that：(1) the respollse speed of asymmetrical magnetization method is higher than that of lagging angle control method；(2) the output voltage of asymmetrical magnetization method can easily be adjusted over the range of 10 ％, but that of lagging angle control method is adjustable from zero to its rated values, (3) the structure of asymmetrical magnetization control device is simpler than that of lagging angle control device...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Basically a {{welded joint}} is a {{permanent}} joint which is obtained by fusion of {{the edges of the}} two plates to be joined together with or without application of pressure and filler material. Welding is extensively used in fabrication as an alternative method for casting or forging and as a replacement for a bolted and riveted joint. Since it is related to human being, it is necessary to design and analysis the joint with prior attention to safely of its user. A better approach to the prediction of welding deformation is using the combined technologies of experiments with numerical calculation. With modern computing facilities, the Finite Element (FE) technique has become an effective method for prediction and assessment of welding residual stress and distortions various factors, the quantitative prediction and the control of welding deformation especially for a large and complex welded structure is extremely difficult. Typical welds are done on flat surfaces and their strengths are well catalogued for reference.

40|$|Abstract? The {{effect of}} soft and softer handoffs on code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system {{capacity}} is evaluated for unsectorized and sectorized hexagonal cells {{according to an}} average bit energy-to-interference power spectral density, which corresponds to a bit-error rate (BER) of 10 - 3. The effect of imperfect sectorization on sectorization efficiency is also considered. On the reverse link, there is no capacity loss as no extra channels are needed to perform soft handoff, while the macrodiversity provided by soft handoff can improve the reverse-link quality and extend the cell coverage. On the forward link, when soft handoff is employed in unsectorized cells, the capacity loss due to two traffic channels assigned to a user in the handoff zone is 0. 2 % or 1. 1 % for a voice activity factor of 3 / 8 or 1 / 2, respectively. As the forward-link capacity is {{higher than that of}} the reverse link, this small capacity loss does not affect the system capacity. For sectorized cells having three sectors per cell, there are overlapping coverage areas between sectors, where mobiles in these areas are subjected to an increase in cochannel iterference. For an <b>overlapping</b> <b>angle</b> of 5 °, the sectorization efficiency is 0. 96 and 0. 7 for the reverse-link and forward-link systems, respectively. When soft and softer handoffs are employed, the forward-link sectorization efficiency is improved to 0. 97. We find the application of soft and softer handoff improves not only the forward-link capacity, but also the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for mobiles near the cell and sector boundaries.

40|$|After the {{development}} of power electronics converters, the number of transformers subjected to non-sinusoidal stresses (including DC) has increased in applications such as HVDC links and traction (electric train power cars). The effects of non-sinusoidal voltages on transformer insulation have been investigated by many researchers, but still now, there are some issues that must be understood. Some of those issues are tackled in this Thesis, studying PD phenomena behavior in Kraft paper, pressboard and mineral oil at different voltage conditions like AC, DC, AC+DC, notched AC and square waveforms. From {{the point of view}} of converter transformers, it was found that the combined effect of AC and DC voltages produces higher stresses in the pressboard that those that are present under pure DC voltages. The electrical conductivity of the dielectric systems in DC and AC+DC conditions has demonstrated to be a critical parameter, so, its measurement and analysis was also taken into account during all the experiments. Regarding notched voltages, the RMS reduction caused by notches (depending on firing and <b>overlap</b> <b>angles)</b> seems to increase the PDIV. However, the experimental results show that once PD activity has incepted, the notches increase PD repetition rate and magnitude, producing a higher degradation rate of paper. On the other hand, the reduction of mineral oil stocks, their relatively low flash point as well as environmental issues, are factors that are pushing towards the use of esters as transformer insulating fluids. This PhD Thesis also covers the study of two different esters with the scope to validate their use in traction transformers. Mineral oil was used as benchmark. The complete set of dielectric tests performed in the three fluids, show that esters behave better than mineral oil in practically all the investigated conditions, so, their application in traction transformers is possible and encouraged. ...|$|R
