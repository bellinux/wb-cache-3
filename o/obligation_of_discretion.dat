40|$|This article investigates {{a general}} {{perception}} amongst academics that outcomes-based {{education and training}} (OBET), together with the prescriptions around the national qualifications framework, (NQF) have an inhibiting impact on academic freedom in higher education in South Africa. It proposes an alternative view, namely that academic freedom is, in fact, greatly enhanced by the architectural design of OBET. This argument is built around the distinction between educational inputs and outputs, which represent the domains of academics and quality assurance agencies respectively. It acknowledges that freedom should be exercised {{within the context of}} national imperatives, as long as these imperatives themselves are not educationally restrictive. These views crystallise in the recognition that the right of academics to enjoy academic freedom presupposes an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> — a phrase coined to describe the peculiar responsibilities imposed on academics by that particular educa-tional paradigm...|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms <b>of</b> fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> were recognized: fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms <b>of</b> fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> have been said to represent two elements defining the concept <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion <b>of</b> one's personal <b>discretion.</b>|$|R

50|$|According to Lipsky, the {{exercise}} <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> among street level bureaucrats {{is critical in}} how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work. Lipsky said the use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as {{a major reason for}} the opposition <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies. Marissa Kelly also examines the use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.|$|R

40|$|The {{construct}} employee discretion {{has been}} researched under many labels (e. g., flexibility, autonomy). As a result, employee discretion has been operationalized differently across multiple streams of research leading to construct deficiency, contamination, and confounding. The current study contributes to the research literature in three distinct ways. First, the literature on employee discretion is reviewed, in order to clearly differentiate the three primary conceptualizations of employee discretion: choice over when, where, and how one works. Second, the influence of these three forms <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> on both work-related outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover intentions) and nonwork-related outcomes (life satisfaction, work-to-nonwork conflict, negative physical health symptoms and psychological health symptoms) was examined in order to reveal the relative impact of each form <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> using distinct measures. Third, three potential moderators (role ambiguity, locus of control, and perceived organizational support) of the employee discretion-outcome relationship were examined {{in order to determine}} if there are important boundary conditions to the benefit of the various forms <b>of</b> employee <b>discretion.</b> Faculty members are frequently given a high degree <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> over when, where, and how they conduct many aspects of their work, particularly their research-related tasks. Despite the many advantages <b>of</b> employee <b>discretion,</b> many faculty members report feeling pressured, stressed, and experience conflict between work and non-work roles, suggesting the possibility that too much discretion can be problematic. Survey data were collected from a sample of 1223 faculty members. Results revealed main effects for discretion over how work is conducted on work-related outcomes while discretion over when and where had main effects on almost all work and nonwork-related outcomes examined. Contrary to expectations, discretion appeared to have linear rather than nonlinear effects on all the outcomes examined and combinations of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> did not yield synergistic effects. Role ambiguity moderated the relationship between the where dimension <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> and several outcomes, such that individuals with high levels of role ambiguity and high levels <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> over where they work had worse outcomes than individuals with low role ambiguity and low levels <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> over where they work. These results suggest that employees unclear about their responsibilities benefit less from discretion over where they work. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a fairly}} {{extensive}} literature in representative bureaucracy, {{we still have}} not clearly identified many of the organizational processes and influences that move passive representatives from mere perceptions <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> to active representation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify some of the effects and sources <b>of</b> administrative <b>discretion,</b> and some <b>of</b> the factors which motivate administrators to exercise their discretion and enact representative behaviors. The following research questions form the basis of this paper: What organizational characteristics influence perceptions <b>of</b> <b>discretion?</b> What is the relationship between organizational characteristics, role expectations and individual perceptions <b>of</b> <b>discretion?</b> Are these relationships significant in the process of translating passive into active representation? The data for this study were gathered from a survey of 2, 329 State of Tennessee employees. The findings suggest that the effects of organization structure and processes on perceptions <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> are mediated by organizational leadership. These mediating influences appear to be particularly important under conditions of uncertainty. The generalizability of this study is limited to state employment in Tennessee. Future studies should be extended to employees in other states and focus on smaller sets of the significant relationships identified in this study...|$|R

40|$|Most {{academic}} papers condemn {{discretion in}} the enforcement and prosecution of crime. This essay argues that discretion {{should be understood}} to come in three varieties: good discretion, which is beneficial; bad discretion, which is typified by acts motivated by race, sex, or class considerations; and mundane discretion, which is value-neutral. The decision to pursue a drunken driver rather than a speeder, for example, is a good use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> while the decision to pursue one speeder rather than another based on race is bad discretion. Most motives that prompt acts <b>of</b> <b>discretion,</b> however, are value-neutral or what I call “mundane” in the essay. I defend the proposition that mundane acts <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> should not be condemned because they are simply the residue {{of what it means}} to be human. Even the decision of a police officer not to arrest a speeder because the officer is too lazy or too near the end of her shift is, I argue, value neutral because it is not based on any characteristic of the suspect. Once we realize that most types <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> are either good or mundane, it is easier to think about the problem of remedy for bad types <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> On that score, the essay is not optimistic that effective remedies can be designed to counter discretion based on race, sex, or class but some remedies are considered...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is often}} {{hard to control}} officers' use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> because <b>of</b> {{the way it is}} applied to situations. [...] "Policing the police" [...] is a very {{important}} part in maintaining a balance <b>of</b> police <b>discretion</b> and controlling it so the power <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> is not abused. Unfortunately, the police have an ability to perform an abuse <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> without being noticed or regulated by the judicial or legislative community in what {{is referred to as the}} [...] "legal shadow". In this place questionable police tactics are being performed and, in a sense, covered up with police privilege backed by government support. Although there has been some effort by the federal government to regulate police discretion, unless there is a conflict including the Constitution, it is difficult for them to involve themselves. Most of the time police misconduct doesn't draw enough attention to include federal intervention.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain.
