2500|$|In {{at least}} one case, Chang Wang, the {{president}} of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an [...] "excess of genetic material in her blood" [...] and advised her to see her doctor in order [...] "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used <b>our</b> <b>technology</b> to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [...] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." [...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.|$|E
