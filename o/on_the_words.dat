5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program was not ready for use at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Mya's visual representation, however, {{appeared}} solely during {{advertising and}} on her website. Only her voice was to be heard when using the actual program. Demonstrations of Mya's abilities and images of the character could be viewed at the now defunct website, mya.com. Raimondi said he believed the name Mya was a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> 'My assistant', as did Sidney Matrix in the book Cyberpop: Digital Lifestyles and Commodity Culture.|$|E
5|$|A naming {{exception}} was Huge Viking, {{which was used}} for a Boeing 747. Huge was the quickest being in Norse mythology, but the name also played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> English meaning. SAS reuses the names from retired aircraft, except for those of crashed aircraft. Because of oversights, the name Agnar and Rane have however been reused. A similar naming convention, albeit using the full name of kings, was used by Braathens SAFE of Norway and Loftleiðir of Iceland. As Carlzon was opposed to the Viking references, he also proposed that the names be abolished. The executive management reverted its decision following massive protests from within the airline. Female aircraft names were introduced by Scanair in 1980, who gave them to all their Douglas DC-8s. SAS followed suit in 1989, when the entire series of Boeing 767 were named for prominent female Vikings. Scandinavian letters were introduced from the 1990s. SAS Commuter's Norwegian Fokker 50 aircraft were given names for places in Norway, such as Lakselv.|$|E

25|$|As both hurd and hird are homophones of the English word herd, {{the full}} name GNU Hurd is also a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> herd of gnus, {{reflecting}} how the kernel works.

25|$|Stallman places great {{importance}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and labels people use {{to talk about}} the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say, free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copyright).

He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.|$|E
25|$|The meter {{indicates}} {{the number of}} syllables for the lines in each stanza of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate hymn tune for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of {{a relatively small number}} of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.|$|E

25|$|Soon Kvachkov and {{two other}} former Spetznaz troopers, Alexander Naydenov and Robert Yashin were {{detained}} under suspicion of involvement into the assassination. The Meshchansky District Court of Moscow approved ten-days-arrest for Kvachkov. Investigators {{did not have any}} direct evidence or indicating his guilt, but indirect evidence allowed the court to issue the warrant. Igor Yartykh, a lawyer who won a case involving former paratroopers accused of the murder of Dmitry Kholodov, took Kvachkov's defense. According to the version of the investigators, Vladimir Kvachkov, Naydenov and Yashin as well as Vladimir Kvachkov's son, Alexander Kvachkov and Ivan Mironov, son of former Minister for Media and Information, Boris Mironov conspired to assassinate Chubais. The version was mostly based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of a single witness, Igor Karvatko.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a Christian {{organization}} {{asked to}} ban caricatures {{published by the}} satirical magazine La Grosse Bertha.

The courts of first instance and appeal decided that they didn't constituted an incitement to hatred towards the Catholics. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the first court of appeal had made a procedural error, and referred the matter back to another court which confirmed the absence of conviction decided by the lower courts and considered that mockery of the Catholic religion, the faiths, the symbols and the rites of the religious practice had not caused any state of mind for incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence and was no justification to restrict the liberty of the press.|$|E
