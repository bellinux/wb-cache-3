5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out <b>of</b> <b>trucks)</b> no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> under the train, but it also dispensed {{with the need for}} couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{daily average}} of 455 cars {{traveled}} along SR-161, representing {{only a slight}} growth from previous years; in 2006, the average was 450 and in 2005, 415). Thirty five percent of this traffic was composed <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> The average traffic measurement is collected at a point on SR-161 between Cove Fort and the interchange with I-15.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{heterogeneity}} in truck drivers’ {{route choice}} preferences. A latent class model {{is estimated to}} identify heterogeneous segments of drivers. A stated choice experiment designed for identifying route choice behavior <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> drivers provides the data for model estimation. The effects of road pricing and environmental bonus are examined considering context dependency. Results reveal that size <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> is a significant segmentation variable of preferences for route attributes. Drivers <b>of</b> light <b>trucks</b> care more about congestion than drivers <b>of</b> heavy <b>trucks,</b> and are highly sensitive to road pricing and slightly sensitive to a road bonus.

5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on}} the skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
40|$|Truck {{platooning}} {{refers to}} the automated operation <b>of</b> multiple <b>trucks.</b> High expectations rest on truck platooning as to alleviate negative impacts caused by road freight transport like congestion, accidents and pollution. Furthermore, driver shortages may be partially solved by the concept <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning. This study identified enablers and barriers <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning and assessed their effect on the potential implementation of the concept. The implementation and possible adoption <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning as a transport mode is a complex and uncertain process. The magnitude {{of the consequences of}} platooning are in general unknown and many different stakeholders should be involved in the implementation process. Based on this research it can be concluded that several barriers still have to be mitigated and that cooperation between different competing companies and industries is essential for the successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> platooning.

5|$|With Caen {{north of}} the River Orne in Allied hands, mine-clearance {{operations}} were launched, bulldozers were set to work to clear the streets and a convoy <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> carrying supplies for the civilian population was brought in.

5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} that the number <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed {{to indicate that the}} enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E

Robinson went to France to compete in the Paul Ricard Grand Prix Truck Race the following year, and took second in the 1986 Grand Prix <b>of</b> <b>Trucks</b> held in Mexico City. Robinson was victorious in the GATR Big Rig race at Flemington Speedway in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{was first}} {{conceived}} in the 1980s {{as a way}} to remove traffic to PortMiami that was congesting downtown Miami streets. Prior to the tunnel's opening, the only route for PortMiami traffic was through the streets of downtown Miami; that traffic, especially trucks, was considered detrimental to the economic growth of downtown and a planned project to expand the port's capacity would increase the volume <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> through downtown. Those issues would be remedied by the construction of the tunnel, allowing traffic to move between PortMiami and the MacArthur Causeway (which connects to Interstate 95 via I-395) without traveling through downtown. In the first month after opening, the tunnel averaged 7,000 vehicles per day; nearly 16,000 vehicles travel to the port each weekday.|$|E

Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the second}} day, the {{defenders}} on the bridge saw a small convoy <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> approaching at some speed from the south, which at first they misidentified as the British XXX Corps. That they were enemy trucks did not become apparent until {{they were on the}} bridge whereupon the defenders opened fire and destroyed the convoy. Soon afterwards, German infantry and armour approached the bridge from the east. One tank reached the space under the bridge before it was destroyed by one of the 6pounder anti-tank guns. At 09:00, thirty armoured cars, half-tracks and trucks from the 9th SS Panzer Division attempted to rush the bridge from the south. The first five armoured cars, using the wrecks of the dawn convoy as cover and with the element of surprise, managed to cross unscathed. The rest of the force was engaged and twelve of their vehicles destroyed with the survivors returning to the southern bank. All day long, the force at the bridge came under fire from mortars and anti-aircraft guns positioned south of the river and were subject to probing infantry and armour attacks.|$|E
5|$|Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 6,655vehicles traveled I-84 at the interchange with SR-86 in Henefer, and as many as 18,945vehicles used the highway at the SR-26 interchange in Riverdale. Between 27 and 57percent of the traffic recorded consisted <b>of</b> <b>trucks.</b> These counts are of the portion of the freeway in Utah and are not reflective of the entire Interstate, or of its concurrency with I-15. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the entire route is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|In El Dorado, Sinaloa, {{near where}} the storm made landfall, the {{hurricane}} washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and traffic signs, leaving many without power. In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane moved ashore, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages. The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of an Independence Day Parade. Between Mazatlán and the state capital, Culiacán, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> stranded. In Culiacán, one person died when he drove his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm. Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads left many communities {{cut off from the}} rest of the country. Lane caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600million (2006MXN, $55million 2006USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Secretariat of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa. Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2billion (2006MXN), $109.3million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{continued}} {{working in}} production jobs at television stations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas until 1969, {{when he moved}} to Texarkana, bought a 16 mm camera and started an advertising agency. He started a contract with Ledwell & Son Enterprises, a Texarkana-based firm that built 18-wheel trailers and farm equipment. Pierce developed commercials for the company that played throughout the Southwestern United States, using mostly footage he shot <b>of</b> <b>trucks</b> on the highway and farming equipment being used. He said the reputation he developed with those commercials later helped him launch his film career. Also during this time, Pierce played a character named Mayor Chuckles on The Laffalot Club, a local Arkansas children's television show. Pierce launched his independent film career in the early 1970s, when he sought funding from L.W. Ledwell, the owner of Ledwell & Son Enterprises. Ledwell was skeptical of the idea, but ultimately agreed to provide about $100,000 of the $160,000 budget for Pierce's first film. Prior to his directorial debut, Pierce worked as a set decorator for television shows like the Western series Hondo and for films like Waco (1966) and Coffy (1973).|$|E
