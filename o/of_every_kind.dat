25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>kind</b> of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian {{told me that he had}} seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.)

25|$|Glass making {{reached its}} peak at the {{beginning}} of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>kind.</b> The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology. From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised, and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement. The use of coloured glass as a decorative addition to pale and colourless glasses also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels. After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to Constantinople rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the Roman military in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there. By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.|$|E

40|$|The extreme {{weakness}} of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal makes it vulnerable to almost <b>every</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> interfering signals.

However its high complexity has limited the diffusion of such techniques for GNSS applications. Since the first block of a GNSS receiver, the acquisition stage, implicitly performs a sort of time-frequency analysis it is sufficient to introduce a slight modification of the basic acquisition scheme to enable a fast and efficient time-frequency analysis for interference detection. This paper is devoted to the description of this scheme and presents some simulation result...|$|R

Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under proprietary governance. Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest. Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.|$|E
