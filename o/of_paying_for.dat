5|$|The {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain, but with {{diagonal}} cell blocks replaced with a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. The first priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> private lodging.|$|E
5|$|Waite {{threatened}} to declare martial law, but the mine owners refused to disband their deputy force. Gen. Brooks then {{threatened to}} keep his troops in the region for another 30 days. Faced with the prospect <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> a paramilitary force which could only sit on its hands, the owners agreed to disband it. The deputies, which Gen. Brooks had dispatched via rail to Colorado Springs, began dispersing on June 11. The Waite agreement became operative the same day, and the miners returned to work.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} means <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> {{the statue}} was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form}} of 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

40|$|Current {{reforms in}} the public sector are {{characterized}} by the introduction of businesslike incentive structures, in particular the introduction of "pay for performance” schemes in public institutions. However, the public sector has some specific characteristics, which might restrict the naive adoption <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance. Our article analyzes whether the impact <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance is bound to conditions, and if this is the case, under which conditions <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance has a positive or a negative effect on performance. We explore this contingency in a meta-analytic review of previous experimental studies on the effects <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on performance. We further show why <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance sometimes negatively affects personal efforts. With an experimental vignette study we demonstrate (a) that motivation {{is likely to be a}} key influence on the effect <b>of</b> performance-related <b>pay</b> on performance, and (b) that <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance is generally more costly as it appears because it almost always produces hidden costs of rewards.

5|$|Works rapidly progressed {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Wray in 1851 with the Royal Engineers, known as the sappers. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. Soft stone was used to fill in swamps around Fremantle, and when the better quality stone ran out, quarries were opened at nearby sites such as Arthur Head. The first part to be constructed was a ramp connecting the town to the prison site. The graded and limestone-capped slope would later become Fairbairn Street. Once this was completed, the priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders to relieve the expense <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> private lodging. Cottages were built along Henderson Street in 1851, and Henderson's residence, a sizable building known as The Knowle, was completed in 1851 some distance {{away from the other}} buildings, in the modern-day grounds of Fremantle Hospital. Houses for the senior staff were also constructed in the 1850s. They were situated {{at the front of the}} prison site, along the road then known as The Esplanade (modern day The Terrace).|$|E
5|$|Four months later, Dot is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> surgery to permanently fix her sight.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance and interactional justice on job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method was used to collect 107 usable questionnaires from employees who work in the US subsidiary manufacturing firm operating in a silicon valley in East Malaysia, Malaysia. Findings: The outcomes showed two important findings: first, relationship between interactional justice and adequacy <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> significantly correlated with job satisfaction. Second, relationship between interactional justice and participation in pay systems significantly correlated with job satisfaction. Statistically, this result confirms that interactional justice does act as a mediating variable in the <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance models <b>of</b> the studied organization. Originality/value: Most previous research tested a direct effect <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on job satisfaction. Unlike such research approach, this study discovers that interactional justice has strengthened the effect <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> performance on job satisfaction in a compensation system framewor...|$|R

25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E

Over the next hundred years, the size of the Army was controlled either by the number of serving men being strictly regulated or by limits on the money that paid for it. At the Diet of Worms in 1521 a commitment was made to keep the strength at 20,063 infantry and 4,202 cavalry. This was later simplified to 20,000 and 4,000.
