Magnus also discovers ties to a powerful secret organization, the Cabal, who had put the sisters into the crypt to be used again in the future.

5|$|Despite their {{territorial}} gains {{following the}} Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped {{to achieve the}} Megali Idea and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna and sought to take Ankara, with the aim <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.|$|E
5|$|In the game, players use a {{slingshot}} {{to launch}} birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures {{with the goal}} <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|Instead <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> confiscated ivory, a {{government}} {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E

5|$|Just days later, however, on 24 April 1918, Battleship Division Nine {{joined the}} Grand Fleet in one last {{attempt to bring}} the High Seas Fleet to battle. German Admiral Reinhard Scheer, aware of the {{strategic}} potential <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> a squadron of British battleships, had finally decided to make an attempt on the Scandinavian Convoy, using the overwhelming force of his entire fleet. Under strict radio silence, the High Seas Fleet sailed {{on the morning of}} 23 April to attempt an intercept, leaving the British completely unaware that they had left their base.|$|E
5|$|Once given {{freedom of}} action, Manstein {{intended}} to utilise his forces {{to make a}} series of counterstrokes into the flanks of the Soviet armoured formations, with the goal <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> them while retaking Kharkov and Kursk. The II SS Panzer Corps had arrived from France in January 1943, refitted and up to near full strength. Armoured units from the 1st Panzer Army of Army Group A had {{pulled out of the}} Caucasus and further strengthened Manstein's forces.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by the Allied {{offensive}} in the Solomons, Japanese naval forces (under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto) and army forces prepared a counteroffensive, {{with the goal}} of driving the Allies out of Guadalcanal and Tulagi.

5|$|The film {{is based}} on Ian Fleming's 1956 novel of the same name, and is the second of four James Bond films {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring, and soon uncovering a plot by his old nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his nemesis for one last time, to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> Washington, D.C., and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The module's plot {{revolves}} around {{the tomb of the}} demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> Acererak. Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by the staff of Dragon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E

5|$|When the han {{feudal system}} was {{abolished}} in 1871, Himeji Castle {{was put up}} for auction. The castle was purchased by a Himeji resident for 23 Japanese yen (about 200,000 yen or US$2,258 today). The buyer wanted to demolish the castle complex and develop the land, but the cost <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> the castle {{was estimated to be}} too great, and it was again spared.|$|E
5|$|With the {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> the Bulgarian Army, the French and British {{launched a new}} offensive in April 1917, without any significant success. A stalemate ensued without any movement by either side; the front became known as Europe's biggest internment camp for the Allies by the Germans. This situation lasted until 18 September 1918, when the British and Greek Armies, {{under the command of}} General George Milne attacked in the Lake Doiran Sector. The Bulgarian Army—now in retreat—signed an armistice on 30 September 1918.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing all the Tribals and {{restoring}} the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to the asteroid and confront Mizar. To {{the surprise of}} all though, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. Realising that destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> the asteroid, the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, a little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the asteroid. Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. The team returns to the starship and departs shortly before Floyd destroys the asteroid. Afterwards on Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces {{landed on}} Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under {{construction}} by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent {{attempts by the}} Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield, which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> Allied aircraft that posed {{a threat to the}} convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|As Pellew's {{squadron}} neared Griessie, {{a message}} {{arrived from the}} Dutch civilian governor at Sourabaya, reversing Cowell's orders and offering a full surrender. Pellew accepted the message and on 7 December his ships entered Griessie. However, during the time it had taken to exchange messages, Cowell had ordered that all shipping in Griessie harbour be destroyed to prevent the British gaining control of it. The ships were scuttled in shallow water, leaving only wrecked hulls for the British to claim. Pellew ordered the hulls burned, and British landing parties investigated the town, burning and destroying all military supplies and cannon they found. Another party landed at Sambelangan and demolished the battery there. Pellew withdrew on 11 December, his ambition <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies complete.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with {{superior}} specifications. This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means <b>of</b> <b>destroying</b> tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World WarI.|$|E
