The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{problems}} in Malaysia {{began in the}} late 1920s when motorised vehicles began to hover <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> used to be covered only by bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw and bullock carts. This situation creates a new task for the police forces, which is to maintain and control the traffic. In 1928 and 1929, the traffic branch was established in big cities, which is Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Seremban. Singapore, which at that time was part of Strait States have set up traffic branch earlier, which is in 1918. In other cities, the task of controlling the traffic falls on regular general duty policemen.|$|E
25|$|The Puntland Security Force {{began their}} counter-offensive on 3 December, though their forces were {{hindered}} by the difficult terrain around Qandala and narrow roads {{that led to}} the town. Government soldiers encountered first resistance at the village of Bashashin, when they were forced to stop in order to dismantle landmines that had been placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> ran through the village. At that moment, ISS militants launched a surprise attack, though the Puntland forces eventually repelled the assault. Another major skirmish happened on 5 December; besides these two battles, the fighting was mostly sporadic, though it lasted until 7 December. On that day, the Puntland forces entered Qandala by land and sea, encountering no resistance; ISS had evacuated its forces from the town beforehand and subsequently retreated to Gurur in the mountainous areas to the south.|$|E

25|$|Pre-facelift vs Facelift. In {{respect of}} FTO ownership, {{there is some}} {{division}} in preference for the styling of the front bumper - either Pre-facelift, or Facelift. Interchanging these units is a relatively simple matter and, as the latter version models have become write-offs over the years, there are many pre-facelift models now <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> are sporting newer facelift bumpers. Future purchasers of an FTO {{should be aware of}} this. A simple check of the VIN Plate details, or the period of manufacture to be found on the seat-belt tags, should resolve any uncertainty as to the origin of the model-build. Apart from body styling, there are other less apparent differences in the Facelift models, such as uprated ECU and also distinct variations to the drive shaft units across the range. Such as 25 or 27-spline shafts and CV cup variants, as well as fitment for ABS or non-ABS shafts and bearings for same.|$|E

That following off-season, the team drafted two players from behind the Iron Curtain, Arvydas Sabonis and Dražen Petrović, and sent Thompson to the San Antonio Spurs for former Oregon State University star Steve Johnson. Johnson was a high-scoring forward-center who the team intended to pair with Bowie on the frontline. It was not to be, as Bowie broke his leg five games into the 1986–87 season, missing the next two and a half seasons.

500|$|The janissaries, {{under the}} command of Mihaloğlu Ali Bey, pursued the Wallachians and killed 1,000-2,000 of them. According to the chronicle of the Venetan bailo at the Porte, Domenico Balbi, the total {{casualties}} for the conflict are numbered as 5,000 for the Wallachian side and 15,000 for the Ottomans. Even though the morale of the sultan and his army was low, Mehmed decided to besiege the capital, but instead found it deserted with its gates wide open. The Turkish army entered the capital and for half an hour, the army marched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> was bordered by some 20,000 impaled Turks. There, they found the rotten corpse of Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, to symbolize his 'high ranking'. Other sources say that the city was defended by the soldiers, while the impaled corpses lay outside the city-walls for a distance of 60 miles. Chalkokondyles, when remarking the reaction of the sultan, wrote: [...] "The sultan was seized with amazement and said that {{it was not possible to}} deprive of his country a man who had done such great deeds, who had such a diabolical understanding of how to govern his realm and its people.

500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I Want to Be with You Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. [...] "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the Billboard country chart.|$|E
500|$|The NFLPA {{began when}} two {{players from the}} Cleveland Browns, Abe Gibron and Dante Lavelli, {{approached}} a lawyer and former Notre Dame football player, Creighton Miller, to help form an association to advocate for the players. Miller was initially reluctant but accepted in 1956. He contacted Don Shula (a Baltimore Colts player at the time), John Gordy of the Detroit Lions, Frank Gifford and Sam Huff of the New York Giants, and Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams {{to aid in the}} development of the association. Representatives of 11 of the 12 teams in the league at the time joined the association; the Chicago Bears were the sole dissenter; by November 1956 a majority of the players signed cards allowing the NFLPA to represent them. The first meeting took place at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in November where players decided on demands to be submitted to league commissioner Bert Bell. The new association's initial agenda included a league-wide minimum salary, plus a per diem when teams were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>that</b> uniforms and equipment be paid for and maintained at the clubs' expense, and continued payment of salaries when players were injured. The NFLPA hoped to meet with Bell during the owners' meeting in January 1957 to discuss the demands; however, no meeting took place. The owners, for their part, were not enthused by the concept of a player's union and this sentiment was reflected when Miller, who served as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns, was removed from the team photo at the request of Paul Brown. Gibron, Lavelli, and Miller were instrumental in the founding of the union as they had become chagrined by Paul Brown's staunch view that [...] "it was both just and necessary that management could cut, trade, bench, blackball and own in perpetuity anyone and everyone that it wanted".|$|E
