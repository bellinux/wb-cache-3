5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion.

When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mansion</b> for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mansion.</b> Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their tax dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E

500|$|As a director, Manjrekar {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>mansion</b> shown in <b>the</b> film [...] "plays a major character" [...] and {{was certain that}} finding <b>the</b> appropriate <b>mansion</b> would be a difficult job.
