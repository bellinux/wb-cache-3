5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and <b>other</b> <b>retail</b> stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E

40|$|First paragraph: Planning {{is not a}} {{technical}} and value free activity (Tewdwr-Jones, 2002). There will always be conflicts of interest which must be resolved and some positions will be privileged over <b>others.</b> <b>Retail</b> planning in the last 40 years or so has oscillated between tighter controls on where development may take place to more pro-development positions (Guy, 2007 a). This reflects ongoing tensions between balancing commercial responsiveness and social responsibility, between fulfilling the ambitions of the retail industry and the aspirations of all consumers and between national consistency and local flexibility in decision taking...|$|R
