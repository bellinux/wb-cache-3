5000|$|Melittobia australica is an {{parasitoid}} and {{its primary}} hosts are solitary bees and wasps. Its life cycle {{starts with the}} female finding the nest of a suitable host where the progeny are in the prepupal stage. The female feeds on the prepupa, she punctures it with the ovipositor and feeds on the exuded body fluids, using the proteins in the ingested fluid for <b>ovogenesis.</b> She lays 10-50 eggs per day under the pupal covering of the host. Fertilised eggs develop into female wasps and unfertilised eggs into males, a behaviour known as arrhenotoky. The eggs are normally laid on a single host within the nest and many females may lay eggs on the same host which can be completely covered in larval M. australica of different ages which emerge from the eggs {{a few days after}} oviposition. The larvae feed on the tissue of the host and their development of the fames into the differing morphs is determined by the density of larvae feeding on the host. Where there is a low density of larvae the females will mainly be [...] "crawlers" [...] whereas intermediate densities will result in [...] "jumpers" [...] or and high densities of larvae will cause mostly [...] "fliers" [...] to develop. Where the host larvae are small the female may lay her eggs on more than one host.|$|E

40|$|The female {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} a Chasmagnathus granulatus population inhabiting the {{area near the}} mouth of Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina, was studied. An increase in air temperature during the spring is related {{to the start of the}} breeding period, when well defined egg-laying and hatching pulses were observed. Hatching is synchronic during the whole summer but the egg production was not, probably due to the gradual incorporation of young females to the reproductive population. Neither egg-laying nor larval release showed a clear relation to moon phase or tidal cycles, suggesting that reproduction is not rigidly programmed in this unpredictable habitat. Females moult at the beginning of autumn, after releasing the last larvae. However, a new cohort of ovocytes, which was in primary vitellogenesis before moulting, completed the secondary <b>ovogenesis</b> after moulting.

40|$|Digestive enzyme {{activity}} {{is often used}} as a sensitive response to environmental pollution. However, only {{little is known about}} the negative effects of stress on digestive capacities and their consequences on energy reserves and reproduction, although these parameters are important for the maintenance of populations. To highlight if changes in biochemical responses (digestive enzymes and reserves) led to impairments at an individual level (fertility), Gammarus fossarum were submitted to a lower food intake throughout a complete female reproductive cycle (i. e. from <b>ovogenesis</b> to offspring production). For both males and females, amylase activity was inhibited by the diet stress, whereas trypsin activity was not influenced. These results underline similar sensitivity of males and females concerning their digestive capacity. Energy reserves decreased with food starvation in females, and remained stable in males. The number of embryos per female decreased with food starvation. Lower digestive activity in males and females therefore appears as an early response. These results underline the ecological relevance of digestive markers, as they make it possible to anticipate upcoming consequences on reproduction in females, a key biological variable for population dynamics...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} genes differentially {{expressed in}} ovaries from lean (wild type) and obese (ob/ob) female mice and cyclic AMP production in both groups. METHODS: The expression on messenger RNA levels of 84 genes concerning obesity was analyzed through the PCR array, and cyclic AMP was quantified by the enzyme immunoassay method. RESULTS: The most downregulated {{genes in the}} Obesity Group included adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type 1, somatostatin, apolipoprotein A 4, pancreatic colipase, and interleukin- 1 beta. The mean decrease in expression levels of these genes was around 96, 40, 9, 4. 2 and 3. 6 -fold, respectively. On the other hand, the most upregulated genes in the Obesity Group were receptor (calcitonin) activity-modifying protein 3, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha, calcitonin receptor, and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1. The increase means in the expression levels of such genes were 2. 3, 2. 7, 4. 8 and 6. 3 -fold, respectively. The ovarian cyclic AMP production was significantly higher in ob/ob female mice (2, 229 ± 52 fMol) compared to the Control Group (1, 814 ± 45 fMol). CONCLUSIONS: Obese and anovulatory female mice have reduced reproductive hormone levels and altered <b>ovogenesis.</b> Several genes have their expression levels altered when leptin is absent, especially adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type 1...|$|E
40|$|Both {{during the}} <b>ovogenesis</b> and {{immediately}} after the laying is a bird egg exposed to strong pressure from the microorganisms which are able to penetrate the egg through eggshell pores and infect its inner structures. With regard to the proved negative effects on hatchability, viability and phenotype of offspring, a cascade of obstacles has evolved which are able {{to minimize the risk}} of bacterial infection. The deposition of antimicrobial components into the eggshell and the egg white is considered to be one of them. A whole group of egg white proteins belong to them, among which lysozyme and ovotransferrin, which are also partially deposited into the eggshell and cuticular layer of the eggshell, dominate with their antimicrobial effect. The implication of the newest studies is that the microbial protection of the egg can be also performed by the eggshell pigments - biliverdin and protoporphyrin, which protect the egg from being colonized by microorganisms with an increased UV light and regulation of conductivity and water vapour condensation on the egg surface. Even though the presence of these antimicrobial components in different structures of the egg has been proved, there is no known comparative study which addresses the relation between deposition of selected antimicrobial components into [...] ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Ovogenesis</b> and foliculogenesis in {{the mare}} differ from {{other farm animals}} and therefore, gamete manipulation, in vitro {{fertilization}} and embryo transfer have been very difficult. The histologic traits of ovaries from 12 mares, in estrus and diestrus were studied. Number and size of follicules and corpora lutea were recorded. The ovarian stroma was evaluated using the pricosirius technique for collagen. A simple morphometric analysis was done using computerized scanner programs. During late estrus, one dominant follicle (46 ± 4 mm) is seen. The surrounding stroma contains collagen I and III. By {{the end of the}} estrus, one hemorrhagic follicle is seen, plus one or two small follicle (2 mm in size). In early diestrus there is a corpus luteum (43 - 60 mm) and some antral follicles (6 ± 1). Collagen I forms strands inside the corpus luteum and predominates in the perifollicular ovarian stroma. Modifications of the extracellular matrix may change cell function by way of integrines, the matrix being in turn modified by hormones and other tissular factors. Estrogens can be related to collagen III predominance in ovarian stroma whereas progesterone is associated with increased collagen I. Therefore, follicular-stromal interactions are important in ovarian histophysiology. KEY WORDS: Follicle; Stroma; Mare ovary; Seasonality...|$|E

40|$|Female {{brown trout}} were sacrificed every month {{or twice a}} month during the {{reproductive}} season. Plasma gonadotropin (GtH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 - 17 beta) were measured using radioimmunological techniques, in relation with the state of gametogenesis. From ovulation to July egg's diameters remained less than 1 mm, and <b>ovogenesis</b> was characterized from the histological appearance of three types of vitellus: glycoproteique (type I), lipidique (type II), lipidoprotéique (type III), and the immunological plasma detection of the vitellogenin. During this period GtH levels remained lower than 1 ng/ml except in March, when they increased around 5 ng/ml, both with pituitary GtH and plasma E 2 17 beta. This rise occurred just before the appearance of the type III vitellus within the oocyte, and might correspond to a critical phase of the reproductive cycle during which vitellogenin could not be detected in 70 % of the animals. During rapid growth of the oocyte from 1 to 5 mm, mean GtH levels increased from 0. 75 to 2. 5 ng/ml when those of the E 2 - 17 beta increased more rapidly but began to drop before the end of vitellogenesis. Maturation and ovulation were accompanied by a rise of the GtH level, in correlation with the lower levels of E 2 - 17 beta measured during the cycle, GtH remained high even after ovulation, and more in fish which had kept their eggs within the body cavity. Correlation among GtH, E 2 - 17 beta, and the diameters of eggs had been calculated. There was a positive correlation among GtH, E 2 - 17 beta levels, and the diameters of eggs during exogenous vitellogenesis, and a negative between GtH and E 2 - 17 beta {{at the end of the}} reproductive cycle.

40|$|The blue spiny lizard, Sceloporus cyanogenys, an {{ovoviviparous}} lizard from Texas and Mexico was {{studied in}} order to contribute further information to the physiology of reproduction in reptiles. Seasonal Changes in gonadal microanatomy and the sex accessories could be demonstrated in this lizard as a criteria for the reproductive activity of testicular and ovarian tissue. The animal has a single breeding season which occurs during the winter months. Spermatogensis commences in August, followed immediately by a period of speriogenesis; producing nature sperm, which are shed into the epididymides and vas deferens prior to the time ovulation occurs in the female. Interstitial cells were seen to develop and regress with the waxing and waving of the sex accessories and secondary sexual characters. These sex accessories were demonstrated {{to be under the}} influence of the male sex hormone, testosterone. <b>Ovogenesis</b> and yoik deposition begins in Autumn; producing large eggs which are ovulated during mid-winter. A corpus luteum is formed from the old Graffian follicle. Stages in the developement of this structure are presented. Seasonal changes in the oviduct appear to be controlled by ovarian estrogens. Gestation lasts approximately four months, Apposition between fetuses and oviducal epithelium is loose. A demonstration of the ovoviviparous nature of the lizard indicates that there is no exchange between oviduct and fetuses, other than water and possibly gases. Mating behavior and parturition is described. The average number of young born to an adult female is 17. 68. Mammalian gonadotrophins were incapable of inducing another reproductive cycle in females with quiescent ovaries; but oxytocin was able to facilitate parturition.

40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFR) such as hexachlorocyclopentadienyl-dibromocyclooctane (HCDBCO), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (BEHTBP), 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) are {{contaminants}} of environmental concern. These BFRs are replacement alternatives {{for some of}} the major production BFRs, which have been restricted from the marketplace due to their adverse health effects. Their presence in environmental matrices, including wild birds, suggests they should be tested for possible toxic effects. BFR alternatives have been detected in the eggs of colonial fish-eating birds, suggesting maternal transfer during <b>ovogenesis</b> and the potential for these chemicals to bioaccumulate through the food chain. However, information regarding the toxicity of HCDBCO, BEHTBP, BTBPE and DBDPE exposure in birds is lacking. This thesis consisted of a combined in vitro/in ovo approach to determine: 1) the concentration-dependent effects of these four BFR alternatives in chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH), and 2) the dose-dependent effects of HCDBCO and BTBPE in chicken embryos following injection into the air cell of eggs prior to incubation. Changes in the mRNA expression levels of genes previously found to be responsive to other BFRs were assessed in CEH and liver tissue, in addition to examining overt toxicity (i. e. cytotoxicity, pipping success). None of the BFRs tested were cytotoxic up to 60 µM HCDBCO, 60 µM BEHTBP, 1. 4 µM BTBPE or 0. 2 µM DBDPE in CEH. Injection doses up to 50 µg/g egg HCDBCO and 10 µg/g egg BTBPE had no effect on embryonic pipping success. The accumulation of HCDBCO and BTBPE was variable in liver and did not follow a linear uptake pattern with respect to injection dose, due in part to difficulties with the solubility of these chemicals in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle. In, CEH, HCDBCO caused a decrease in CYP 1 A 4 / 5 mRNA at all concentrations tested, while CYP 2 H 1 and CYP 3 A 37 were induced only at 10 µM. In contrast, only TTR mRNA was down-regulated in hepatic tissue at all injection concentrations of HCDBCO. The highest concentration of BTBPE induced CYP 1 A 4 / 5 mRNA to 115 - and 18 -fold in CEH, and 6. 5 - and 1. 8 -fold in liver tissue. In vitro and in ovo exposure to BTBPE caused a concentration-dependent decrease in DIO 3 mRNA, while CYP 3 A 37 was down-regulated 2 -fold at 10 µg/g in liver tissue. In CEH, DBDPE induced CYP 1 A 4 / 5 mRNA to a maximum of 29 - and 59 -fold at 0. 2 µM, and increases in DIO 1 mRNA and decreases in CYP 3 A 37 mRNA were also observed. None of the gene targets were responsive to BEHTBP exposure in CEH. This is the first study to report on the toxicological and molecular effects of HCDBCO, BEHTBP, BTBPE and DBDPE in an avian species. Using this combined in vitro/in ovo approach has permitted the characterization of these four BFR alternatives by defining possible mechanisms of biological action in a model avian species, the chicken...|$|E
