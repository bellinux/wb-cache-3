D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to very toxic to marine life in different countries.|$|E

2500|$|Limonene {{is common}} in {{cosmetic}} products. As the main odor constituent of citrus (plant family Rutaceae), d-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, e.g. as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other such products that include fragrance. d-Limonene is also used as botanical insecticide. d-Limonene {{is used in the}} organic herbicide [...] "Avenger." [...] It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon-orange fragrance (see <b>orange</b> <b>oil)</b> and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, l-limonene has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} citrus peel <b>oils</b> (<b>orange,</b> lemon, bergamot) as food supplementation in different levels on performance, microflora and morphology in broilers. The trial consisted of 1 -day-old male and female Ross 308 chicks (250 male 250 female). The study consisted of 10 groups in total and each group was replicated five times. Experimental diets were prepared by adding orange, lemon and bergamot peel oil levels (1, 2 and 3 mL/kg) to basal diet. It was observed that the supplementation of citrus peel oils to the diet improved significantly the feed conversion rate. Especially the lowest feed intake and the best feed conversion ratio were received from broilers which were fed 3 mL/kg of <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil.</b> The study shows that the count of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and lactic acid bacteria in the jejunum decreased significantly with the supplementation of bergamot peel oil to broilers diets. Citrus peel oil, in contrast to bergamot peel oil, significantly increased lactic acid bacteria count. The highest lactic acid bacteria count was determined in birds fed 3 mL/kg with <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil.</b> In {{the result of this}} study, both the length and density of villi and the density of blood and lymphatic capillary in the jejunum increased significantly by dietary 3 mL/kg <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> supplementation. Finally, our results indicate that, especially 3 mL/kg <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> has positive effects on performance, jejunum microflora, and jejunum morphology.

Fuel samples were prepared with different concentrations of water in <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel (94 % waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel[*]+[*] 4 % water[*]+[*] 2 % Span 80 (WOPOBDE 1) and 90 % waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel[*]+[*] 8 % water[*]+[*] 2 % Span 80 (WOPOBDE 2). Span 80 was employed as a nonionic surfactant, which emulsifies water in biodiesel. Experimental results revealed that the nitrogen oxides and smoke emission of <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel emulsion were reduced by 11 %– 19 % and 3 %– 21 %, respectively, {{compared to that of}} neat <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel (WOPOBD). In addition, the introduction of orange peel oil–water emulsions in the diesel engine considerably reduced the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The overall hydrocarbon emission of WOPOBDE 2 was 12.2 % lower than that of WOPOBD and 16.3 % lower than that of diesel. The overall CO emission of WOPOBDE 2 was 17 % lower than that of base fuel (WOPOBD) and 21.8 % lower than that of diesel. Experimental results revealed that modified fuel had higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific fuel consumption than that of base fuel at all engine brake power levels.|$|R

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} to elucidate the performance and emission patterns of an engine fueled by neat waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel (WOPOBD) and its various water blends. In this study, Span 80 as a nonionic surfactant was used for emulsifying water and biodiesel. Earlier reported literature is the motivation for choosing Span 80 as a surfactant (Devarajan and Madhavan 2017; Vellaiyan and Amirthagadeswaran 2017 a; Arul Gnana Dhas et al. 2018). This study employed four fuels, namely diesel, waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel (WOPOBD), fuel comprising 4 % (in volume) of water, 94 % (in volume) of neat waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel and 2 % (in volume) span 80 (WOPOBDE 1), and fuel comprising 8 % (in volume) of water, 90 % (in volume) of neat waste <b>orange</b> peel <b>oil</b> biodiesel and 2 % (in volume) Span 80 (WOPOBDE 2) in a constant speed compression ignition engine. The emission and performance characteristics of all the test fuels were investigated and compared with the baseline diesel at ambient conditions.|$|R
