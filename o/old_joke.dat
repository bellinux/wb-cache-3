25|$|Eventually, Estragon dozes off and Vladimir rouses him {{but then}} stops {{him before he}} can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. Estragon wants to hear an <b>old</b> <b>joke,</b> which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{although most}} reviewers found {{some of the}} storylines more effective than others. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that [...] "the main portion of this episode was quite funny, even if the ending lacked bite." [...] Similarly, Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was [...] "another strong showing for 30 Rock... although Jenna's plotline was pretty tired." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone was similarly positive about [...] "The Bubble", calling it [...] "another good episode." [...] James Poniewozik of Time, also responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception of}} the Jenna storyline, writing that it [...] "was the first one in a long time that I enjoyed almost completely without reservation (Jenna's subplot was off, but it was barely a blip)." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked the bubble concept, reporting, [...] "he idea that attractive people get away with things that the more average-looking can't is an <b>old</b> <b>joke,</b> even on 30 Rock (with Cerie)", but nonetheless enjoyed the [...] "variations" [...] of the joke saying they were [...] "well-conceived". Sepinwall concluded, [...] "this was one of the funniest 30 Rocks of the season. Zap2it's Rick Porter was also favorable to [...] "The Bubble" [...] in his recap, opining that 30 Rock [...] "gave us a very well-done episode". As with Lyons and Poniewozik, Porter felt Jenna's story [...] "didn't really click", but liked the scene with Jenna and her stylist team firing off words to describe Jenna's beauty as [...] "scathingly funny." ...|$|E

During the Scandinavian tour, the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the <b>old</b> <b>joke</b> by Keith Moon and John Entwistle.

While {{he noted that the}} construction costs of the building worked out to $2,500 per square metre, $500 higher than the Canadian average, that was not so much when the additional costs of building in the North and government project management requirements were factored in.

2500|$|This <b>old</b> <b>joke</b> {{has become}} part of the {{folklore}} of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. According to The New York Times, the main player in the story has been described at various times as either an unnamed man, violinist Jascha Heifetz or the pianist Arthur Rubinstein. On its webpage, Carnegie Hall quotes the wife of violinist Mischa Elman as having perhaps the best story of its origin: [...] "One day, after a rehearsal that hadn’t pleased Elman, the couple was leaving Carnegie Hall by the backstage entrance when they were approached by two tourists looking for the hall’s entrance. Seeing his violin case, they asked, 'How do you get to Carnegie Hall?' Without looking up and continuing on his way, Elman simply replied, 'Practice.'" ...|$|E

[...] At this point, Sammy Davis, Jr. walks onstage behind Jack, the audience screams, and Davis proceeds to speak and sing and dance for about 25 minutes while Benny continues to stand at center stage, quietly watching the spectacle. When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience's applause dies down, Benny continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments, then, as the audience is finally quiet, continues: [...] "... So the farmer said—" [...] And that's as far as that joke got, because the audience laughed for minutes afterward.|$|E

[...] This might be a conscious echo of the opening of Melville's Moby-Dick: [...] "Call me Ishmael," [...] or perhaps a contemporary bathos. The title of the novella alludes to an <b>old</b> <b>joke,</b> also alluding to Moby-Dick. One of Sam's friends tells a shaggy dog story of a man who goes to India to study yoga, echoing Pip's passing mention of a joke in Melville's novel: he unscrews his navel, thinking he {{is on the verge of}} a revelation, and his ass falls off. This instance seems to suggest Sam's reluctance or inability to take risks or do anything to break the monotony of his routine life. His navel gazing is what makes him the object of Mailer's scorn and drains his life of significance.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{kinds of}} jokes have been {{identified}} in ancient pre-classical texts. The <b>oldest</b> identified <b>joke</b> was found to be an ancient Sumerian proverb from 1900 BC containing toilet humour: [...] "Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap." [...] Its records were dated to the Old Babylonian period and the joke may go as far back as 2,300 BC. The second <b>oldest</b> <b>joke</b> found, discovered on the Westcar Papyrus and believed to be about Sneferu, was from Ancient Egypt circa 1600 BC: [...] "How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish." [...] The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known <b>oldest</b> <b>jokes</b> in the world. This is a comic triple dating back to 1200 BC Adab.. These [...] "oldest" [...] jokes have two things in common: firstly, they were all written down, and secondly, their structure is remarkably similar to modern day jokes.|$|R

2500|$|Podge {{originally}} {{appeared as}} a [...] "villain" [...] character on the children's programming block, The Den. He was introduced in 1990, as an ordinary puppet that Zag (of Zig and Zag) had found in a box amongst the rubbish behind an <b>old</b> <b>joke</b> shop. Dubbing the puppet [...] "Podge," [...] Zag used him to practise ventriloquism, and would put on the [...] "Podge and Zag" [...] show, which a jealous Zig usually interrupted. Things took a sinister turn one day, when during one of these shorts, a mysterious voice said to Zag, [...] "aren't you a smelly stupid ugly alien". Soon after, the truth of Podge was revealed to the audience: alone with Zig {{at the conclusion of}} the broadcasting day, he showed that he was actually alive, moving and speaking on his own, bullying Zig and telling him he would be his friend if he stole the bike presently being offered as a competition prize. Zag and presenter Ray D'Arcy remained oblivious to Podge's true nature for some time; Podge would occasionally move in the background during continuity announcements between programmes, or be seen scheming on his own, and letters and pictures would pour in from the viewing children trying to let them know that the little puppet was evil. Eventually, after Zig finally told Zag and Ray the truth, Podge made a power play and took over the programme for a day, revealing that he had been brought to life by a magician, but then sealed away when he turned evil. Podge also possessed some magical powers of his own that he'd learned from the magician, and turned one of the crew members into a teapot. He was finally dealt with when the magician arrived at the end of the programming day, hypnotised Podge (who the magician called [...] "Albert"), and took him away.|$|E
