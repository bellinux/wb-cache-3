The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this request was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks to pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister <b>of</b> <b>economy</b> to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{strategic}} {{theory of}} resource-based view (RBV) put Penrose (1959) in the spotlight. The {{key to understanding}} Penrose’s assertion is the concept <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth independent <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size. According to Penrose, even when <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> size are not working, <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth exist regardless of size. Further, the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth are temporary in nature and disappear once expansion is completed. In which managerial services are the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth embodied? This paper hypothesizes that the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> growth occur where there are unused start-up expert managerial services. Regardless of size, where these services exist, paving the company’s way by step-by-step growth should produce profits...|$|R

5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister <b>of</b> <b>Economy</b> was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister <b>of</b> <b>Economy.</b> During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces <b>of</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
