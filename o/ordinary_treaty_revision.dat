40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Portuguese Presidency at Feira represents the latest stage in a process set into motion eighteen months earlier. The implications of the Feira conclusions for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) fall more into the maximalist camp (meaning {{that there is a}} need for significant <b>treaty</b> <b>revision)</b> given the ambitious deadline of the ‘Headline Goals’. It is argued that the Amsterdam <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> did not provide for sufficient flexibility in the security and defence areas and it is therefore imperative that <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> be addressed, even in the recesses of the ‘parallel’ IGC meeting on CFSP. Importantly, this effort must also be supported by the commitment of the necessary resources at the Capabilities Commitment Conference in November. Failure to do so risks ESDP becoming no more than bonnes paroles...|$|R
50|$|On 23 October 1932, Mussolini {{declared}} {{support for}} a Four Power Directorate that included Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, to bring about an orderly <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> outside of what he considered the outmoded League of Nations. The proposed Directorate was pragmatically designed to reduce French hegemony in continental Europe, {{in order to reduce}} tensions between the great powers in the short term to buy Italy relief from being pressured into a specific war alliance {{while at the same time}} allowing them to benefit from diplomatic deals on <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the EU’s Common Commercial Policy (CCP) at {{the level}} of <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision</b> and particularly focuses on the last Treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Lisbon. The analysis is based on a revised neofunctionalist framework that the author developed in previous work. It draws on the following concepts: (i) functional spillover; (ii) cultivated spillover; (iii) social spillover; and (iv) countervailing forces. Insights into the dynamics and countervailing forces driving <b>Treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> considerably deepen our understanding of the Common Commercial Policy, as EU external trade policy-making is substantially affected by the parameters set by the Treaty. The analysis indicates that the revised neofunctionalist framework can broadly account for the changes of the Common Commercial Policy during the last <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> It is further suggested that integration in the area of trade policy cannot be explained exclusively by rational choice dynamics, such as utility maximizing actors with fixed preferences, but that socialization through deliberation also needs to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|In {{the heat}} of the {{economic}} crisis, the demands for <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> have re-emerged in the EU agenda. However, any future reform {{will have to deal with}} the strictness of the revision procedure, which is caused by the obstacles that the combination of the unanimity requirement and powerful veto players may create at any moment during ratification. The alternatives are not particularly attractive, since they have significant political costs and effects. Caught between a set of less than optimal alternatives for proceeding with <b>treaty</b> <b>revision,</b> the European Union seems placed between a rock and a hard place. This paper explores whether revision is at all feasible under current or alternative procedures, and argues that any option is sub-optimal...|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom of the Netherlands {{proposed}} a <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> on 4 June 1962. This proposal {{was met with}} favourable responses from the Commission, the Assembly, and the Council on 10 September, 19 October, and 22 October, respectively. An Intergovernmental Conference was convened on 13 November, which signed the Convention.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, the Gen'yōsha {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} unequal <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> plan drafted by foreign minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. A Gen'yōsha member threw a bomb which wounded him severely. In {{the election of}} 1892, the Gen'yōsha mounted a campaign of intimidation and violence with the tacit support of the Matsukata administration to influence {{the outcome of the}} election.|$|R

50|$|TFEU Article 355(6), {{introduced}} by the Treaty of Lisbon allows the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories to be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full <b>treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an overseas country or territory (OCT) to an outermost region (OMR) or vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system of}} treaty ports ended in Japan {{in the years}} 1899 as a {{consequence}} of Japan's rapid transition to a modern nation. Japan had sought <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> earnestly, and in 1894, signed a new treaty with Britain which revised or abrogated the previous [...] "unequal" [...] treaty. Other countries signed similar treaties. The new treaties came into force in July 1899.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1870 s Yukichi Fukuzawa claimed that Japan must {{have its own}} {{domestic}} order compatible with the coming new international order so that Japan could be independent in the world. Fukuzawa had predicted and apprehended the possible difficulties resulting from impending permeation of the Occidental civilization over into Japan, however, he had not referred to with what images of Japan the Occidental Powers came to Japan to knock on its door. This article attempts {{to find out what}} Fukuzawa had imagined of the Occidental images of Japan in the Meiji era by analyzing the history of negotiation with the Occidental Powers for the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Revision</b> carried out by the Meiji Imperial Government of Japan, and Fukuzawa's opinion on this issue. Fukuzawa led the public opinion on how to cope with this issue by his editorial articles on JIJI SHIMPO watching how the government's negotiation for the <b>Treaty</b> <b>Revision</b> developed. The writer thinks both are good resources abundant in the information we need...|$|R
40|$|The new 'Lisbon Treaty' agreed at the European Council {{meeting on}} 18 - 19 October 2007, {{preserves}} {{most of the}} substance of the failed Constitution; it will serve the EU well.

40|$|How {{legitimate}} are the EU's <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> procedures, that is, IGCs and the Convention? Since {{the rejection}} of the Constitutional Treaty the recurrence to intergovernmental procedures appears as one way out of the current dilemma. We argue instead that the Convention method is not to blame for the current crisis. On the contrary, it increases the legitimacy of EU constitutionalization considerably.

50|$|A {{passerelle}} clause is {{a clause}} in treaties of the European Union {{that allows the}} alteration of a legislative procedure without a formal amendment of the treaties. The use of a passerelle clause required unanimity of all member states although member states with opt-outs and those not participating in an area under enhanced cooperation {{may not have a}} vote. Unlike formal <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> their use does not require national ratification. Passerelle is French for a small bridge.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{economic}} and fiscal crisis and the institutional instruments created to deal with it have led several actors (from governments and EU bodies to scholars) to propose different EU reforms. Several options exist to accommodate future constitutional development which, in some cases, may require <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> In this case, future constitutional evolution faces the challenge that the very stringent EU revision requirement (i. e. unanimity) poses. Other available options do not seem totally satisfactory...|$|R
50|$|Remón did {{not live}} to see the {{culmination}} of the major <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> he initiated. In 1953 Remón had visited Washington to discuss basic revisions of the 1936 treaty. Among other things, Panamanian officials wanted a larger share of the canal tolls, and merchants continued to be unhappy with the competition from the nonprofit commissaries in the Canal Zone. Remón also demanded that the discriminatory wage differential in the zone, which favored United States citizens over Panamanians, be abolished.|$|R
40|$|Much of the Europeanization debate {{revolves}} around the impact of Brussels on the domestic legislatures of the member states, in particular the domination of their legislatures by the binding and enforceable activities of the EU. Because this impact {{is a direct result}} of the amount of legislative activities at the EU level, this chapter documents EU legislative decision-making and explores the consequences of <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> and enlargements, which have changed the goals and conditions for EU legislative decision-making over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{decrease}} in {{the rule of law}} and in control of corruption in several EU countries is a threat to the cohesion in the EU. Brexit has reinforced the centrifugal forces in the EU. To counter this threat the EU needs to engage in unpopular measures as they infringe on the Member States' sovereignty. We propose to introduce new measures in <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> like the possibility of individuals to appeal to European courts to counter negative developments in governance in EU Member States...|$|R
50|$|Under Kellogg, Johnson {{continually}} opposed {{interference in}} the civil war in China. He opposed joining the British at Canton and Hankow in punitive measures against Chinese strike pickets and other nationalists. He opposed harsh or recriminatory action against China during the Nanking Incident of 1927. He advocated conciliation in answering China's note of June 1925 requesting <b>treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> He suggested going as far as possible, unilaterally if necessary, in writing a new tariff treaty, and favored gradual relinquishment of extraterritoriality.|$|R
50|$|The Convention on the {{association}} of the Netherlands Antilles with the European Economic Community is an international agreement amending the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, {{with the aim of}} awarding OCT status to the Netherlands Antilles, which was a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 1954 until 2010. A full <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> was needed because Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Luxembourg wanted to add a protocol on the import of refined petroleum products from the Netherlands Antilles.|$|R
40|$|Som svar på den finanskris som bröt ut i Grekland, beslutade Europeiska Rådet att genom en ändring i Fördraget om Europeiska Unionens Funktionssätt tillåta införandet av en stabilitetsmekanism för att garantera stabiliteten i euro-området. Det är första gången man har utnyttjat ett av de två förfarandena för ”förenklad” fördragsändring som infördes med Lissabonfördraget. Den här analysen beskriver förfarandena, granskar skälen bakom Europeiska Rådets beslut samt diskuterar de steg som hittills har tagits i fördragsändringsarbetet. Analysen ingår i forskningsprojektet 'Långsiktiga effekter av den ekonomiska krisen'. On 25 March 2011, the European Council {{adopted a}} {{decision}} aiming at the amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union {{by the addition}} of a new paragraph to Article 136 of that Treaty. The additional paragraph, consisting of two short sentences, runs as follows: “The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality. ” This is the first use made of one of the two ‘simplified’ <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision</b> procedures which were created by the Lisbon Treaty. In this paper, the Lisbon reform of the <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision</b> procedures will first be described in general terms. Two other initiatives for post-Lisbon <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> will then be mentioned; both relate to the composition of the European Parliament and do not involve the use of the simplified revision procedure. The paper will then explain the reasons why the European Council considered it necessary to amend the TFEU in order to contribute to the smooth functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, there will be a discussion of the various steps taken so far in this amendment process which is scheduled to be finished by January 2013, after approval of the amendment from the side of each of the 27 EU states...|$|R
40|$|Taking a longue durée {{approach}} to EU political legitimacy, the paper examines three successive constitutional models of European integration: the transnational political movement {{for a democratic}} federal constitution; the ‘constitutional moment’ of 2001 – 2005; and the European de facto constitutionalization through progressive <b>treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> The attempt to draft a Constitution for Europe showed the limits of supranational democracy in that it maintained the intergovernmental design of <b>treaty</b> <b>revision,</b> and finally crashed against the scepticism {{of a number of}} national voters. What is left is the mixed kind of legitimation that results from the successive treaty revisions: input legitimacy (through the European and the national parliaments, states’ governments representation in Council, social dialogue, and participatory democracy), output legitimacy, and rule of law. This mixed model is exactly what is now put into question. The multiple crises that the EU currently experiences seem open to three different developments: an unlikely new edition of the federal dream; the transformation of the EU into an ‘empire’ with one or more clear hegemonic countries; the reinforcement of informal, inclusive governance as a further implementation of the path inaugurated with the Lisbon Treaty. A mixed, but mainly intergovernmental strengthening of (economic) governance is still the most realistic path out of the crisis and towards enhanced political union...|$|R
6000|$|Since that auspicious date {{it seems}} that the {{questions}} have impertinently come up, and the first and the last of them is that of <b>Treaty</b> <b>Revision.</b> Says the Japanese Government, 'Only obey our laws, our new laws that we have carefully compiled from all the wisdom of the West, and you shall go up country as you please and trade where you will, instead of living cooped up in concessions and being judged by consuls.

40|$|The European Commission {{has broken}} new ground in proposing to {{streamline}} national planning approval of vital energy infrastructure, use EU funds to leverage private finance for such networks and to negotiate foreign pipelines on the EU’s behalf. These initiatives coincide awkwardly with the eurozone crisis. But David Buchan broadly endorses Brussels’ attempt to kick-start implementation of Europe’s 2020 energy and climate goals. He suggests the Commission go {{a step further}} by taking advantage of the forthcoming <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> to propose a constitutional amendment on EU states’ energy mix...|$|R
40|$|The 2001 Declaration of Laeken inaugurated {{the most}} ambitious and open EU <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision</b> process so far. Most notably, the Laeken Declaration {{established}} a European Convention to prepare the new Treaty, which included political representatives from both the European and national level. Two negative referendum outcomes in Spring 2005 have however brought the Laeken process to a standstill. How can this <b>Treaty</b> <b>revision</b> process that was designed towards greater popular engagement have failed were the preceding ones (which were much more closed) succeeded? To answer this question, this paper focuses on {{the contrast between the}} successful establishment of a body (the Convention) for democratic deliberation at the supranational level and the problems of embedding the Constitutional Treaty debate within the national political spheres of the EU member states. I argue that while the European Convention may have succeeded in terms of deliberation, it failed in terms of public engagement. In a broader perspective, the Convention experience suggests that democratised European decision-making procedures cannot substitute for domestic democratic institutions. As European institutions lack the ability to prompt processes of democratic opinion formation in the member states, they can only operate successfully if they are complemented by a reinforced engagement of domestic institutions. Hence, a well-functioning multilevel democracy requires systematic linkages between supranational and national institutions, which remain underdeveloped in the EU so far...|$|R
40|$|How World Trade Organization (WTO) rules {{relate to}} human rights norms, and whether one takes {{precedence}} over {{the other in the}} event of conflict remains a subject of contention. This article aims to demonstrate why human rights have primacy over WTO rules. Three lines of argument are advanced here. First, trade is merely a means to advance socioeconomic ends (most of which are recognized as human rights). Should conflict arise between the two, it remains to reason that the end must trump the means. Second, while WTO rules are <b>ordinary</b> <b>treaty</b> rules of reciprocal nature, at least certain human rights norms have peremptory status. Moreover, the U. N. Charter is the foundation for modern human rights law. Thus, the overriding character of the U. N. Charter, it is argued here, accords human rights a superior value compared to <b>ordinary</b> <b>treaty</b> rules. Finally, their peremptory status notwithstanding, human rights are distinct in that they are not statutory norms; they are inherent, inalienable, and universal entitlements of individuals, not of states. On the contrary, human rights are primarily meant to constrain {{the power of the state}} (including its contractual power) vis-d-vis the individual. Therefore, human rights transcend the reciprocal interests of trading nations...|$|R
25|$|A new {{provision}} in the Treaty of Lisbon is that the status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories can be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full <b>treaty</b> <b>revision.</b> Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an overseas country or territory (OCT) to an outermost region (OMR) or vice versa. This provision was included on a proposal by the Netherlands, which was investigating {{the future of the}} Netherlands Antilles and Aruba in the European Union as part of an institutional reform process that was taking place in the Netherlands Antilles.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{intergovernmental}} {{nature of the}} permanent lending mechanism, which was named the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the simplified <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> procedure {{could be used for}} the TFEU amendment as the EU's powers were not being increased. [...] However, the amendment would not fulfill the German demand that the removal of voting rights be a possible sanction, as that would require a deeper treaty amendment. The treaty was designed so there would be no need for referendums, allowing for a speedy ratification process, with the aim to have it come into force in July 2012.|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this paper was {{presented}} at the Workshop “Revising European Treaties”, organised by the RSCAS/EUI on 11 November 2013. This working paper explores the challenges and opportunities of a possible euro area flexibility clause. Such a clause, if introduced through a limited revision of the current EU Treaties, could be used to partially respond to one of the institutional challenges exposed by the Eurozone crisis, namely that member states (permanently) outside the euro area can block change desired by the member states within the euro area. It would provide an alternative to a comprehensive <b>treaty</b> <b>revision</b> and to going outside the treaties by concluding additional intergovernmental treaties...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to account for the varying, and sometimes puzzling, outcomes of the past three <b>Treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> of EU/EC visa, asylum and immigration policy. The article focuses on decision rules and the institutional set-up of these policies, subjecting the results of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations leading to the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and the Constitutional Treaty to causal analysis. The article maintains that four factors can explain the various Treaty outcomes: (i) functional pressures; (ii) the role of supranational institutions; (iii) socialization, deliberation and learning processes; and (iv) countervailing forces.

5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions,</b> Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 <b>treaty</b> <b>revisions</b> and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|R
