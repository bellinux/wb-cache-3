5|$|Philip then ordered {{another attack}} on Athens; his army {{failed to take}} either Athens or Eleusis, but {{subjected}} Attica to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Romans and the situation in Greece. Thus began the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|But in that month, Constans was in {{his turn}} overthrown and killed by the usurper Magnentius, a laetus from Gaul who was comes (commander) of an elite brigade in Constans' comitatus (imperial escort army). In the East, Constantius had been engaged in a lengthy war against the Persians under Shah Shapur II (337-350). But he {{immediately}} concluded a truce in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Magnentius. He led his own comitatus to Illyricum where he assumed also command of the local comitatus, bringing his combined strike force to about 60,000. Magnentius gathered an army consisting of the Gaul comitatus (c. 25,000 men) and probably some Frankish and Saxon foederati (allies) and marched into Illyricum to confront Constantius. (For explanation of the term comitatus, see Late Roman army).|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the problem. A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the air density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E

He left them in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the intruder. Thirty seconds later, they witnessed an explosion and a CR.42 {{fall to the ground}} while Pattle rejoined them. It is believed he attacked a reconnaissance Dornier Do 17 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ("dive bomber wing 2") which he claimed destroyed, though it appears it made it back to German lines damaged. On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia and left a number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E

To make up for the loss of the Airborne Division, General Trưởng ordered the 369th Marines Brigade to replace the 3rd Airborne Brigade in Quảng Nam Province, and the 258th Marines Brigade to take over from the 2nd Airborne Brigade on Mount Phu Gia, located north of Hai Van.|$|E
5|$|As {{events in}} Ngok Tavak unfolded, White sent urgent {{messages}} to Company C, 5th Special Forces Headquarters in Đà Nẵng, {{as well as}} to the Americal Division, to request support. In response, the 5th Special Forces Headquarters ordered Captain Eugene Makowski to fly to Khâm Đức, where he would assume command of the 12th Mobile Strike Force Company, to reinforce White's beleaguered soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Then, just before sunrise, Colonel Trí ordered the 40th Battalion to pull out of Ngok Tavak in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> an enemy relief force, and leave behind only a blocking force to hold the captured positions inside the garrison. Following those events, Australian Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas mounted a counter-attack using a handful of Nung soldiers in an attempt to retake captured positions. At that point, those Marines who had survived the main battle decided to join the fight, and as the Australian-led formation moved through the Ngok Tavak garrison, they gradually pushed the last remaining enemy soldiers beyond the defensive perimeter.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 April, the Viet Cong's 5th Division launched another major ground assault on Lộc Ninh from the west to try {{to break through the}} defenses of the southern compound. American AC-130 and AH-1 Cobra gunships stopped the Viet Cong formations in their tracks, as supporting North Vietnamese tanks were either destroyed or forced to pull back. Despite having suffered many casualties as a result of U.S. air strikes, the Viet Cong continued their assaults well into the evening. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the onslaught, Smith continued to direct the AC-130 Spectres against targets around Lộc Ninh. Vinh, on the other hand, was either planning to surrender or desert when he ordered two of his soldiers to open the gates of the command compound at around 10 pm. Throughout the night, the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command continued bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Lộc Ninh, as the Viet Cong massed for another assault.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival of}} aggressive new enemies– Turks {{in the east}} and Normans in the west– was another contributory factor. In 1040, the Normans, originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder, began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them, a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042. Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign, but before it could be concluded he was recalled to Constantinople. Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With opposition thus absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071.|$|E
50|$|To {{answer the}} {{question}} of whether or not the same was true in helicopter-vs-fighter encounters, a selection of F-4, A-7, A-10 and F-15 aircraft were selected by the Air Force to take part in the tests. The F-4 and F-15 represented front-line fighters who might be <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> helicopters as part of their anti-air roles, while the A-7 and A-10 represented ground-attack aircraft who might encounter helicopters as part of their missions near the front lines.|$|R

5|$|Napoleon {{would end}} up leaving Iberia in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War {{continued}} on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during {{this phase of the}} conflict. The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations. The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favor of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of a mile or so to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous night would contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug around the perimeter of the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged cross-hatched to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E
