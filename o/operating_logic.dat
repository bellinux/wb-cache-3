50|$|Originally {{intended}} {{to provide a more}} efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of digital control systems allowed for flexibility in integrating distributed sensors and <b>operating</b> <b>logic</b> while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction. This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these digital control systems have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system. While the control theory applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of digital control systems upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for cybersecurity due to potential effects on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. To achieve resilience in the next generation of control systems, therefore, addressing the complex control system interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.|$|E

While {{there is now a}} large literature on constitutional change in Britain, most of these studies focus on individual institutions and neglect the reforms’ collective nature and effects. To develop a more unified analysis of the reforms and their consequences, we need an account of what institutions are and of how they work. Economic analyses of institutions provide such an account, helping us to identify the common <b>operating</b> <b>logics</b> that underpin different institutions along with their effects.

The Dynamic (G 2) Flowsheet is a discrete-time process model that enables the project to evaluate impacts to throughput from eventdriven activities such as pumping, sampling, storage, recycle, separation, and chemical reactions. The model is developed by the Process Engineering (PE) department, {{and is based on}} the Flowsheet Bases, Assumptions, and Requirements Document (24590 -WTP-RPT-PT- 02 - 005), commonly called the BARD.

A simulation approach to handle these situations is based on flow rate discretization (instead of mass dis-cretization) : the discrete simulation unfolds {{as a series of}} steady-state flows calculation updated when a state variable changes or a random event occurs.

This paper presents a novel technique based on maximizing flow through a network where nodes are black-box model units. This network-based method is less sensi-tive to problem size; the computation effort required to solve the mass balance is proportional to O(m+n) instead of O(mn) with linear programming.
