25|$|Before the book's publication, the Reagan {{administration}} {{claimed that}} unclassified source documents were released to Bamford in error, and threatened him with prosecution {{if he did}} not return 250 pages of documents he had obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The documents in question related to a 1975-76 Department of Justice investigation, and described the NSA's widespread illegal monitoring of domestic communication, warrantless surveillance <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> monitoring of commercial cable and telex traffic. Bamford's attorney, believing that they would prevail in court, invited the Department of Justice to prosecute, but no case was ever brought. In the wake of the dispute, classification rules were revised to allow document reclassification, and the contested documents were reclassified. NSA agents then visited libraries to remove other source documents from circulation.|$|E
25|$|Wilder wrote Our Town, {{a popular}} play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was {{inspired}} by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> many elements of Stein's modernist style {{can be found in}} the play. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set to underscore the human experience. Wilder played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
