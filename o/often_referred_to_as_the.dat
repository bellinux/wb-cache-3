50|$|Minisatellites {{and their}} shorter cousins, the microsatellites, {{together}} {{are classified as}} VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) DNA. Confusingly, minisatellites are <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> VNTRs, and microsatellites are <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> short tandem repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs).|$|R

The facilities of the dual-use King Alfred Sports Centre, which is next to the school site, are shared between the school and town.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's most {{immediate}} legacy was {{the introduction of}} Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At {{the time of his}} death, Alexander's empire covered some , and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300years. The successor states that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300years are <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic period.|$|E

5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's life after the trial is appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Vita, or Life.|$|E

5|$|The Apiary Laboratory, more <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Apiary, is a {{research}} laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built {{for the study of}} honey bees and apiculture, today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations. This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping.|$|E

5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the palace}} began in 1747 under Portuguese {{architect}} Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Despite being far smaller, the palace is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese Versailles. From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, {{it became the}} property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted one-third of the interior, the palace was extensively restored, and today {{is open to the public}} as a major tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes {{the existence of an}} unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated {{on the basis of its}} predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E

The regiment gained notoriety as the first unit in the Union army to suffer casualties in action during the Civil War in the Baltimore Riot and the first militia unit to arrive in Washington D.C. in response to President Abraham Lincoln's initial call for 75,000 troops. Private Luther C. Ladd of the 6th Massachusetts is <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first Union soldier killed in action during the war.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren was <b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> blue-and-white wren, {{and early}} observers, such as Norman Favaloro of Victoria, {{refer to them}} by this name. However, like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wren (family Troglodytidae). It was previously classified {{as a member of}} the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, and later {{as a member of the}} warbler family Sylviidae, before they were placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the subway}} system {{operates}} on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours {{some of the}} designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (<b>often</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 'shuttle train' version of its full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations must be maintained while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.|$|E
