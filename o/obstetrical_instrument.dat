5000|$|In 1747, French {{obstetrician}} Andre Levret, published [...] "Observations sur les causes et accidents de plusieurs accouchements laborieux" [...] (Observations on the Causes and Accidents of Several difficult Deliveries), {{in which}} he described his modification of the instrument to follow the curvature of the maternal pelvis, this [...] "pelvic curve" [...] allowing a grip on a fetal head still high in the pelvic excavation, which could assist in more difficult cases.This improvement was published in 1751 in England by William Smellie in the book [...] " [...] A Treatise on the {{theory and practice of}} midwifery." [...] After this fundamental improvement, the forceps would become a common <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instrument</b> for more than two centuries.The last improvement of the instrument was added in 1877 by a French obstetrician, Stephan Tarnier in [...] "descriptions of two new forceps." [...] This instrument featured a traction system misaligned with the instrument itself, sometimes called the [...] "third curvature of the forceps". This particularly ingenious traction system, allowed the forceps to exercise traction on the head of the child following the axis of the maternal pelvic excavation, which had never been possible before.Tarnier's idea was to [...] "split" [...] mechanically the grabbing of the fetal head (between the forceps blades) on which the operator does not intervene after their correct positioning, from a mechanical accessory set on the forceps itself, the [...] "tractor" [...] on which the operator exercises traction needed to pull down the fetal head in the correct axis of the pelvic excavation. Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the cesarean section.|$|E

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{development}} of <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instruments</b> The improvement of <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instruments</b> is greatly influenced by mechanical-technical possibilities. Particularly instruments such as levers and forceps, which are exposed to relatively high forces, should be made of hard and tough metals. For that reason the introduction of Sheffield-steel was very important. It offered the possibility to develop a great variety of forceps, including cranioclasts. In addition, for simple obstetric forceps one should also take into account the weight and the mechanical properties of the instrument. The latter depend on the length of the instrument and the position of the centre of rotation. Favourable terms - the least possible compression of the skull during traction - imply that the length of the handles is short in comparison with the length of the blades. Data concerning these factors are derived from the collection of the medical faculty at Leiden, comprising 117 obstetrical forceps. Indeed, 62 instruments belong to the favourable weight classes of 501 - 750 grams. The ratio in length between handles and blades shows a value of 0, 60 - 0, 80 in 36 instruments. From a mechanical point of view the Audibert forceps is very unfavourable, whereas two small-sized variants of the Naegele forceps have extremely low ratios and low weights...|$|R

Being born in safe conditions requires to be surrounded by professionals who acquire a rigorous knowledge of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Nowadays, midwives and obstetricians learn mainly in delivery ward during real childbirths. For difficult childbirths, the use of <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instruments</b> (forceps, spatulas or vacuum extractors) is unavoidable. However, the use of such instruments increases the risks of lesions for the mother and the fetus. In practical, only clinical experience acquired in the delivery ward enables these risks to be reduced. Nowadays, simulators in medicine have a real appeal in the medical environment. These tools enable doctors to visualize the position of the organs in the human body, to plan their movements or to carry out a more complete post operational control. A birth simulator provides a training tool and a research tool to compare various techniques for the use of <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instruments</b> or to validate new methods. It is in this context that we have developed, in collaboration with researchers and medical doctors, a new type of instrumented forceps to offer new solutions for training obstetricians for the safe use of obstetrical forceps delivery. The main contributions of this paper are the design of instrumented forceps coupled with the BirthSIM simulator and the path analysis during the forceps blades placement. This analysis leads to the comparison of the repeatability of the movement between novice obstetricians and expert obstetricians.

5000|$|Nihell {{started her}} midwife {{training}} in 1747 at the Hôtel Dieu in Paris {{for two years}} under Marie-Claude Pour. This was a long stay, however it was facilitated by the Duke of Orlèans {{which may have been}} the reason for the long stay. [...] There she was able to train and witness over 2,000 births. This was a big accomplishment because women in this time did not attend schooling, especially in the medical field. The Hôtel Dieu in Paris was common hospital around this time, which taught midwifery especially by one famous midwife, Madame du Coudray, who was supported by King Louis XV. In 1754, Nihell and her husband moved to Britain and settled in Haymarket. After settling in, Nihell started to advertise herself as a midwife in the London Evening Post. This allowed Nihell to attend over 900 births as a midwife. [...] In 1760, she published her first book called a Treatise on the Art of Midwifery, which was a criticism of William Smellie’s methods of childbirth and his use of forceps. Before the eighteenth century, male midwives in the birthing room were so rare there was little need for debate. [...] However, due to the creation and spread of forceps, male midwives became more popular and the status of female midwives declined due to the acceptance of male midwives by the upper class English and the belief that women were unable to understand and perform obstetric techniques. Nihell's publication spoke about how instruments brought into the birthing room by male midwives were usually unnecessary and caused harm to the baby. [...] Nihell also told readers that they had the right to any decisions in the birthing room, not the male midwives. Nihell's main concern was how these new <b>obstetrical</b> <b>instruments</b> would replace female midwives at a much greater cost to infant’s lives. Nihell believed that for an easy delivery, assistance from a midwife was all that was needed and for extreme situations all that was required was knowledge, experience, tenderness, and presence of mind. She even stated that male midwives would get paid more than female midwives. After publishing her work there were many people who criticized her. However, Nihell fought back with anonymous publications, letters to the press, and a treatise titled The Danger and Immodesty of the Present too General Customs of Unnecessarily Employing Men-Midwives (1772). She even called one critic a buffoon, which was unheard of as women in this time period were not supposed to be outspoken.|$|R
