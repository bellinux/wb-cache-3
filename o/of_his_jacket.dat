25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
25|$|The post-shooting {{investigation}} found no weapons on Diallo's body; the item {{he had pulled}} out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> was not a gun, but a rectangular black wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled the officers had acted within policy, based on what a reasonable police officer would {{have done in the}} same circumstances with the information they had. The Diallo shooting led to a review of police training policy and the use of full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets. On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. All four officers' bail were set at $100,000. On December 16, an appellate court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York, stating that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial in New York City impossible. On February 25, 2000, after two days of deliberation, a jury in Albany acquitted the officers of all charges. Officer Kenneth Boss had been previously involved in an incident where an unarmed man was shot. Another black man, 22-year-old Patrick Bailey, died after Boss shot him on October 31, 1997. As of 2012, Boss is the only remaining officer working for the NYPD. After his acquittal, Boss was disarmed and reassigned to desk duty. In October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss' ability to carry a firearm against the protests of Diallo's family. On December 17, 2015, Kenneth Boss, received a promotion to the rank of sergeant despite objections from the victim’s mother and civil rights activists. Boss was promoted in accordance to police policy, which is not subject to review by top department officials.|$|E

500|$|He {{was walking}} down a quiet {{suburban}} street {{on his way home}} after his usual evening teaching session. He noticed three youths hovering several yards away {{on the opposite side of}} the street. When they approached him he was ready. [...] "Give us your money, or you'll get hurt" [...] said the leader of the three. Abbe looked at each one in turn, then casually took his wallet out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket, throwing it on the floor between himself and the antagonists. He pointed to the wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?" [...] The three would-be attackers looked at the wallet on the floor, then at Abbe and then at each other and then moved away. Abbe picked up his wallet and calmly walked home.|$|E
500|$|A three-page {{letter was}} found in the pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier, and {{published}} in the newspaper La Presse. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted an attack on the Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees. The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism. [...] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.|$|E
500|$|Bertin is {{presented}} as strong, energetic and warm-hearted. His hair is grey verging on white, his fingers spread across his knees. Bertin's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as [...] "crab-like claws... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are {{the sleeves of his}} coat." [...] The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket, black trousers and brown satin waistcoat, with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck. He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his [...] "nearly ferocious presence" [...] is accentuated by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, stubby fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar.|$|E

500|$|Born February 1860 in Nagano, Sanosuke is {{a former}} member of the Sekihō Army. Having admired his captain Sagara Sōzō, he takes the family name Sagara from him. But when the revolutionary {{government}} encounters financial problems, it labels the Sekihō Army as frauds in order to [...] "bury their promises". Sōzō is executed, leaving Sanosuke as one of the few survivors. Consumed with hatred for the Ishin Shishi, and guilt at not being able to protect his hero, Sanosuke becomes a fight merchant in Tokyo. Over the next ten years, he gains a reputation as one of the strongest hired fighters of the city. The destruction of the Sekihō Army and the loss of all his friends has caused Sanosuke to hate the Meiji Government and he wears the Japanese kanji for [...] "evil" [...] on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> He bears this symbol as a mark of his loyalty towards his past in the Sekihō Army. Sanosuke uses an enormous zanbatō in battle, giving him the moniker [...] The blade has no edge and Sanosuke only uses it to smash and crush his opponents.|$|E
500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|At Stonehenge, the Doctor, Amy, and River find {{a passage}} to an {{underground}} area. Inside, {{they find the}} Pandorica, a giant metal box outfitted with every type of lock imaginable. While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found in the pocket <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and feels a strong emotional attachment to; he says that it belonged to a [...] "friend", and that nothing is ever truly forgotten. The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe during the events of [...] "Cold Blood" [...] and erased from existence. When Amy comes around after being knocked out by a damaged Cyberman, she does not remember Rory, which upsets him greatly. The Doctor assures Rory that Amy will remember in time, and hands him the engagement ring.|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E

5000|$|On March 19, 2003, Espinosa {{was arrested}} during the Black Spring after {{security}} agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa {{was accused of}} [...] "activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>jackets.</b> Espinosa was subsequently {{convicted and sentenced to}} 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried.|$|R

5000|$|The Wheaton Bandit is an {{unidentified}} bank robber suspected {{to be responsible}} for as many as 16 armed robberies around Wheaton, Illinois in western suburban Chicago from 2002 to 2006.
