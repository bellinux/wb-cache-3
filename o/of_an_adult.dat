5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
5|$|The body <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> {{butterfly}} or moth (imago) {{has three}} distinct divisions, called tagmata, connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing {{on both the}} left and the right side of the thorax and, like all insects, have three pairs of legs.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that by 4 months of age infants use the eye gaze of adults to guide their attention and facilitate processing of environmental information. Here we {{address the question of}} how infants process the relation between another person and an external object. We applied an ERP paradigm to investigate the neural processes underlying the perception of the direction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult's</b> eye gaze in 4 -month-old infants. Infants showed differential processing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult's</b> eye gaze, which was directed at a simultaneously presented object compared to non-object-directed eye gaze. This distinction was evident in two ERP components: The Negative component, reflecting attentional processes, and the positive slow wave, which is involved in memory encoding. The implications of these findings for the development of joint attention and related social cognitive functions are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth the size <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State {{joined with}} a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed {{in a lawsuit}} against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable {{restrictions}} upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social {{group is the}} family, {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which {{can be made up}} of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The first {{published}} {{depictions of the}} shell of this species appeared in 1681 in the earliest book solely about sea shells, Recreatio mentis et oculi in observatione animalium testaceorum (Refreshment {{of the mind and}} the eye in the observation of shell-bearing animals) by Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni. The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the care}} for a young bat comes from the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is not hers, occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides with the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
