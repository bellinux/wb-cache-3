25|$|One {{biography}} describes him {{as having}} nice features including a good complexion, {{and a strong}} distinct voice. He also had an excellent volubility of language, an elegant ease of speech, and a good memory. He was generally <b>open</b> <b>minded,</b> had a great wit, and spoke with authority. Charles claims he was a direct descendant of Jacques de L'Orme, {{one of those who}} worked on the reform of the Custom of Bourbonnais.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were <b>open</b> <b>minded,</b> tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s and 1990s Beth Elohim's {{buildings}} were repaired and refurbished {{a number of}} times. The sanctuary ceiling cracked in the early 1980s, and services were held in Temple House for a time. The congregation mounted a [...] "Save our Sanctuary" [...] campaign in 1982, and repaired the ceiling. In the 1980s Beth Elohim also refurbished the Moses stained glass window, and painted the main sanctuary. The congregation restored and renovated its buildings in 1990, and in 1992 did emergency restoration work to the facade of Temple House and restored the pews. In 1997 the synagogue began its [...] "Kadimah Capital Campaign", which was intended to raise funds to repair and renovate the buildings. By 1999, the congregation had restored Temple House's facade, rebuilt the collapsed Garfield St. entrance, made entry into the synagogue handicapped accessible, added a multipurpose space and classrooms {{in the basement of}} the sanctuary, and planned to add a fifth floor for more classrooms. That year Sack (by then Rabbi Emeritus) died; the year before his death his son, Robert, at his induction as a Second Circuit judge, had described his father as [...] "the most <b>open</b> <b>minded</b> man he had ever known".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} column, Sheldrake again {{attacked}} Rose for following [...] "materialism", {{and argued that}} quantum physics had [...] "overturned" [...] materialism, and suggested that [...] "memories {{may turn out to}} depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces". [...] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's [...] "latest muddled diatribe", defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an [...] "absurd rhetorical comparison", asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism and argued that [...] "being roughly right about great many things has given [...] the confidence to be far more <b>open</b> <b>minded</b> than he is prepared to give them credit for".|$|E
2500|$|Green had a Jewish {{heritage}} and {{was raised in}} Christian Science. He grew up reading the New Testament and called the mixture of being Jewish and learning about Jesus [...] "an odd combination" [...] that left him <b>open</b> <b>minded</b> but deeply unsatisfied. He began doing drugs and became interested in eastern mysticism and [...] "free love." [...] After experiencing what Green described as a [...] "bad trip," [...] he abandoned drug use and became interested in philosophy and theology. [...] "When Green was 19 he met a fellow seeker/musician named Melody. They were inseparable and got married a year later – now he had a partner as his spiritual and musical quest continued." [...] Green later stated, however, that {{in the midst of}} his skepticism, he had, [...] "been lost in a fantasy, till [...] love broke through." [...] and he renounced Christian Science and became a Jewish believer in Jesus the Messiah. A week later, Green's wife Melody, whom he had married in 1973 and was also Jewish, became a Jewish believer in Jesus. It was during this time that the newlyweds became involved with the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Southern California.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study on}} {{personality}} and religiosity found {{that members of}} secular organizations (like the international Center for Inquiry) have similar personality profiles to members of religious groups. This study found that members of secular organizations are very likely to label themselves primarily as [...] "atheists", but also very likely to consider themselves humanists. It was also found that secular group members show {{no significant differences in}} their negative or positive affect. The surveyed individuals also had similar profiles for conscientiousness (discipline or impulse control, and acting on values like [...] "pursuit of truth"). Secular group members tended to be less agreeable (e.g. more likely to hold unpopular, socially challenging views), as well as more <b>open</b> <b>minded</b> (e.g. more likely to consider new ideas) than members of religious groups. Luke Galen, a personality researcher, writes [...] "Many previously reported characteristics associated with religiosity are a function not of belief itself, but of strong convictions and group identification." [...] Catherine Caldwell-Harris notes that [...] "non-believers" [...] are interested in social justice concerns and posits that this is due to their lack of belief in an afterlife, leading to a focus on what can be fixed here and now. [...] Another study by Caldwell-Harris describes atheists as being capable of experiencing awe, which she states debunks stereotypes of atheists as [...] "cynical and joyless". [...] A 2014 study created six different personality profiles of 'types' of nonbelievers and compared them to Big Five personality traits.|$|E
2500|$|NFC {{has been}} found to be {{strongly}} associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas. Epistemic curiosity can be defined as ‘‘desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems". Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a [...] "personality construct that represents an individual’s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing". Openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with [...] "aspects of being <b>open</b> <b>minded,</b> engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself". Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and [...] typical intellectual engagement (r = [...]78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct. Further studies have found that NFC, [...] typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. Factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis. The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others. A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits. For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than NFC.|$|E
