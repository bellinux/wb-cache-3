500|$|ILM filmed starships using {{motion control}} for timed and {{computer-assisted}} model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because {{different parts of}} the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The Excelsior required eight passes to supplement the main [...] "beauty pass", the Enterprise six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; [...] "If anything got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch,</b> or somehow we dropped a frame, we would have to reshoot—and then you're stuck. You've ruined two pieces, two elements," [...] Farrar said.|$|E
500|$|Like Jaco Van Dormael's {{previous}} films, {{the score}} for Mr. Nobody {{was written by}} Pierre Van Dormael. He worked on simple themes and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> loops, [...] "a mixture of superficial simplicity and underlying complexity." [...] He wrote themes that overlapped to form new ones, each theme continuing to exist while being mixed with the others. The director {{did not want the}} music to be overtly emotional, so he and Pierre chose a minimalist orchestration, more often than not just a single guitar. Jaco said, [...] "We wanted the instrument and the player to be felt. This stance actually sums up the whole adventure: a maximalist project with a minimalist approach." [...] Mr. Nobody is the last film of composer Pierre Van Dormael before his death in 2008. His music won the Magritte Award for Best Original Score in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The show grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> lip <b>synching</b> {{contests}} {{developed by}} Wm.

The planning process eventually grew into Puttin' on the Hits with Chris Bearde and Dick Clark serving as executive producers. Clark's son, Richard A. Clark, produced with Wood serving as the consulting producer. MCA Television served as distributor. Puttin' on the Hits was taped in Hollywood, California at Universal City Studios.|$|R

5000|$|This {{community}} spirit helped persuade CalPERS to {{hold onto}} its Mountain House investment, despite the drawbacks of a 1994-vintage land plan, termed [...] "out <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> {{with the realities of}} the post-housing crash world." [...] Helping to balance the challenges of the land plan was the level of established infrastructure and homebuyers motivated by affordable pricing, proximity to job centers and traditional neighborhoods.|$|R
500|$|Snoop Dogg {{also helped}} them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid $30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard {{recorded}} his track {{in a matter}} of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about [...] "bitches." [...] It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, using Pro Tools because his raps were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> with Clark's beat. The duo eventually had to re-record their lines and re-title the song [...] "Bitches". Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted Ice-T. However, he charged them only $10,000. The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on the compilation, Psychopathics from Outer Space (2000). The song [...] "Echo Side" [...] was originally released at an Insane Clown Posse concert in Garden City, Michigan as the first ever single from Dark Lotus.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} tenet of attachment {{theory is that}} an infant needs to develop a relationship {{with at least one}} primary caregiver for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to effectively regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is equally likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction. In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a [...] "safe base" [...] from which to explore. It should be recognized that [...] "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch,</b> or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers in 1993 were satisfied, if {{somewhat}} bemused, {{by the first}} episode of the then 25-year-old series. In a preview published on 1 October, {{the date of the}} episode's première network broadcast on BBC Two, James Rampton of The Independent wrote: [...] "The best thing about the programme is that it's just as ludicrous as you remembered: the lips bizarrely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> with the words, the strange uniformity of features (isn't that security guard Alan from Thunderbirds?), and the totally preposterous dialogue ('Despite his fatal injuries, he's returning to life'). Highly recommended." [...] In her review dated 3 October, and printed in the same newspaper, Allison Pearson was comically critical of certain design aspects, such as the surface of Mars, the exterior of the Mysteron city and the London Car-Vu model (described as a [...] "Philippe Starck cake-stand").

50|$|Adrienne went to London {{where she}} {{successfully}} embezzled millions from the London {{branch of the}} Hellfire Club. She then began to plot her revenge on Emma by returning to the school, demanding that she be reinstated as headmistress or she would expose the school as a mutant sanctuary. She revealed the school's mutant students regardless, starting riots among human students, and later planted bombs at the school aimed at killing a maximum number of students - a plot that was only foiled by the sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>Synch,</b> who died containing the blasts.|$|R
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} convinced, with Australia's PALGN {{referring}} to the story as [...] "rather predictable and clichéd". Jonathan Parkyn of Personal Computer World wrote, [...] "Dialogue is NWN2's key component.... but those who favour fisticuffs may find it tiresome after playing for several billion hours." [...] Similarly, reception of Neverwinter Nights 2's graphics was mixed. Some reviewers referred to the visuals as [...] "new age" [...] and [...] "beautiful", but others noticed inconsistencies in their rendering and performance, especially on lower-end PCs. The Sydney Morning Herald said [...] "The detailed 3D engine allows for lush scenery, giving you {{a greater sense of}} exploration as you poke around the rustic villages and murky swamps". [...] Several comments on the audio and voice acting were positive, though one reviewer expressed disappointment that some sound effects had apparently been recycled from Neverwinter Nights. [...] Conklin called the in-game camera [...] "abysmal" [...] and said the game had many graphical glitches. [...] Slagle agreed, writing, [...] "I had a lot of stuttering graphics and voiceovers that were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> with the characters' on-screen animations." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{movie of}} the game was {{produced}} before the corresponding track [...] "Dark Dawn" [...] was, and Mitsuda had to rearrange his composition after realizing some parts were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> with the frames by about {{a minute and a}} half. The choral track, titled [...] "The Beginning and the End", was performed by a 41-voice choir named The Great Voices of Bulgaria and features lyrics written by Tetsuya Takahashi. His lyrics were translated from Japanese to English then to Bulgarian for the recording. Joanne Hogg sang in English on [...] "Stars of Tears" [...] and [...] "Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~". The latter took Mitsuda [...] "an awfully long amount of time" [...] just to compose the demo version. Masato Kato wrote the original lyrics for the two songs, and Hogg arranged them so that they would fit the melodies better and sound more Celtic. As with most of his previous soundtracks, Mitsuda composed a musical box arrangement of one of the main themes; in Xenogears case, the track [...] "Distant Promise" [...] is the musical box version of [...] "Small Two of Pieces".|$|E

5000|$|In the UK and elsewhere, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the US, there is apparently no legal prohibition to the combination of audio and visual images and no explicit statutory right for the collection <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> royalties. In the US, however, the Copyright Act defines the audiovisual format as that of combining images with music for use in machines and there is no explicit rate set such as the [...] "compulsory royalty rate" [...] for copying music. However there are instances of courts implying the synchronization right, but even so, it is an amorphous colloquial commercial term of acceptance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>synching</b> also {{occurs in}} musical theater, for {{much the same}} purpose as for musicians. A production may include a mix of lip-synched and live musical numbers. In long-running shows, this may be done to help protect the performer's voice from strain and damage, {{as well as to}} maintain a high caliber of production. A notable example of using lip-synching as a special effect includes performances of The Phantom of the Opera, with swing actors in the same costumes as the lead actors give the illusion of the characters moving around the stage with some mystery.|$|R
5000|$|On the series, Glick {{is joined}} by long-suffering, heavily made-up {{announcer}} and band leader, Adrian Van Voorhees (Michael McKean), who also resembles Lawrence Welk from the Lawrence Welk Show. Adrian plays a full classical harp, leading a band of scraggly-looking immigrants (they do a very poor job <b>of</b> <b>synching</b> up their [...] "performance" [...] with the music that is playing). While Adrian generally attempts to conduct himself in a professional manner, he occasionally loses his patience with Jiminy's idiocy and constant, usually unintentional put-downs. He can sometimes be heard muttering disgustedly about Jiminy ("You are fat...sloppy fat") but Jiminy remains blissfully unaware of Adrian's hostility.|$|R
2500|$|The Islamic calendar, however, {{is based}} on a {{different}} set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates. Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually in no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries. [...] Still, {{due to the fact that}} both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> with one another.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the needs}} of NASA's Voyager 2 mission, {{in this paper we}} {{describe}} an algorithm which detects and corrects losses of node synchronization in convolutionally encoded data. This algorithm, which would be implemented as a hardware device external to a Viterbi decoder, makes statistical decisions about node synch based on the hard-quantized undecoded data stream. We will show that in a worst-case Voyager environment, our method will detect and correct a true loss <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> (thought to be a very rare event) within several hundred bits; many of the resulting outages will be corrected by the outer Reed-Solomon code. At the same time, the mean time between false alarms is on the order of several years, independent of the signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

50|$|In early cinema history, {{there was}} no {{standard}} frame rate established. Edison's early films were shot at 40 fps, while the Lumière Brothers used 16 fps.

After the introduction <b>of</b> <b>synch</b> sound recording, 24 fps became the industry standard frame rate for capture and projection of motion pictures. 24 fps was chosen because it was the minimum frame rate that would produce adequate sound quality. This was done because film was expensive, and using the lowest possible frame rate would use the least amount of film.|$|R

Our study shows that when the synch errors are much smaller than a symbol interval, the performance of parallel relays deteriorates gracefully.
