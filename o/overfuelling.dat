50|$|Another small {{disadvantage}} is as {{the engine}} wears, the mean vacuum is decreased. This 'fools' the MAP sensor into <b>overfuelling.</b> This {{is only a}} problem on very high mileage engines.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} no {{downstream}} turbine, a ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel:air ratios, which implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature {{of the order of}} 2400 K for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, for a range of flight speeds/altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high yaw/pitch during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of flame holders, which vary in design from combustor cans to simple flat plates, to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing. <b>Overfuelling</b> the combustor can cause the normal shock within a supersonic intake system to be pushed forward beyond the intake lip, resulting in a substantial drop in engine airflow and net thrust.|$|E
5000|$|During a Slam Acceleration on {{a single}} spool turbojet, the working line of the {{compressor}} tends to deviate from the steady state working line and adopt a curved path, initially going towards surge, but slowly returning to the steady state line, as the fuel flow reaches a new higher steady state value. During the initial <b>overfuelling,</b> the inertia of the spool tends to prevent the shaft speed from accelerating rapidly. Naturally, the extra fuel flow increases the turbine rotor entry temperature, '''''' [...] Since the turbine operates between two choked planes (i.e. the turbine and nozzle throats), the turbine pressure ratio and the corresponding temperature drop/entry temperature, '''''', remain approximately constant. Since '''''' increases, so must the temperature drop across the turbine and the turbine power output. This extra turbine power, increases the temperature rise across the compressor and, therefore, the compressor pressure ratio. Since the corrected speed of the compressor has hardly changed, the working point tends to move upwards, along a line of roughly constant corrected speed. As time progresses the shaft begins to accelerate and the effect just described diminishes.|$|E
40|$|The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is a proof-of-principle scale device {{whose mission}} is to {{establish}} the physics basis of low aspect configurations most notably {{in the areas of}} plasma stability, transport and non-inductive current drive. The first series of physics experiments was conducted during the period from Sept. 1999 through Jan. 2000. Among the first experiments was a study to map out and characterize the operational density and q-limits. Density limits have typically been associated with enhanced radiated power due to <b>overfuelling</b> or impurity influx, although ion neoclassical transport may impose a density limit at very high densities in ohmic, gas-fueled plasmas. q-limits have typically been manifestations of destabilization of m= 2 /n= 1 kink or tearing modes that lead to a sudden discharge termination...|$|E
