40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} viewed as a key bank funding, risk {{management}} and performance improvement tool {{over the last two}} decades. However, the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 has shown that engagement in securitisation might create significant financial problems for banks and consequently lead to widespread problems in the financial sector. This, therefore, has underlined the importance of understanding banks’ securitisation activities, the benefits and risks inherent, and the consequences for the financial system. This thesis comprises empirical research on the effects of securitisation on banks. The work is presented in three essays. The first essay investigates whether banks improve their performance through the use of the securitisation market by applying a propensity score matching approach. Specifically, we attempt to assess whether the access to the securitisation market led to lower cost of funding, less credit risk exposure, and higher profitability. Using US commercial bank data from 2001 to 2008, we first test these hypotheses using univariate analysis and find that securitising banks are, on average, more profitable institutions, with higher credit risk exposure, and higher cost of funding. However, the propensity score matching analysis does not provide evidence to suggest that securitisation had a significant impact upon bank performance. In other words, the analysis shows that securitisers would have had comparable cost of funding, credit risk, and profitability had they remained non-securitising. This evidence leads us to conclude that securitisation does not seem to outperform alternative funding, risk management, and profitability improvement techniques used by non-securitising banks that have ex-ante similar characteristics to those securitising. The second essay investigates the impact of securitisation on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks. Using US bank holding company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding <b>securitised</b> <b>assets</b> choose asset portfolios of lower credit risk. Examining securitisations by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding securitisation and risk taking is primarily driven by securitisations of mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer loans. Securitisations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit-risk taking behaviour. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in securitisation transactions, as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitisation on the riskiness of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the structure of transactions. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude of credit support provided by banks. The third essay examines the relationship between banks’ off-balance sheet securitisation structures and insolvency risk, with a particular focus on credit and liquidity support provided by these banks. Additionally, it examines the risk effect of credit-enhancing facilities and liquidity commitments provided by banks to securitisation structures of other institutions. Using US bank holding company data for the period from 2002 to 2007, we first find that credit enhancements provided by originating banks in their securitisation structures have a significant positive effect on insolvency risk of the banks. Second, examining credit enhancements by the form of underlying facility, we find that among credit-enhancing interest-only strips, subordinated securities, and standby letters of credit, the latter have the greatest positive association with bank insolvency risk. In contrast, liquidity provisions are found to have a significant risk-reducing effect. Finally, examining credit and liquidity support provided by banks to third-party securitisation structures, we find that credit enhancing third-party securitisations reduces insolvency risk of the banks, while liquidity provisions are found to be highly positively associated with their insolvency. Summarising the main findings, the first essay finds no evidence of significant causal effects of securitisation on performance of securitising banks. The second essay finds evidence to suggest that outstanding securitisation has a negative impact on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks; while the third essay finds that the interests retained by banks in connection to <b>securitised</b> <b>assets</b> significantly increase their insolvency risk. This shows that the net risk transfer for originating banks through securitisation might be ambiguous; however banks do account for the retained exposure to the <b>securitised</b> <b>assets</b> reducing credit risk taking. Taken together, the evidence from the three studies suggests that banks predominantly use securitisation for financing purposes rather than as a risk management or performance improvement mechanism. This research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} motives for and consequent implications of securitisation and provides valuable findings for the ongoing discussion of how to redesign the securitisation model and to reform the supervision and regulation of banks’ engagement in securitisation activities in response to the recent financial crisis.

Despite the recent {{rapid growth of}} securitisation, the Latin American market remains in its infancy, {{as reflected in the}} size and type of assets involved in transactions. Because of its benefits, further encouragement should be given to promoting this financing technique in the region. However, careful attention should also be paid to the associated risks. JEL classification: G 150, G 180, G 210, O 160. Securitisation in Latin America has expanded rapidly in the last five years. However, the small average size of issues and their lack of secondary market liquidity suggest that the market for <b>securitised</b> <b>assets</b> remains in its infancy. Furthermore, there has been a high degree of heterogeneity in this regional development. Just two countries, Brazil and Mexico, accounted for three quarters of all domestic securitised issues launched in 2006. Although this partly reflects differences {{in the size of the}} economies and in the degree of development of regional financial systems, it may also be indicative of the relative novelty of the legal frameworks governing securitisation in some countries. Structured finance can have a positive influence on the financial system because it {{can transform}} ordinarily illiquid or risky assets into more liquid or less risky ones. It thus offers an alternative source of long-term funding in both domestic and cross-border markets, and can foster the development of domestic bond markets. In turn, this could promote greater bank and financial market efficiency, as it implies greater competition to meet customer financing needs. The securitisation process in Latin America has already contributed to enhancing the liquidity of domestic residential mortgages and consumer loans. This is similar to the experience in other regions of the world, such as Asia. However, the process has differed in various respects.

40|$|Through a {{focus on}} the ever {{increasing}} need to address information asymmetries, as well as reference to the uniqueness {{of the degree to which}} systemic risks are triggered in banking, this paper aims primarily to highlight reasons why government and central bank intervention are essential and required in financial regulation. The role presently assumed by regulation is not the same as it was thirty years ago. Deregulation and conglomeration have significantly altered the landscape in which regulation previously existed and to an extent, defined the role which it presently assumes. For this reason, arguments which were (and have been) directed against government, central bank intervention, as well as the role of regulation, require re-evaluation. Deposit insurance and lender of last resort arrangements serve to instil confidence in depositors hence contributing towards safeguarding system stability and preventing unnecessary runs where panics occur. Such benefits are not only considered against those arguments advanced by antagonists of deposit insurance and lender of last resort arrangements, but also against those views which do not favour government and central bank intervention. In evaluating whether free banking is equipped with as many mechanisms and safeguards required in safeguarding the stability of the financial system, the urgency for such safety net instruments, which is attributed to the peculiar and unique nature of banking, will be considered. Contrary to the argument [that “if markets are generally better at allocating resources than governments are, then the differences or distinctions which exist between “money” and the industry that provides it (the banking industry) should not serve as bases for an assumption that money and banking are exceptions to the general rule”], it has to be highlighted (for several reasons) that the banking industry could not be equated to other areas of the financial sector. One of such reasons relates to the extent to which the impact of systemic runs differ within the banking sector when compared to other areas such as the securities markets. The differences in the nature of risks which exist in banking and those which exist within the securities markets, constitutes another reason why the need for government and central bank intervention is advocated. Furthermore, even though the nature of banking risks warrants government and central bank intervention – as well as capital adequacy regulation, capital regulation should also be extended to the securities markets for many reasons – one of which is the ability to <b>securitise</b> <b>assets.</b> If there was no longer a role for regulation, then re- regulation should not have occurred in certain jurisdictions which have adopted and successfully implemented consolidated supervision. ...|$|R
40|$|Asset {{securitisation}} {{represents an}} alternative risk management and refinancing method, which allows issues to convert classifiable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of pre-existing assets and receivables (liquidity transformation and asset diversification process) of varying maturity and quality (integration and differentiation process) into negotiable capital market paper, so-called "asset-backed securities" (ABS). Over {{the recent past}} ambivalence {{in the definition of}} capital adequacy for credit risk has particularly facilitated the development of loan securitisation as a refined "regulatory arbitrage tool". However, as impending regulatory change shifts the prime objective of securitisation to the efficient management of economic capital, procedural and substantive aspects of asset securitisation warrant closer inspection. The dissertation presents a comprehensive examination of the risk modelling, asset selection, optimal security design and competitive market pricing of asset-backed securities. We first provide an overview of the main characteristics of asset securitisation and explain its attendant benefits and drawbacks, especially as they pertain to the refinancing of illiquid asset exposures, such as SME-related payment obligations. Subsequently, we explain the gradual evolution of the regulatory treatment of asset securitisation adopted by the Basle Committee on banking Supervision {{in the wake of a}} general revision of the 1988 Basle Accord, which finally led to the adoption of the so-called Basle Securitisation Framework in 2004. We then present a single-factor, loss-based asset pricing model, which estimates the risk-neutral investment return of subordinated debt securities ("tranches") as leveraged contingent claims on a securitised reference portfolio of pooled credit exposures. We challenge common wisdom of robust statistics for the estimation of portfolio credit risk by adopting extreme value analysis, mainly because the leveraged exposure of securitised debt on fundamental asset value changes requires a better parametric specification of extreme quantiles to gauge unexpected loss. Based on the loss sharing between issuers and investors in a common security design, we examine how <b>securitised</b> <b>asset</b> exposure translates into investment risk of asset-backed securities. As a longitudinal extension to this valuation model, we also investigate the price dynamics of securitised debt. A multi-factor GARCH process is applied as an econometric specification of the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of selected types of ABS transactions for valuation and forecasting purposes. In light of the substantial valuation uncertainty in securitisation markets, we conclude with a simple one-shot auction model, in which issuers maximise net payoffs from securitised debt under "winner's curse"-type underpricing as agency cost of adverse selection. In particular, we study how uninformed investment demand at varying degrees of valuation uncertainty affects the utility of endogenous price discovery by informed investors. Overall our synthesis of empirical and theoretical approaches yields instructive findings about important yet unexplored issues concerning the economic rationale of asset securitisation...|$|R

This research paper examines the property asset allocation strategies for the A$ 1. 7 trillion Australian managed funds industry and identifies the important steps and considerations that influence their optimal property allocation view and decision making process. Based on in-depth semi-structured survey, the research identifies and documents the factors that aid property asset allocation decisions for Australian fund managers. It investigates the use and relevancy of Strategic Asset Allocation, Dynamic Strategic Asset Allocation and Tactical Asset Allocation strategies for property asset allocation decisions. The results indicate that the allocation of resources to property assets is a complex system of interdependent decisions given its distinctive investment characteristics when compared to alternative asset classes. Apart from definitive/ quantitative inputs in property asset allocation models, Australian fund managers are influenced by many other non-financial considerations. In addition, there are notable differences in techniques for direct property, unlisted property and <b>securitised</b> property <b>asset</b> allocation.

40|$|The {{future of}} securitisation: how to align incentives? 1 This article reviews the recent {{collapse}} of global securitisation {{markets and the}} loss of investor confidence in them. It then sets out measures that could be taken to revive and strengthen the securitisation process, including mechanisms based on retention requirements for originators. It ends with a number of simple implications for policymakers and market practitioners. JEL classification: G 100, G 200. Large losses in the value of mortgage-related products and an associated deterioration in investor appetite led to broad-based distress in securitisation markets from the summer of 2007. Problems started with subprime mortgagerelated instruments, which experienced severe credit quality deterioration as a long period of appreciating house prices in the United States came to a halt. Losses were magnified by increasingly illiquid markets, and worsened further during the broad investor retreat from risk triggered by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and subsequent signs of global recession. 2 As a result, spreads on securitised products soared (Graph 1, left-hand panel) and activity across most market segments came to a sudden stop. Issuance volumes, which had risen to a combined annual total for the United States and Europe of about $ 3. 8 trillion over the 2005 – 07 period, collapsed to just over $ 2 trillion in 2008. Reflecting a generalised loss of investor confidence, most of this remaining issuance was in the US agency sector (ie securities underwritten by US government-sponsored mortgage financing enterprises) and in European securitisations used for refinancing activities with the ECB. The US subprime and Alt-A market, which had peaked at some $ 815 billion in 2006, vanished, as did markets for many <b>other</b> <b>securitised</b> instruments (Graph 1, right-hand panel). 1 The views expressed in this article {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS or the National Bank of Belgium.

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of banks in {{cross-border}} finance has become an urgent priority. Cross-border banks have {{played a central role}} in the dynamics of the global crisis of 2007 - 2009. First, European banks had a surprisingly large exposure to the US <b>securitised</b> <b>asset</b> markets, which arose to a significant extent through global banks acting either on the buying or selling side in these markets. Second, the breakdown in credit and asset markets was an international phenomenon, with cross-border linkages suffering disproportionately due to greater information problems vis-à-vis cross-border counterparties and the differences in regulatory regimes. Third, currency mismatches in funding became evident, with European banks suffering a dollar shortage that ultimately required resolution through a major currency swap initiative among the main central banks. Fourth, the provision of fiscal support for distressed banks was especially problematic in relation to cross-border activities. The rescue of multi-country banks, such as Dexia and Fortis, required the governments involved to devise ad hoc, ex-post burden-sharing agreements. In relation to emerging Europe, there were also fears that the policies of home-country governments might encourage parent banks to fail to support the operations of affiliates. This report analyses key aspects of cross-border banking, takes a European focus and derives policy recommendations based on them. Chapter 1 of the report first documents the evolution of cross-border banking in Europe in the two decades prior to the crisis. We then turn to the role cross-border banking played during the crisis of 2007 - 2009, with a key focus on whether crossborder activities have exacerbated the crisis or helped to mitigate it. We also analyse the regulatory response to cross-border problems in the crisis.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{theoretical}} models to study bank risk-taking and financial stability. Three issues are explored: (1) the moral-hazard incentive for securitisation, (2) the socially optimal banking {{structure for the}} economy, and (3) the relationship between bank competition and financial stability, based on bank funding structures and fire-sale risks. Chapter 2 proposes a model to study how bank securitisation affects the value of bank equity, and hence what leads a bank to <b>securitise</b> its <b>assets.</b> The proposed model shows that moral hazard (which is induced by the deposit insurance scheme), can be one essential motive for the securitisation of deposit-taking commercial banks. This chapter also discusses some factors that can restrain the moral-hazard and risk-taking behaviour in bank securitisation. Chapter 3 investigates the social value of different banking structures. The proposed model finds that total separation is not the optimal banking structure for an economy, because it forbids the liquidity transfer between subsidiary banks, which is socially valuable. The comparison between ring-fencing and universal banking is more complicated; Chapter 3 shows that whether ring-fencing or universal banking is the best banking structure for an economy depends on the returns to the different subsidiary banking sectors. Chapter 4 studies how asset fire-sales risks and bank funding structures can affect the relationship between bank competition and financial stability. The proposed model finds that the funding-structure risks of the banks can create an incentive for excess risk-taking in a multi-bank economy. Moreover, the model shows that the excessive risk taking increases {{with the number of}} banks in the economy. This result is similar in spirit to the Cournot equilibrium in standard microeconomic theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Predictions obtained from the VAR and other univariate time-series models are compared with the predictions of an artificial neural network model.
