25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E

5000|$|Thermophotonics (often {{abbreviated}} as TPX) is {{a concept}} for generating usable power from heat which shares some features of thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power generation. A TPX system consists of a light-emitting diode (LED) (though other types of emitters are conceivable), a photovoltaic (PV) cell, an <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> between the two, and an electronic control circuit. The LED is heated to a temperature higher than the PV temperature by an external heat source. If no power {{is applied to the}} LED, the system functions much like a very inefficient TPV system, but if a forward bias is applied at some fraction of the bandgap potential, an increased number of electron-hole pairs (EHPs) will be thermally excited to the bandgap energy. These EHPs can then recombine radiatively so that the LED emits light at a rate higher than the thermal radiation rate ("superthermal" [...] emission). This light is then delivered to the cooler PV cell over the <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> and converted to electricity.|$|E
50|$|Critical to {{understanding}} how an optical ring resonator works, {{is the concept}} of how the linear waveguides are coupled to the ring waveguide. When a beam of light passes through a wave guide as shown in the graph on the right, part of light will be coupled into the optical ring resonator. The reason for this phenomenon to happen is because the wave property of the light, or if we consider it in ray optics, it is because of the transmission effect. In other words, if the ring and the waveguide are close enough, the light in the waveguide will be transmitted into the ring. There are three aspects that affect the optical coupling: the distance, the coupling length and the refractive indices between the waveguide and the optical ring resonator. In order to optimize the coupling, it is usually the case to narrow the distance between the ring resonator and the waveguide. The closer the distance, the easier the <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> happens. In addition, the coupling length affects the coupling as well. The coupling length represents the effective curve length of the ring resonator for the coupling phenomenon to happen with the waveguide. It has been studied that as the <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> length increases, the difficulty for the coupling to happen decreases. Furthermore, the refractive index of the waveguide material, the ring resonator material and the medium material in between the waveguide and the ring resonator also affect the <b>optical</b> <b>coupling.</b> The medium material is usually the important one been studied since it has a great effect on the transmission of the light wave. The refractive index of the medium can be either large or small according to various applications and purposes.|$|E

50|$|Application of Uniformity Tape {{also appears}} to provide {{ancillary}} benefits.
