Changing views and concrete experiences induced the port to widen the initially limited circle of regular users of berths. We study this case {{in order to increase}} our understanding of the dynamic interrelationship between <b>organisational</b> memory and <b>learning.</b> While <b>organisational</b> memory guides the application of routines, this practical experience may also question underlying beliefs. Our study of deliberations by the Rotterdam government - to a significant degree representing the preferences of the local business elite - demonstrates how so-called lower order learning on the level of routines induces a so-called higher order learning on the level of beliefs. Finally, our case-study suggests that the traumatic nature of initial experiences that are part of organisational memory may hinder the deliberation of beliefs and thus retard higher order <b>learning.</b> <b>organisational</b> memory, <b>learning,</b> local government, ports,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} firms from the knowledge and learning perspective. The survey covered {{a random sample of}} 120 private manufacturing firms in industrial zones in the Yangon area. Two broad categories of learning are determined: Internal and external. Internal learning is captured by two domains of <b>learning,</b> individual and <b>organisational,</b> whereas external <b>learning</b> involves customers, competitors and suppliers. Firm performance is evaluated using two broad groups of aspects: Non-financial and financial. The ordinary least square (OLS) results show that first, different domains of learning affect firms’ performance differently. Individual, <b>organisational</b> and competitor <b>learning</b> impact firms’ non-financial performance, whereas other forms of learning do not. Second, the effect of different domains of learning on performance differs in accordance with the different aspects of performance measurement. Individual learning can explain firms' financial performance both directly and indirectly. However, <b>organisational</b> and competitor <b>learning</b> explain firm financial performance indirectly. Third, non-financial performance affects financial performance. Thus, the empirical results have important implications...|$|R

40|$|OMPHALOS is an Object-oriented Model for Predicting Human Activities of <b>Learning</b> <b>Organisational</b> Systems. It {{has been}} {{developed}} in late 90 ’s in Cardiff University for modelling complex technical, social and economical systems.

The general design approach, the implementation of the system and the results will be discussed in this paper. 1...|$|R

50|$|Activity {{theory has}} an {{interesting}} {{approach to the}} difficult problems of learning and, in particular, tacit knowledge. Learning has been a favourite subject of management theorists, but {{it has often been}} presented in an abstract way separated from the work processes to which the learning should apply. Activity theory provides a potential corrective to this tendency. For instance, Engeström's review of Nonaka's work on knowledge creation suggests enhancements based on activity theory, in particular suggesting that the <b>organisational</b> <b>learning</b> process includes preliminary stages of goal and problem formation not found in Nonaka. Lompscher, rather than seeing learning as transmission, sees the formation of learning goals and thestudent's understanding of which things they need to acquire as the key to the formation of the learning activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{contained in}} this paper focuses on providing a possible framework or approach in respect of how manufacturing companies can economically introduce environmentally friendly practices to their production operations, whilst {{at the same time}} encouraging <b>organisational</b> and operational <b>learning</b> with the aim of eventual evolution of the firm into an eco-efficient concern. A key premise associated with the approach advocated is economical <b>organisational</b> and operational <b>learning</b> over time, thus providing a sequential movement of the company through various stages of cultural change and technological capability to eventually achieve eco-efficiency in its production activities. At each stage in the process, it is suggested that a balance must be maintained between on the one hand, a reduction in operational economics consistent with on the other hand, an improvement in the environmental sustainability of company activities. To that end, some previously suggested monitoring metrics are examined in the text for their efficacy and economic rapport via hypothetical examples of how they might be applied in practice to monitor movement towards industrial–environmental sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Instructional reform {{requires}} {{learning by}} those who implement it. Learning involves a process of reconstructing knowledge and beliefs entailed by complex behavioral change. A cognitive perspective of policy implementation underscores that behavioural changes have a fundamental cognitive component. By assuming that policy implementation as a relatively straightforward process of transmitting behavioural rules drawn up by policy-makers to those responsible for implementing the rules, a top-down policy implementation tends to undermine the learning needs {{of those who are}} implementing instructional change. This implies a connection between the <b>organisational</b> factor, <b>learning</b> and change. There is a rich base of literature on educational change theory and learning theory. What is lacking is research attempting to link these fields. This case study sheds light on the discussion about <b>organisational</b> factor, <b>learning</b> and change by investigating the implementation of a thinking skills policy in the context of teacher education in a fully centralised education system. This involves the examination of how eight teacher educators conceptualised the thinking skills policy and implemented the intended change in their teaching. Specifically, the research questions seek to examine the acquisition of knowledge and the alteration of belief which guide the change in practice with regard to thinking skills policy. Data were collected through interviews, observations and questionnaires. The study produces three key findings. The first finding concerns the gap and uncertainties of was the absence of the intended change in practice. The third finding relates the many barriers that impede the change in teaching practice to the lack of consideration of systemic factors in the change process. All the results are connected to the issue of the organisational factors as the framing that underlies the change process.
