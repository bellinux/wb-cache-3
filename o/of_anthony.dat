The Metropolitan Police {{settled out of court}} in 1999, awarding him £50,000 for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.

5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the {{remarriage}} of a lady-in-waiting.

The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated in a number of 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E

5|$|The Ashleys and Ashley-Coopers {{have made}} Wimborne St Giles their home since the 15th century. The small village of Wimborne St Giles rests {{within the family}} estate itself.

5|$|The Land of Lost Content: the Biography <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Chenevix-Trench is a biographical {{book about}} the life of British {{headmaster}} Anthony Chenevix-Trench, written by Mark Peel. Chenevix-Trench had been a widely acclaimed teacher at Shrewsbury School, and subsequently headmaster at Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College, but was later criticised for his approach to corporal punishment. Published by Pentland Press in 1996, the book received mixed reviews, with questions over its neutrality and writing style, but plaudits for its insights into British culture and education.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in the New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies and the historical records of the early colonizers. Following the pioneering example <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak {{when compared to the}} statistically led investigations in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

5|$|The {{effort to}} avoid {{introducing}} the conviction for the murder <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Smith worked against Silcott too. It meant that the jury could not be told that he had signed on for his bail at Tottenham police station at around 7 pm {{on the evening of}} Blakelock's death. This was when witnesses had placed Silcott at a Broadwater Youth Association meeting, making inflammatory speeches against the police.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of seven men and five women, including one Afro-Caribbean woman. They were not {{told that it}} was Silcott's fourth murder trial, {{that he had been}} out on bail for the murder <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Smith when Blakelock was killed, or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder. Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, GCB (4 June 1746 – 14 November 1816) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Navy, who saw action in several battles during an {{extensive}} career that was punctuated by a number of highly controversial incidents. Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under fire at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, where he saved several hundred Spanish lives at great risk to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for his conduct by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two highly controversial courts-martial, those <b>of</b> <b>Anthony</b> Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E
