Planning for ERP systems and their implementations requires an integrated approach to meet the requirements of various functional areas.

From a point of view of sustainable development, a trade restriction measure has to fulfill at least the following requirements: it should support those producers/market operators by preferential market access who internalise the real costs of production in their price structure and make sure that the specific trade measures do not contradict efforts on sustainability in exporting countries. Against this background we introduce an innovative model – auctioning producers' <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the EU. <b>Issues</b> concerning the auction design and its GATT/WTO compatibility are also discussed. In sum, the auctioning of direct producers' offers seems to be a practicable solution for fair trade with agricultural produce from developing countries.

40|$|Typologies {{are widely}} used in {{research}} on federalism, e. g. to distinguish dual from cooperative or coming-together from holding-together federations. More general, ideal types, archetypes and categories are frequently used in political science research to define concepts and classify cases. As recently as in 2014, Filho et al. pointed out that Cluster Analysis is still hardly used {{when it comes to}} developing typologies in political science. Rather, political scientists rely on more intuitive methods or factor analysis. Our paper argues that Cluster Analysis is of great usefulness because it a) focuses on the relationship between cases and not variables and b) draws on empirical data when identifying the clusters. This paper proposes to apply this fruitful approach to the field of federalism to exemplify its major heuristic potential. Furthermore, we emphasize that testing the secondary validity is a crucial step. Our paper provides two original examples from comparative federal politics and public management that illustrate the strength of Cluster Analysis both in testing and generating hypotheses through the establishment of typologies. For both examples, the validity of the Cluster Analysis is tested by checking for correlations between the clusters and the distribution of power. Hence, the typologies established through Cluster Analysis not only define our respective dependent variables related to aspects of intergovernmental coordination within federations and the normative density of evaluation clauses in the Swiss federation, but also <b>offer</b> strong insights <b>in</b> <b>issues</b> of regional autonomy.

The results suggested that the market capitalisation, rela­tive size of the issue and the return on capital employed were of importance. The statistical significance of the discount, measured as the difference between the current market price and the subscrip­ tion price and the importance of the pre-issue share price was difficult to explain. Secondly, a postal questionnaire (n = 110) was used to determine private shareholders' knowledge of rights issues with particular reference to the importance of the issue price. The respondents were randomly chosen from two public companies and the data did not exhibit a statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} Over half of the respondents showed an ill-informed view and were classed as naive. The naive view was independent of the shareholders' characteristics. We have strong evidence to argue that the sample is representative of private shareholders as a population.
