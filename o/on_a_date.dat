5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> traditionally given as 12 October 633.

The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
