5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of central defender Dave Evans and right winger John Hendrie {{to build on the}} {{previous}} season's high finish. McCall {{was an integral part of}} the team as City won the Division Three championship in 1984–85, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players. The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers. The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to Lincoln City. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the Bradford City stadium fire when the Valley Parade ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured. After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to Bradford Royal Infirmary and Pinderfields Hospital trying to find his father. His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> head and was in hospital for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E

He fell unconscious and sustained injuries <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> Kathirvelu had nose and head injuries. Thinakaran had injuries <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> leg. Parthiban, 19, had stitches on the face and head.

5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only {{to the fact that he}} had been without food or water for three days.|$|E
25|$|He {{was said}} to act embarrassed by this {{condition}} and most photographs show him wearing red mittens or black coverings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet where the bleeding occurred. At the time of Padre Pio's death, his body appeared unwounded, {{with no sign of}} scarring. There was a report that doctors who examined his body found it empty of all blood.|$|E
25|$|Cunanan next {{drove to}} Chicago and killed 72-year-old Lee Miglin, a {{prominent}} real estate developer, on May 4, 1997. Miglin had been bound {{with duct tape}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet and wrapped around his head. He was then stabbed over 20 times with a screwdriver and had his throat sawed open with a hacksaw. Following this murder, the FBI added Cunanan to its Ten Most Wanted list.|$|E

25|$|By {{the rules}} {{governing}} military societies, a man who murdered or accidentally killed another tribe member had blood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> was prohibited from joining a society. A society member who committed such a crime was expelled and outlawed. Porcupine Bear was expelled from the Dog Soldiers, {{and he and his}} relatives had to camp apart {{from the rest of the}} Cheyenne. The Dog Soldiers were disgraced by Porcupine Bear's act. The other chiefs forbade them from leading war against the Kiowa.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, Thomas Edison {{investigated}} materials' {{ability to}} fluoresce {{when exposed to}} X-rays, and found that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, even before the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally {{had a habit of}} testing X-ray tubes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Ramsay {{performed}} a successful resuscitation {{of the heart}} by massage, opening the thorax of a patient who had clinically died during operation; becoming the first surgeon in Australasia to perform a successful resuscitation. Designing and building St. Margaret's Hospital in Launceston, Ramsay entered private practice in 1912 upon the hospital's foundation. However, he retained his connection with the Launceston General Hospital, serving as an honorary consulting surgeon for the hospital. Interested {{in the works of}} Wilhelm Röntgen in regards to the potential of deep x-ray therapy, Ramsay had permanent scarring <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face as a result of experiments with x-ray. In 1919, he visited Germany to purchase x-ray equipment from Siemens.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} week versus the Carolina Panthers, Carr dislocated the pinkie <b>on</b> <b>his</b> throwing <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> had {{to miss a}} series. He returned the next drive with a glove <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> finished the game, {{which resulted in a}} 35-32 victory. The win brought the Raiders to a 9-2 record and clinched their first winning season since 2002.|$|R

25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} held on 21 May 2012 {{concerning}} the Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum, Pat Kenny got down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees and shouted at a farmer {{in the audience}} to shut up. He also promised a debate on the CAP [...] "in January"scheduling of which would have occurred two months after {{it was announced that}} The Frontline had been axed.|$|E

500|$|Henderson was {{so proud}} of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest. In 2002, {{following}} an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, [...] "He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is." ...|$|E

Jackman was pleased to see that the script allowed Wolverine to expand his character choices, as instead of [...] questioning whether he would remain a loner or join the X-Men, Logan now is asked if he will play a leadership role in the X-Men.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{suffered}} an acknowledged [...] "drumming slump" [...] around 1980, and his time-keeping skills were criticized by Springsteen. What could pass unnoticed in concert became apparent on record, and Weinberg practiced drumming components for months {{in order to}} regain a fine sense of timing. Weinberg also suffered from repetitive stress injury and tendinitis, eventually requiring seven operations <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> wrists. He studied for a while with noted jazz drummer Joe Morello; Weinberg credited Morello for helping him {{to learn how to}} play with the tendinitis.|$|E

500|$|Hansell, at {{the request}} of Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower, was {{assigned}} on July 12, 1942 as Officer in Charge, Air Section, ETOUSA headquarters, and simultaneously as deputy theater air officer for Major General Carl A. Spaatz, commander of the Eighth Air Force. [...] His duties were to mold Eisenhower’s opinion on the use of airpower, guided by Spaatz, but there is little indication that he succeeded. [...] He also flew combat in a B-17 to gain first-hand experience with daylight precision bombing, attacking the Longueau marshalling yard at Amiens, France, on August 20, 1942. During the mission he developed frostbite <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> spent several days recovering from the effects.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} nine days, Slotin {{suffered}} an [...] "agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas", including severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, swollen hands, erythema, [...] "massive blisters <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> forearms", intestinal paralysis, and gangrene. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a “three-dimensional sunburn.” By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of “mental confusion.” His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. He ultimately experienced [...] "a total disintegration of bodily functions" [...] and slipped into a coma. Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May, {{in the presence of}} his parents. He was buried in Shaarey Zedek Cemetery, Winnipeg, on 2 June 1946.|$|E
