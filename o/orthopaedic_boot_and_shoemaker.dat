5000|$|The game of Rugby {{football}} {{owes its}} name to the school. The legend of William Webb Ellis and the origin of the game is commemorated by a plaque. The story has been known to be a myth since it was investigated by the Old Rugbeian Society in 1895. There were no standard rules for football in Webb Ellis's time at Rugby (1816-1825) and most varieties involved carrying the ball. The games played at Rugby were organised by the pupils and not the masters, the rules being a matter of custom and not written down. They were frequently changed and modified with each new intake of students. The sole source of the story is Matthew Bloxam, a former pupil but not a contemporary of Webb Ellis. In October 1876, four years after the death of Webb Ellis, {{in a letter to the}} school newspaper The Meteor he quotes an unknown friend relating the story to him. He elaborated on the story four years later in another letter to The Meteor, but shed no further light on its source. Richard Lindon, a <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoemaker</b> who had premises across the street from the School's main entrance in Lawrence Sheriff Street, is credited with the invention of the [...] "oval" [...] rugby ball, the rubber inflatable bladder and the brass hand pump.|$|R

50|$|The company's {{most famous}} welly, the {{original}} Green wellington, was made over 50 {{years ago in}} the winter of 1955. It was the first <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>boot</b> made by Hunter, and was launched alongside the Royal Hunter - another boot that remains in Hunter's range today. Reaction from trade was slow, and an order of 36 pairs considered an achievement. However, the company persisted, taking them to county shows and trade fairs. Thought of as more up-market than the traditional black wellington of the time, the 'Original' tended, initially, to be worn by middle to upper class rural people, who are still sometimes referred to as the 'Green Welly Brigade'.|$|R
