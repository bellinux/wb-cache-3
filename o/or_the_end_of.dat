5|$|Until {{the middle}} <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 1700s, {{much of the}} Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} was on the frontier. During this time, there were many forts, such as Fort Titzell in the watershed. In 1769, the northern side of Buffalo Creek was surveyed. In the same year, {{the area in the}} vicinity of the creek was opened to settlers. John Sierer was among the first to arrive, settling on the creek in 1769. The prominent Revolutionary War veteran Colonel John Kelly built an estate on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek. In 1780, there was an Indian attack near the mouth of the creek.|$|E

50|$|Although this phobia {{is often}} {{developed}} {{at a young}} age, it can develop later in life as well.

25|$|Oceanic {{overturn}} is {{a disruption}} of thermo-haline circulation which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water {{to the surface and}} therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a glaciation, although an overturn {{at the start of a}} glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.|$|E
25|$|Telephone {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} prefixed with special services, such as vertical service codes, that contain signaling events other than numbers, {{most notably the}} star (*) and the number sign (#). Vertical service codes enable or disable special telephony services either on a per-call basis, or for the station or telephone line until changed. The use of the number sign is most frequently used as a marker signal to indicate the end of digit sequences <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> other procedures; as a terminator it avoids operational delays when waiting for expiration of automatic time-out periods.|$|E

25|$|Grief is {{a natural}} {{response}} to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away.

25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr. In the 19th century, large sundials {{were built in}} these vineyards so that the workers would know what time to break for lunch <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the work day. Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E

25|$|The {{repeated}} wave {{of attacks}} {{carried out by}} the Italians would render irrelevant the air-raid alarm system since it would no longer be clear if the sirens were announcing the beginning <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an attack. Furthermore, they used delayed-fuse bombs designed to pass through the roof and then explode inside the building and a new type of bomb which exploded with a strong lateral force, so as to destroy things and persons within a few inches of the ground. The bombings affected all the city and the bombers didn't attempt to destroy military targets. On the night of 18 the working class districts were badly hit. The Italian bombers dropped 44 tons of bombs, and there were more than 1,000 civilians dead (Beevor: 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded; Preston: around 1,000 dead; and Thomas: 1,300 dead and 2,000 wounded).|$|E
25|$|Excavations in the {{old town}} have {{discovered}} well-preserved houses showing some luxury. Among them, the most monumental are those in the rectory garden of rue Clemenceau. These show a comparable level {{to that of the}} Gallo-Roman domus such as those of Saint-Romain-en-Gal. Large parts of the floor mosaic are organised around a courtyard with a marble fountain. The building dates from the late third century, although parts date {{from the end of the}} Hellenistic era <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Republic. Another house paved with porphyry and green stone was excavated between rue des Palmiers and the rue de la Blancherie.

Finds from the end of the Hellenistic era and the end of the Roman Republic is present on both sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{chronology}} {{established by}} Marian Wenzel considers they {{developed from the}} plate headstones with the oldest from 1220 (probably first somewhere in the mid-12th century), monumental emerged somewhere in 1360, those with visual representations around 1435-1477, and that total production ended in 1505. However some consider that it lasted until the late 16th century, with rare examples that continued until the 18th century.

In the latter upright or standing forms can be seen influence of the nišan - the upright monolithic stones on top of the Muslim (Turkish) graves, which emerge already in the end of the 14th century in conquered parts of Macedonia and Serbia. This form is predominantly found in Serbia and Eastern Bosnia.|$|E
