All OSI application layer standards use ASN. 1 in order to specify data structures such as mail messages or directory entries that are exchanged in distributed applications. ASN. 1 allows to define complex data types, which are encoded in a standardized exchange format, the so-called transfersyntax. To automate the tedious task to program the encoding and decoding routines by hand, socalled ASN. 1 compilers can be used (e. g. MAVROS [Huit 91], Pepsy [Onio 89], [Neuf 90], [Harv 91] and [Koiv 92]). Today, ASN. 1 is a well-established language {{that has been used}} not only in all OSI application layer standards, but also for non-OSI standards such as the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the <b>Open</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> (ODIF).

40|$|Abstract. Online {{access to}} complex {{compound}} documents with client side search and browsing capability {{is one of}} the key requirements of effective content management. “DjVu ” (Déjà Vu) is a highly efficient document image compression methodology, a file format, and a delivery platform that, when considered together, has shown to effectively address these issues [1]. Originally developed for scanned color documents, the DjVu technology was recently expanded to electronic documents. The small file sizes and very efficient document browsing make DjVu a compelling alternative to such <b>document</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> as PostScript or PDF. In addition, DjVu offers a uniform viewing experience for electronic or scanned original documents, on any platform, over any connection speed, which is ideal for digital libraries and electronic publishing. This paper describes the basics of DjVu encoding, with emphasis on the particular challenges posed by electronic sources.

Some {{progress has}} been made on the translation of page description languages [...] Postscript to Interpress and Interpress to Postscript. However, these developments are of no assistance in the sharing of documents that may need to be revised. The ISO OSI standards for revisable form <b>documents</b> <b>interchange</b> continue to evolve with the Standard Generalized Markup Language, the Office Document Architecture, and the Office <b>document</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> offering great promise for the future. While the ultimate solution to <b>document</b> <b>interchange</b> is universal acceptance of an interchange standard, some intermediate solution is required to meet the needs that exist today. It is in this context that document conversion systems are considered. The approaches to conversion fall in two broad categories. The first category includes systems that hard code each conversion. The second category of system rely on an intermediate metalanguage [...] a standard. This paper describes a hybrid system for converting files created by one text processing system to a format suitable for another. The discussions covers the design principles for an extended machine and table driven approach. Tables allow for user involvement in customizing and developing new conversions while an extended machine allows for logical and arithmetic control of the conversion. The paper describes the kinds of copymarks found in text files, sets out the scope of what a copymark conversion engine must do, describes how various approaches tackle the problem, and describes how the conversion engine produced accomplishes these goals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Interchange</b> <b>formats</b> {{have been}} the {{backbone}} of the EDA industry for several years. They are used as a way of helping the development of design flows that integrate foreign tools using formats with different syntax and, more importantly, different semantics. The need for integrating tools coming from different communities is even more severe for hybrid systems because of the relative immaturity of the field and the intrinsic difficulty of the mathematical underpinnings. In this paper, we provide a discussion about <b>interchange</b> <b>formats</b> for hybrid systems, we survey the approaches used by different tools for analysis (simulation and formal verification) and synthesis of hybrid systems, and we give a recommendation for an <b>interchange</b> <b>format</b> for hybrid systems based on the Metropolis metamodel.
