40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading on mechanical and thermal conductivity properties were investigated for NR composite.

Natural rubber was loaded with different concentrations of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000) phr. The addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to {{a slight increase in}} thermal conductivity values of composites but it still lies around range of thermal insulating materials. Also addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to improvement of mechanical properties of composites. The crosslink density of NR composite increases with the increase of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading until 600 phr and after that it decreases due to the stronger the rubber–filler interaction. This leads to the decrease of the swelling index that has the opposite trend of crosslink density. So, the sample with 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> is considered the optimum concentration from the swelling measurement. Filler loading results in pronounced increase in the tensile modulus and decease in the elongation at fracture which reflects the reinforcement effect of the filler. The yield stress increases with <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading increment. This delays the permanent disruption of matrix morphology. So, the optimum concentration which is 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading agrees with the swelling and mechanical measurements which has desirable thermal insulation and high mechanical properties and decreases the cost of materials to 82 % of the NR cost...|$|R
