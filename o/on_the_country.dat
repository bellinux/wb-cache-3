5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of {{topographical}} maps causing a real problem in {{the first months of}} the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world was focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the third most intense hurricane to strike the country with a pressure of 920mbar, though its winds were not as strong as Andrew.|$|E

5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators.

5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland.

The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The storm's intensity resulted in damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement.

5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E
