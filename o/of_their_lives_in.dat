5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> <b>In</b> Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|In English, Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), {{often called}} the {{foremost}} satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they spent most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> England. The Anglo-Irish novel {{came to the fore}} in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E

These are known as anadromous fish, and include, for instance, salmon, trout and three-spined stickleback. Some other kinds of fish are, on the contrary, born in salt water, but live most of or parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> adult <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> fresh water; for instance the eels. These are known as catadromous fish.|$|R
5|$|The coup was {{precipitated by}} a {{heightening}} {{in the power}} struggle between the party's old guard, represented by Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, and Munif al-Razzaz, and the younger factions adhering to a Neo-Ba'athist position. On 21 February, supporters of the old guard in the army ordered the transfer of their rivals. Two days later, the Military Committee, backing the younger factions, launched a coup that involved violent fighting in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, and Latakia. As {{a result of the}} coup, the party's historical founders fled the country and spent the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> exile.|$|E
5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible explanation is that trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate {{with more than one}} female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E

5|$|Max Mosley {{was born}} on 3 April 1940 in London, {{in the early years}} of the Second World War. His father, Sir Oswald Mosley, had been a Labour minister, and a Member of Parliament for both the Conservative and Labour parties in the 1920s before leaving {{mainstream}} politics and becoming leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s. The month after Max's birth, Sir Oswald, who had campaigned for a negotiated peace between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany, was interned by the British Authorities under Defence Regulation 18B, along with other active fascists in Britain. Max's mother, Lady Diana Mosley, was imprisoned a month later. Max and his older brother Alexander were not included in their parents' internment and as a result were separated from them for the first few years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> <b>In</b> December 1940, then-prime minister Winston Churchill, asked Home Secretary Herbert Morrison to ensure Lady Mosley was able to see Max regularly.|$|E
5|$|Most of Denmarks's major {{publishing}} {{houses are}} based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many {{of the most important}} contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) spent much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter Høeg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15–18 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they had thought to be wiped out by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at sub-light speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live out the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the planet for fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, {{and the rest of}} the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders the tractor beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E
5|$|The Normans and French {{who arrived}} after the conquest saw {{themselves}} as different from the English. They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy, spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture. For many years, to be English was {{to be associated with}} military failure and serfdom. During the 12th century, the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and cohabitation. By the end of the 12th century, and possibly as early as the 1150, contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending, and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend. The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values, however, and French remained the language of the court, business and international affairs, even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation. By the 14th century, however, French was increasingly having to be formally taught, rather than being learnt naturally in the home, although the aristocracy would typically spend many years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> France and remained entirely comfortable working in French.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for {{three to five years}} as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E
