5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism</b> and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{to fight}} the loss of {{regional}} diversity, many in France have promoted forms <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism</b> and encouraged cultural enclaves (communautarisme), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French multiculturalism has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the collective identity, the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups {{that have come to}} France since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Later, between 1967 and 1971, {{during the}} final years of the {{step-by-step}} dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, instead of trying to make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism.</b>|$|E

50|$|Canadian Joseph Garcea {{explores the}} {{validity}} <b>of</b> attacks on <b>multiculturalism</b> because it supposedly segregates the peoples <b>of</b> Canada; <b>multiculturalism</b> hurts the Canadian, Québécois, and Aboriginal culture, identity, and nationalism projects; and, it perpetuates conflicts between and within groups.

50|$|International Students' Day is an {{international}} observance of student community, held annually on November 17. Originally commemorating the Nazi German storming of Czech universities in 1939 and the subsequent killing and sending of students to concentration camps, a number of universities now mark it, sometimes on a day other than November 17, for a nonpolitical celebration <b>of</b> the <b>multiculturalism</b> <b>of</b> their international students.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} trends can be {{explained}} due to the growing proportion of younger people moving into Brunswick. There is a substantial group of tertiary students partly due {{to a combination of}} affordable rents and the relative proximity and ease of access to the University of Melbourne and to RMIT University, which also has a small campus in Brunswick. There is also a growing population of young professionals and increasing signs of gentrification. These diverse groups live together with little discord, and Brunswick is well known as a successful example <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians {{stemming from the}} French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States. In the 20th century, immigrants from African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the ongoing arrival {{of large numbers of}} immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds, adding the theme <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism</b> to the debate. Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism</b> abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

40|$|Building {{on recent}} argumentation {{concerning}} {{the relationship between}} wilderness and multiculturalism and whiteness in Canada, this essay argues {{that the relationship between}} wilderness and tolerance, one <b>of</b> <b>multiculturalism's</b> operative terms, offers a potentially rich vein for researching and theorizing liberal biopolitics and whiteness in Canada. To formulate this argument the essay historicizes the pairing of tolerance and wilderness in Edwardian Canada through the figure of Flora MacDonald Denison, an important early twentieth-century Canadian feminist and labour activist, a wilderness enthusiast, Theosophist/spiritualist and Walt Whitman devotee...|$|R
500|$|Riel's {{historical}} reputation {{has long}} been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation, or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government.
