50|$|Open Market Operations: Open market <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> used {{to steer}} {{interest}} rates. Most of the Open Market <b>Operations</b> <b>are</b> completed through Repo <b>operations.</b> Repo <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> repurchase agreements, {{where the government}} sells securities to traders, usually on a short-term agreement.|$|R
5|$|This {{addition}} <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> {{central to}} classical mechanics, in which vectors are interpreted as forces.|$|E
5|$|One {{must prove}} that this <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all the {{properties}} of real addition follow immediately from {{the properties of}} rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} {{negative}} real numbers {{are not always}} defined and are discontinuous even where defined. In fact, they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the denominator being an odd integer. When dealing with complex numbers the complex number <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> normally used instead.|$|E

5|$|To {{service the}} {{enlarged}} network, Grønlandsfly began acquiring DHC-7s, planes particularly {{suited to the}} often severe weather conditions in Greenland. The first was delivered on 29 September 1979, followed by more over the next decade. These planes remain in active service, serving every airport except Nerlerit Inaat near Ittoqqortoormiit, whose <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> handled by Air Iceland under contract with Greenland Home Rule.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} several power-associative binary {{operations}} defined on a set, any of which might be iterated, {{it is common to}} indicate which <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> being repeated by placing its symbol in the superscript. Thus, x∗n is , while x#n is , whatever the operations ∗ and # might be.|$|E
5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E

The causal relationship between two <b>operations</b> <b>is</b> defined formally by Lamport's [...] "happened-before" [...] relation. When two <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> not causally dependent, they are concurrent. Two concurrent <b>operations</b> can <b>be</b> executed in different order on two different document copies.|$|R
25|$|<b>Operation</b> Chronicle <b>was</b> the Allied {{invasion}} of Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands during World War II, in the South West Pacific {{as part of}} Operation Cartwheel.

5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E
5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. The <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E
5|$|A vector {{processor}} is a CPU or computer {{system that can}} execute the same instruction on large sets of data. Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> A = B × C, where A, B, and C are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit floating-point numbers. They {{are closely related to}} Flynn's SIMD classification.|$|E

However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
5|$|As a {{condition}} of receiving the grant, the P.R. Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons. This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual participants are selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> reviewed and approved by the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E
5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E

50|$|In brief, XLA is {{described}} in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols. Change comes with a whisper. This whisper presents a triple isomorphism. The mental <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> {{the same as the}} symmetry <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> the same as the logical operations. Said the other way around, the logical <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> the same as the symmetry <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> the same as the mental operations. Said again in a different order, the logical <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> the same as the mental <b>operations</b> <b>are</b> the same as the symmetry operations. Here we have a prime example of cognitive ergonomics at its best. The single act of performing any one automatically performs the other two.|$|R

It considers the nature of Knowledge Operations and their inter-relationship with Information Operations. Whereas the foci of Information <b>Operations</b> <b>are</b> information and information systems, the foci of Knowledge <b>Operations</b> <b>are</b> thoughts, thinking processes, and Thought Systems. Information <b>Operations</b> <b>are</b> concerned with the symbols to which meaning has been assigned and {{the ways and means}} by which such symbols <b>are</b> processed; Knowledge <b>Operations</b> <b>are</b> concerned with the ways and means by which meaning is assigned, derived and shared.

5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining <b>operation</b> <b>is</b> projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E
