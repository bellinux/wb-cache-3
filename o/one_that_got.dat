Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E

However, he has had small roles {{in a number of}} high-profile American films like The Three Musketeers and Alien 3. His role in Alien 3 was originally larger, but much of it was edited out of the final print. The cut footage {{can be seen in the}} extended version of the film.|$|E

This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films.|$|E

25|$|Sato's {{next move}} is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> {{him the most}} media {{attention}} as he signed with the World Wrestling Federation {{for the first time}} in his career. In early 1990 Sato along with former rival Pat Tanaka were introduced to the WWF as The Orient Express by manager Mr. Fuji. During this run, Sato introduced the Sitout Powerbomb to mainstream American wrestling for the first time. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud because Mr. Fuji managed both teams. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express took on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom’s massive size advantage.|$|E

One of his victims on 5September may have been Oberleutnant Franz von Werra, who was captured and subsequently became famous as [...] "the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> away".

500|$|By {{the time}} Quatermass and the Pit finally entered {{production}} Val Guest was occupied on Casino Royale (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) {{and he was}} best known for The <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away (1957) and A Night to Remember (1958). Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963–64), The Saint (1962–69) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as A Night to Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as A Night to Remember and The <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism {{it needed to be}} convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was [...] "taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it." [...] He was also impressed with Hammer Films’ lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he {{was surprised to find that}} Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as “Roy Ward Baker”, having previously been credited as “Roy Baker”. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.|$|E

500|$|After {{training}} {{under his}} father, and his uncle the luchador known as [...] "El Gallo Giro", {{he made his}} debut as [...] "Kahoz Jr.", {{as a tribute to}} his father's final wrestling character. From 1988 until 1993 he wrestled as Kahoz Jr. for various promotions in Mexico. His father, however, urged him to change gimmicks to the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> his father the most fame [...] "Astro Rey Jr.". As Astro Rey Jr. or simply [...] "Astro Jr." [...] he travelled the world and wrestled extensively in Mexico and Japan. On March 22, 1999 Astro Rey Jr. won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship from Arkangel de la Muerte and defended it several times during his 19-month reign.

500|$|Tricky Stewart {{stated that}} he and Perry [...] "always knew that the records [...] created were special [...] {{at the time it}} was more {{contractual}} obligation [...] ". He elaborated that they were originally excluded from the project to balance the original record with tracks from other producers, in addition to Perry not needing more songs at the time. The expanded album begins with the twelve tracks included on the standard version of Teenage Dream. The newly recorded material for the reissue begins with an acoustic rendition of [...] "The <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away" [...] as the thirteenth track. [...] "Part of Me" [...] is a power pop song that lyrically acts as an [...] "emotional breakup anthem". It was speculated that its concept was inspired by Perry's relationship with her ex-husband Russell Brand.|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E

500|$|Rumors had {{surfaced}} {{during the}} 1996 season that manager Terry Collins {{did not get}} along well with Bagwell and Biggio, largely contributing to his dismissal. [...] The Astros hired team color commentator Larry Dierker after the season to replace him. [...] According to his autobiography, This Ain't Brain Surgery, Dierker was asked during the interview how he would handle the players. [...] His response: [...] "'Look, I'm tired of this Bagwell and Biggio s---,' I said. 'Bagwell and Biggio {{will not be a}} problem, believe me.' [...] I now believe that this statement is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> me the job." [...] The Astros won division titles in four of five seasons with Dierker as manager; however, in each instance, they did not advance past {{the first round of the}} playoffs, and 2001 was Dierker's last season as the club's manager.|$|E

With this political writing, historical research on Latrun tends to concentrate on the 1980s with the work of Arié Itzhaki, [...] "Latrun" [...] (in 2 volumes). It gives the exact number of victims, but, at the contrary of Israel Beer (meanwhile caught as spying for USSR), it depicts the battle as [...] "The hardest in the history of Tsahal", and it puts the responsibility of the defeat on Ben-Gurion, who panicked about Jerusalem, and tactical errors on the brigade commanders and not on the immigrants who received (from his point of view) a sufficient training.|$|E
