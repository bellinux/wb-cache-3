25|$|Goto and Nagumo {{once more}} {{assemble}} the original Section 2 members {{in an abandoned}} subway passage as they embark on a secret operation to apprehend Yukihito Tsuge, a former GSDF officer who planned the terrorist attacks as revenge {{for the failure of}} a UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia back in 1999. With the threat of US intervention looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the Ginza Line to approach an artificial island Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also takes care <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> his end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is actually one of Tsuge's cohorts. After a fierce fight inside the artificial island's tunnel which results in flooding, the team evacuates the tunnel while Nagumo breaks through to finally arrest Tsuge.|$|E
25|$|Lady Cripps {{returned}} to England with her sick grandson. Just before Christmas 1962, Joe {{was released from}} prison and allowed to return to legal practice. The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking care <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> the home front. She kept an eye on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

Of the dream sequence, Hamm said, [...] "Unlike a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> our show, it's very visceral and immediate and scary and weird" [...] with Hamm noting that Weiner compared the episode to a horror film. The scene in which Peggy blackmails Roger was one of Elisabeth Moss's favorite moments, with Moss saying that she was [...] "playing Roger Sterling" [...] in that scene.|$|E

During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as the [...] and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General Earl B. Hailston said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that [...] "The airplane... became the envy of pilots even from my background... there's an awful lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking me ...

500|$|The {{division}} of royalties {{was a source}} of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for [...] "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part [...] "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: [...] "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> there." [...] Mason recalled: [...] "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." [...] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: [...] "Animals...wasn't a fun record to make... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band... that it was only because of him that [...] were still going... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the piece}} had its first West End revival in 1970 {{the play was}} warmly though not rapturously praised by the critics, {{but by the time}} of the next major production, in 1976, Irving Wardle of The Times considered, [...] "Stylistically, it is Coward's masterpiece: his most {{complete}} success in imposing his own view <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> the brute facts of existence," [...] and Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote of Coward's influence on Harold Pinter. In 2004, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "With Hay Fever and Private Lives, Blithe Spirit strikes me as being one of Coward 's three indisputable comic masterpieces.

2500|$|When Salazar was {{replaced}} in office by Marcello Caetano, some liberalization was promised. In an interview {{given to the}} O Estado de S. Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper, Caetano himself promised to enact a new Press law shortly thereafter. However, little did change. According to [...] "Evolution in Continuity", Caetano's political doctrine, [...] "Prior Censorship" [...] was now termed [...] "Prior Exam". The State Secretary for Information and Tourism would say that: [...] "Nothing has changed in this house, not the spirit, nor the devotion to essential values, nor the course of action", maintaining what was Salazar's stated purpose for the institution: [...] "To maintain the truth". As {{an example of the}} [...] "new" [...] state <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>on</b> October 26, 1972, for an article about the prohibition of a play (an adaptation of [...] "O Arco de Sant’Ana" [...] by Almeida Garrett), the Prior Exam Services from Oporto rejected a version that referred to the prohibition: [...] "Don't mention it was forbidden.

She said that [...] "Murder" [...] "isn't serious, {{based on a true story}} or a threat.... It's a metaphor about a girl who can get away with murder because of who she is" [...] and said that [...] "Rule Breaker" [...] was an attempt to [...] "capture that badass feeling you get sometimes after watching a movie like True Romance.

[...] She called [...] "Never Dream Alone" [...] "a sweet emotional song that has been stripped down to piano, strings and vocals" [...] and said that it was her favorite from the album. Regarding [...] "Hot Stuff", Simpson has said that it [...] "is meant to be a fun song.... A lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> the record are laughing at situations, poking fun at things. With that, when you go somewhere and girls give you the mean eye. You're like, 'oh, wow– this is crazy.' 'Hot Stuff' makes fun of that. That song is meant to be a good time." [...] According to Simpson, [...] "Bittersweet World" [...] is [...] "about people coming together and not judging each other".
