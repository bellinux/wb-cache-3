40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{and some}} {{organochlorine}} pesticides we re measured in some marine organisms of different trophic levels, sampled in the Belgian coastal waters. Because of their persistence and their lipophilic character they accumulate in lipoidal tissues, causing higher <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residue</b> levels in animals {{with a high}} adiposity. To compare the residue levels of different organisms lipid based data must be used. The concept of biological magnification controlled by mass transfers of residues through food chains is questioned because predatory fish like cod contained similar or even lower residue levels than organisms of a lower trophic levellike the peacock worm. This supports the concept that the organochlorine levels are controlled by the equilibrium partitioning of the lipophilic pollutants between body lipids and surrounding water.

In particular, horticultural and floricultural activities have intensified on the riparian fringe of Lake Naivasha, a RAMSAR site. The lake supports a large variety of wildlife and avifauna in particular. In the 1980 s, the African Fish-Eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) population on the lake was the densest in Africa. As a top predator resident in the Kenyan Rift Valley Lakes the African Fish-Eagle is a good indicator of general ecosystem health but is also highly susceptible to toxic effects of pesticide contamination [...] . Globally, most organochlorine pesticides have been banned, but endosulfan, HCH and methoxychlor are widely used in Kenya, while aldrin, dieldrin and lindane are restricted and DDT, endrin, and heptachlor banned. Studies examining residue levels of these harmful chemicals in African Fish-Eagles are limited to small sample sizes examined in the 1970 s and 1980 s.

Unincubated fertile herring gull eggs were collected from an Atlantic coast control site and various Great Lakes sites in 1997 and artificially incubated in the laboratory. Liver and/or kidney tissues from {{approximately half of the}} late-stage embryos were analyzed for the activities of various intermediary metabolic enzymes known to be regulated, at least in part, by corticosteroids. Basal plasma corticosterone concentrations were determined for the remaining embryos. Yolk sacs were collected from each embryo and a subset was analyzed for organochlorine contaminants. Regression analysis of individual yolk sac <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residue</b> concentrations, or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs), with individual basal plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated statistically significant inverse relationships for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs), total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), non-ortho PCBs, and TEQs. Similarly, inverse relationships were observed for the activities of two intermediary metabolic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and malic enzyme) when regressed against PCDDs/PCDFs.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The study {{aimed to}} assess through a {{sentinel}} practice network {{the validity of}} data on levels of organochlorine residues in human milk along with personal, lifestyle, and exposure variables of breastfeeding women; to compare {{the results of this}} new approach with those of the Lower Saxony breast milk surveillance programme; and to test hypotheses on potential determinants of contamination levels. DESIGN [...] Eligible women were enrolled into this cross sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices when bringing their babies for a U 3 infant screening examination (4 th to 6 th week after delivery). Lifestyle and exposure factors were obtained by questionnaire. All milk samples were analysed for hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorbenzole, DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlor; half the samples were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using polychotomous logistic regression (PLR). SETTING [...] The study was conducted in Lower Saxony, Germany, from summer 1992 to summer 1993. PARTICIPANTS [...] Altogether 156 primiparous, breast feeding German women, aged 25 - 35 years, who had been born and had grown up in West Germany, were studied. MAIN RESULTS [...] Compared with the regular programme, participants in this study had their milk analysed sooner after delivery and {{were more likely to have}} grown up in rural areas, less likely to have been exposed to hazardous substances, less likely to have a diet of health food, and slightly less likely to be a smoker at the time of the study. Breast milk contamination levels were comparable in both studies, and in all but two cases well below the tolerable concentrations established by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Fellowship). After adjustment for potential confounders using polychotomous logistic regression, there were statistically significant positive associations between breast milk contamination and age (PCB, test for trend: p = 0. 006), average dietary fat intake per week (dioxin, p = 0. 01), and proximity of residence to hazardous sites (dioxin, p < 0. 05), and negative associations between residue levels and relative body weight at the time of the study (PCB; p < 0. 0001) and difference in body weight (weight minus weight before the pregnancy; PCB, p = 0. 0002), respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] Sentinel practice networks are a feasible and low-biased approach to population based breast milk studies. The contamination levels and associations found are biologically plausible and comparable with the results of other studies. To reduce <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residue</b> levels in human milk in the short term, breast-feeding women should be advised not to try to reduce their weight until after lactation. Public promotion of a lower dietary fat intake may reduce the lifetime accumulation of organochlorine compounds in the human body fat tissue in the long term, resulting in lower concentrations in breast milk as well...|$|E
40|$|AIM The aim of {{the study}} was to assess health hazards posed by {{pesticide}} handling, storage and use on agricultural estates and small farms in Tanzania where coffee, cotton, and other important crops are grown, with a view to developing strategies for the control of pesticide exposure and prevention of pesticide poisoning. METHODS The target population was made up of farmers and other agricultural workers applying pesticides in coffee and cotton farms, as well as of non-agricultural control subjects, health care providers and extension workers in the same areas. -Background data were collected -Focused observations of target farms carried out, -Erythrocyte-acetylcholinesterase and <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residue</b> levels in blood samples determined and -Extensive interviews of agricultural workers, control subjects, health care providers, and extension service workers conducted. RESULTS Background data A total of 104 pesticide chemical names and 179 trade names were compiled in Tanzania. Most of the pesticides were organophosphates, but carbamates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were also represented. The pesticides included aldrin, endosulfan, DDT, dieldrin, camphechlor and lindane, which are either endocrine disruptors or persistent organic pollutants, and were banned or restricted in their countries of origin. Some were classified by World Health Organization as extremely or highly hazardous. For the period 1989 / 90, a total of 736 pesticide-poisoning cases were reported in the Tanzanian in-patient district hospital medical records with more women than men poisoned, however, the medical records were inadequate as they failed to show the cause or type of poisoning. Focused observations More pesticide formulations were used on coffee compared with cotton, and in individually owned compared with cooperative farms. Coffee farms more often displayed unlabeled pesticide containers and missing instructions, while cotton pesticides were stored in bedrooms, near food, and near open fires, and pesticide leftovers were often present. Hazardous practices were more pronounced at the individually owned than the cooperative farms, with significant differences for pesticide storage areas, unlabeled and non-original containers. Acute health effects Assessment of the extent and intensity of organophosphate exposure showed that erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activities during spraying and non-spraying period were comparable. Similarly, the prevalence of cough, headache, abdominal pain, excessive sweating, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting did not differ significantly between spraying and non-spraying periods. There was no suggestion of decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in exposed subjects who complained of organophosphateÂ­related symptoms compared to symptomless exposed subjects. Use of boots, head cover, face cover, and coverall was not significantly associated with acetylcholinesterase activity. Pesticide knowledge and practices in health care and agricultural extension services. Eighty per cent of 104 health care providers interviewed reported to have seen pesticide poisoning, nine having seen two to four cases in the preceding three months. Pesticide poisoning was considered a major problem in the community by 63 % of the health care providers, and a third thought that a number of poisoning cases remained unrecognised. Only one percent of the respondents could identify the group of pesticides predominantly used in the study areas. Only every fourth of the agricultural extension workers perceived pesticides as a major health problem in the community they served. Although high proportion claimed knowledge of first aid procedures in case of pesticide poisoning, many procedures described were not appropriate for the treatment of pesticide poisoning. CONCLUSION Pesticide handling-practices on farms increased the risks of exposure of farm workers and their families to pesticides, thus undermining pesticide safety in many small farms in Tanzania. There was no strong indication for adverse effects of organophosphorus pesticides during the study period, either based on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase or on symptoms. However, a great concern over potential long-term effects arising from the use of pesticides in these areas is eminent because pesticides suspected of long-term adverse effects are being used in hazardous work and living conditions. The extensionists were not aware of the health effects of pesticides and did not know what measures should be taken in case of poisoning. The failure of health care providers to distinguish the pesticide class, e. g. organophosphates and organochlorines, reflects a lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of diagnosis and treatment of pesticide poisoning, and may have a great impact on the prognosis. It also undermines the medical recording system especially for pesticide poisoning incidences. Therefore, pesticide exposures need to be reduced. Health care provides and extensionists need empowerment for prevention and treatment of adverse health effects.

Effects of these contaminants to aquatic river invertebrates were assessed by integrating analyses of metals and <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> in field collected zebra mussels and crayfish {{with a wide range of}} biomarkers. Biological responses included levels of metallothioneins, activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, oxidative stress biomarkers (glutathione content, enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione s-transferase, glutathione peroxidise and glutathione reductase), levels of lipid peroxidation and of DNA strand breaks. The results obtained evidenced similar response patterns in mussels and crayfish with increasing toxic stress levels from upper parts of the river towards the meander located immediately downstream from the most polluted site, close to the waste dumps. The aforementioned stress levels could be related with concentrations of mercury, cadmium, hexachlorobenzene, polychlorobiphenyls and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes from 4 - to 195 -fold greater than local background levels. The response of biomarkers to these pollutant concentrations differences was reflected in high activities and levels of antioxidant enzymes, metallothioneins, lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks and decreased levels of glutathione.

Fourteen (14) different <b>organochlorine</b> pesticides <b>residues</b> namely p,pâ€™-DDT, p,pâ€™-DDE, gamma-HCH, delta-HCH, heptachlor, aldrin, Endrin, endrin-aldehyde, endrin-ketone, alpha-endosulphan, endosulphan-sulphate, gamma-chlordane, dieldrin, and methoxychlor were identified and quantified in the individual breast milk samples using a Gas Chromatograph (GC) with an Electron C apture detector. The GC recoveries of spiked samples were between 89 to 97 %. P,pâ€™- DDE recorded 100 % incidence ratio. Also p,pâ€™-DDT, delta-HCH, gamma-HCH, and endosulfan sulfate recorded incidence ratios of 76. 79, 95. 25, 80. 95 and 85. 71 %, respectively for the breast milk samples. The concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in the human breast milk samples ranged from 1. 839 to 99. 05 :Î¼g/kg fats. With the exception of Endosulphan Sulphate whose mean concentration (99. 052 :Î¼g/kg) was above the Australian Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of 20 :Î¼g/kg for milk, the mean concentrations for all the other organochlorines detected were below their respective limits...|$|R
40|$|Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) {{and common}} carp (Cyprinus carpio) were {{collected}} from 13 sites located in the Mobile (MRB), Apalachicolaâ€“Flintâ€“Chattahoochee (ARB), Savannah (SRB), and Pee Dee (PRB) River Basins to document spatial trends in accumulative chemical contaminants, health indicators, and reproductive biomarkers. <b>Organochlorine</b> <b>residues,</b> 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-like activity (TCDD-EQ), and elemental contaminants were measured in composite samples of whole fish, grouped by species and gender, from each site. Mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were the primary contaminants of concern. Concentrations of Hg in bass samples from all basins exceeded toxicity thresholds for piscivorous mammals (3 Ì†e 0. 1 Î¼g/g ww), juvenile and adult fish (3 Ì†e 0. 2 Î¼g/g ww), and piscivorous birds (3 Ì†e 0. 3 Î¼g/g ww). Total PCB concentrations in samples from the MRB, ARB, and PRB were 3 Ì†e 480 ng/gww and may be a risk to piscivorous wildlife. Selenium concentrations also exceeded toxicity thresholds (3 Ì†e 0. 75 Î¼g/gww) in MRB and ARB fish. Concentrations of other formerly used (total chlordanes, dieldrin, endrin, aldrin, mirex, and hexachlorobenzene) and currently used (pentachlorobenzene, pentachloroanisole, dacthal, endosulfan, Î³-hexachlorocyclohexane, and methoxychlor) <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> were generally low or did not exceed toxicity thresholds for fish and piscivorous wildlife. TCDD-EQs exceeded wildlife dietary guidelines (3 Ì†e 5 pg/g ww) in MRB and PRB fish. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was generally greatest in MRB bass and carp. Altered fish health indicators and reproductive biomarker were noted in individual fish, but mean responses were similar among basins. The field necropsy and histopathological examination determined that MRB fish were generally in poorer health than those from the other basins, primarily due to parasitic infestations. Tumors were found in few fish (n= 5; 0. 01...|$|R
40|$|Induction of the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) {{system has}} {{commonly}} {{been used as}} a biochemical marker of xenobiotic contamination in birds. The present study considers the influence of intrinsic (e. g. sexual cycle) and extrinsic (xenobiotic) factors in determining the levels of MFO activity in a population of Yellow-legged Herring gull (Larus cachinnans). Aldrin epoxidase undergoes marked seasonal variation, reaching a peak in the breeding season; on the other hand 7 -ethoxyresorufin dealkylation activity is more closely related to certain <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> (polychlorinated biphenyls. Lindane, hexachlorobenzene). Seasonal variations in NADPH-and NADH-cytochrome c reductase and NADH-ferricyanide reductase activities were also found. These results suggest that seasonal variations in MFO activity, which {{may be related to the}} sexual cycle, need to be taken into account when considering biochemical effects of pollutants...|$|R
30|$|<b>Organochlorine</b> {{pesticide}} <b>residues</b> {{detected in}} M. senegalensis were aldrin, p,pâ€²-DDE and p,pâ€²-DDD as presented in TableÂ  1. p,pâ€²-DDE recorded the highest mean concentration of 0.263 Â Â±Â  0.033 Â Âµg/g and occurred in 4 of the samples.

30|$|The {{trends of}} <b>organochlorine</b> {{pesticide}} <b>residues</b> {{in the water}} samples analysed decreased with increase in distance away from cocoa farms (0 â€“ 15 Â mÂ >Â  16 â€“ 30 Â mÂ >Â above 30 Â m). The <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> recorded in water samples from the various sites (within the various distance categories to cocoa farms) were below their respective WHO MRLs for drinking water except for alpha-endosulfan at Diabaa (S 2) and Kwakuanya (S 4) at distance 0 â€“ 15 Â m and at Kwakuanya (S 4) at distance 16 â€“ 30 Â m, endosulfan-sulfate at Nkrankwanta (S 1) and Diabaa (S 2) at distance 0 â€“ 15 Â m and heptachlor at Krakrom (S 3) at distance 16 â€“ 30 Â m. The presence of <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in the water samples {{could be due to}} drift during pesticide application, direct overspray, direct spillage, pesticides misuse, improper disposal of left over spray solution, sprayer wash water and pesticide containers, runoff from treated areas or leaching, among others. The concentrations measured however suggest that pesticide residues in hand-dug wells within the various distances do not pose health threats to cocoa farmersâ€™ households except for wells from S 1, S 2, and S 4 at distances 0 â€“ 15 Â m and S 3 and S 4 at distances 16 â€“ 30 Â m which recorded concentrations of some residues above their respective WHO MRL for drinking water.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} serum <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> and risk of gallstone disease. Methods: A 1 : 1, pair-matched, case-control study was designed. Data from 150 patients with gallstones diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography at a single hospital from June 2009 to June 2010 were collected. A total of 150 patients without gallstones {{during the same period}} at the same hospital were recruited as the control group. Capillary gas chromatography was employed to measure the serum concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) residues. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the relative risk of gallstones in relation to <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in serum. Results: The percentages of p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDT in serum of patients were significantly higher than those in serum of controls. The p,p'-DDE, alpha-HCH, and delta-HCH residues in serum of patients were also significantly increased compared with those in serum of controls. Multiple-factor conditional logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT residues were risk factors for gallstone disease. Conclusions: A high level of <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in serum is a potential risk factor for gallstone disease, which suggests that environmental exposure to organochlorine pesticides should be evaluated with respect to gallstone formation.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to analyze <b>organochlorine</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> in the blood samples of the residents of Karachi. Biochemical and hematological parameters were tested thoroughly for changes as a result of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues.</b> In the blood samples which were drawn from both genders, organochlorine compounds like Î± -endosulfan (1. 565 mg/kg) and Î² -endosulfan (1. 233 mg/kg) were found in higher quantities and were the most frequently detected compounds. Average concentrations of the detected compounds (mg/kg) were: HCH (0. 819); Cyclodienes (2. 839); Diphenylaliphatics (0. 240). An evident finding was the alteration in enzyme activity in higher residue samples. Levels of GPT, GOT, ALP, Choline-esterase and Î³ -GT were tested in all samples and observed major shifts in the upper and lower limits in high residue samples as compared with the normal values. Analysis of the blood parameters were carried out thoroughly and checked the levels of TLC, RBC, Hb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelets and differential leucocytes (Neutrophils, Lympho cytes, Eosinophils and Monocytes) but found no distinct changes and hence no convincing relation was observed. Results of the present investigation of OCs in different blood sera indicated that bioconcentration and biomagnification of these chemicals were common phenomena in the population of Karachi city and this may be accountable for a variety of diseases and health hazards. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for estimating total organochlorine pesticide and PCB residue in seal blubber at concentrations of greater than 1 Î¼g g- 1 of lipid is described. Lipid is cleaned up by alumina column chromatography, and the halogen {{concentration of the}} resulting hexane eluace is determined by combustion and microcoulometry. Results {{are similar to those}} obtained by gas chromatographic analysis and can be used to interpolate between results so obtained when data on specific organochlorine compounds is not required for each sample. The <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> recovered in this manner did not constitute all the halogen determined by combustion and microcoulometry of seal lipid. Analysis by the total halogen procedure was 2. 5 tunes faster than the rate achieved with a combination of liquid and gas chromatography operated manually; the requirements for laboratory equipment and space for sample preparation are reduced...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the present study showed that none of the water samples was {{contaminated}} with organochlorine (methoxychlor and DDT) pesticides. These may be the ban of organochlorines from the pesticide markets from 1993 according to the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 due to their high toxicity (Matin et al. 1998). Another study conducted on the presence of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> in water samples from irrigation canals in the Meghna-Dhanogoda irrigation project, Bangladesh, reported that the maximum amount of DDT was 5.7 Â Î¼g/l (Alam et al. 1999), but in the present study, no DDT was detected in water. Matin et al. (1998) also reported that DDT was present in water from irrigated crop field 1.5 Â Î¼g/l in Gaibanda and 19.6 Â Î¼g/l in Begumganj. Golfinopoulos et al. (2003) reported that methoxychlor remains below detection limit in water samples from various lakes at different sampling periods.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that organochlorine pesticide use in the 1950 s and 1960 s caused population declines and local extinctions in two endemic Mauritian birds, the Mauritius kestrel, Falco punctatus, and Mauritius cuckoo-shrike, Coracina typica. This hypothesis was suggested in the 1980 s but is dismissed by authorities in Mauritius. The declines and subsequent increases in the populations and range areas of both species, the timing and location {{of the use of}} organochlorines for malaria control and in food crop production, the diets of the species, and the known mechanisms for transfer of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> into organisms are all consistent with the hypothesis. No alternative explanation can at present account for these population changes. Organochlorine pesticide use cannot therefore be rejected as a reason for the declines and local extinctions of the kestrel and cuckoo-shrike...|$|R
40|$|Two croaker fish species, Pseudotolithus senegalensis and Pseudotolithus typuswere sampled {{seasonally}} from Lagos Lagoon between December 2008 and September 2009 and {{analysed for}} pesticide residues.

The detection and determination of the <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> were performed using gas chromatography. A higher concentration of the pesticide residues was observed during the dry season. There was no particular pattern in the accumulated organochlorine pesticides in the muscle tissues of the fishes. The residue distribution was more in the muscle tissues of Pseudotolithus senegalensis than in Pseudotolithus typus. The levels of OCP were all within permissible limits.

40|$|Introduction Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} malignant disease in women. Exposure to estrogens throughout a woman's life is {{a risk factor for}} the development of breast cancer. Organochlorine compounds (OCCs), such as pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, are persistent lipophilic chemicals identified as endocrine disruptors, mainly with estrogenic effects. To test the hypothesis that the amount and quality of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> in adipose tissue adjacent to breast carcinoma affect the biological behavior of the tumor, we studied biomarker expression in breast carcinoma and the OCC body burden in patients from an urban area adjacent to ParanÃ¡ fluvial system, Argentina. Methods The studied patients were 55 women who had undergone excision biopsies of a breast lesion diagnosed as invasive breast carcinoma. Analysis of OCC residues in breast adipose tissue was conducted by electron-capture gasâ€“liquid chromatography. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±), progesterone receptor (PR) and proliferative activity (Ki- 67) levels were measured in paraffin-embedded biopsies of breast tumors by immunohistochemistry. Results All patients had high levels of organochlorine pesticides in their breast adipose tissue. The most frequently detected compounds were p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene and Î²-hexachlorocyclohexane. When the whole sample was analyzed, no correlation between ERÎ± or PR expression and OCC levels were found. In the subgroup of ERÎ±- positive breast carcinoma patients, however, there was a positive correlation between PR expression (an estrogeninduced protein) in the neoplastic cells and OCC levels in adipose tissue surrounding the tumor. More significantly, all the ERÎ±-positive breast carcinomas from postmenopausal women exhibited high proliferation when organochlorine levels in the surrounding adipose tissue reached levels higher than 2600 ppb. No associations were found between the organochlorine body burden and any other marker of tumor aggressiveness, such as node involvement or tumor size. Conclusion The present results support the hypothesis that <b>organochlorine</b> <b>residues</b> in adipose tissue adjacent to breast carcinoma generate an estrogenic microenvironment that may influence the biological behavior of the tumor through ERÎ± activation and ERÎ±-dependent proliferation. These findings may have therapeutic implications, since interference between organochlorine compounds and hormonal therapy could be expected to occur...|$|R
