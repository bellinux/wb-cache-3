In Europe, the boxes have a triangle {{at the bottom}} corner of the paper sleeve-insert side. The triangle is color-coded to identify the region for which the title is intended and which manual languages are included. The console supports regional lockout (software purchased in a region can be only played on that region's hardware).|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the console {{features}} an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12cm Wii <b>Optical</b> <b>Discs</b> and 8cm Nintendo GameCube Game Discs. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two USB ports are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

25|$|Early on in its history, Nintendo had {{achieved}} considerable success with third-party developer {{support on the}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES). Competition from the Sega Genesis and Sony's PlayStation in the 1990s changed the market's landscape, however, and reduced Nintendo's ability to obtain exclusive, third-party support on the Nintendo 64 (N64). The console's cartridge-based media was also increasing the cost to manufacture software, {{as opposed to the}} cheaper, higher-capacity <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> used by the PlayStation.|$|E
5000|$|Use of <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> {{recorders}} require <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> authoring software, {{sometimes called}} [...] "burning applications" [...] or [...] "burner applications". Such software is usually sold with the recorder. Some operating systems come bundled with them.|$|R

50|$|Blu-ray Disc Recordable (or BD-R) {{refers to}} two direct to <b>disc</b> <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> {{recording}} technologies {{that can be}} recorded on to an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> with an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> recorder. BD-R discs can be written to once, whereas BD-RE (Blu-ray Disc Recordable Erasable) can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. Disc capacities are 25 GB for single-layer discs, 50 GB for double-layer discs, 100 GB for triple-layer, and 128 GB for quadruple-layer (in BD-R only).|$|R
25|$|Optical {{storage devices}} {{are among the}} {{cheapest}} methods of mass data storage after the hard drive. They are slower than their flash-based counterparts. Standard 12cm <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> are larger than flash drives and more subject to damage. Smaller optical media do exist, such as business card CD-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 8cm recordable MiniCD and MiniDVD. The small discs are {{more expensive than the}} standard size, and do not work in all drives.|$|E
25|$|The GameCube is {{the first}} Nintendo console to use <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> as its primary storage medium. The discs {{are similar to the}} miniDVD format; {{as a result of their}} smaller size and the console's small disc compartment, the system was not {{designed}} to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. The console supports online gaming for a small number of its titles via the broadband or modem adapter and connects to the Game Boy Advance via the link cable, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.|$|E
25|$|The GameCube (officially called Nintendo GameCube, {{abbreviated}} NGC in Japan and GCN in North America) {{was released}} in 2001, in Japan and North America, and in 2002 worldwide. The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64 and competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sega's Dreamcast. The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> as its primary storage medium. The discs {{are similar to the}} miniDVD format, but the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. Nintendo introduced a variety of connectivity options for the GameCube. The GameCube's game library has sparse support for Internet gaming, a feature that requires the use of the aftermarket Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter. The GameCube supports connectivity to the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.|$|E

50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>disc</b> authoring, {{including}} DVD and Blu-ray Disc authoring is {{the process}} of assembling source material - video, audio or other data - into the proper logical volume format to then be recorded ("burned") onto an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> (typically a compact disc or DVD).|$|R
50|$|The first {{erasable}} <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> drives {{were announced}} in 1983, by Matsushita (Panasonic), Sony, and Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDDI).

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free, allowing {{players to}} use cartridges or downloaded content from {{any part of}} the world, though Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed. Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, they have access to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device. The Switch does not support <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> and is not backwards compatible with the 3DS and Wii U game media. The Switch is not backwards compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles. The console also did not launch with the Virtual Console, which provided digital versions of physically released games from past Nintendo consoles, but the company said this feature may be added later. Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles, but currently does not support controllers or controller emulation for these titles.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time, akin to that of Star Wars in the movie industry. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore, much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter fills up by taking hits from opponents. The materia system is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the slotted item system in Diablo II (2000). Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline, and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs. The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time.|$|E
500|$|Varying {{compositions}} of GeSbTe ("GST alloys") and Ag- and In- doped Sb2Te ("AIST alloys"), being {{examples of}} phase-change materials, {{are widely used}} in rewritable <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> and phase-change memory devices. By applying heat, they can be switched between amorphous (glassy) and crystalline states. The change in optical and electrical properties {{can be used for}} information storage purposes. Future applications for GeSbTe may include, [...] "ultrafast, entirely solid-state displays with nanometre-scale pixels, semi-transparent 'smart' glasses, 'smart' contact lenses and artificial retina devices." ...|$|E
5000|$|ISO {{images are}} {{another type of}} <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> image files, which {{commonly}} use the [...] file extension, but sometimes use the [...] file extension as well. They {{are similar to the}} raw <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> images, but contain only one track with computer data obtained from an <b>optical</b> <b>disc.</b> They can not contain multiple tracks, nor audio or video tracks. They also do not contain the control headers and error correction fields of CD-ROM or DVD sectors that raw disc images usually store. Their internal format follows the structure of an <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> file system, commonly ISO 9660 (for CDs) or UDF (for DVDs). The CUE/BIN and CCD/IMG formats, which usually contain raw disc images, can also store ISO images instead.|$|R
5000|$|An ISO {{image is}} an archive file of an <b>optical</b> <b>disc,</b> {{a type of}} disk image {{composed}} of the data contents from every written sector on an <b>optical</b> <b>disc,</b> including the <b>optical</b> <b>disc</b> file system. ISO image files usually have a file extension of [...]iso. The name ISO is taken from the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media, but {{what is known as}} an ISO image might also contain a UDF (ISO/IEC 13346) file system (commonly used by DVDs and Blu-ray Discs).|$|R

500|$|In late 2011, Nintendo {{released}} a reconfigured model, the [...] "Wii Family Edition", which lacks Nintendo GameCube compatibility; this model was not released in Japan. The Wii Mini, Nintendo's first major console redesign since the compact SNES, succeeded the standard Wii model {{and was released}} first in Canada on December 7, 2012. The Wii Mini can only play Wii <b>optical</b> <b>discs,</b> as it omits GameCube compatibility and all networking capabilities; this model was not released in Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. The Wii's successor, the Wii U, was released on November 18, 2012. On October 20, 2013, Nintendo confirmed it had discontinued production of the Wii in Japan and Europe, although the Wii Mini is still in production and available in Europe.|$|E
500|$|With the {{exception}} of the game's critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 port, most later releases of Resident Evil 2 have received slightly lower scores than the PlayStation version. Weigand advised players who already owned Resident Evil 2 to rent the Dual Shock Ver. for the [...] "Extreme Battle" [...] minigame, and recommended that newcomers buy the updated edition instead of the original release. The Windows port was praised for its additional content, but criticized for not allowing the player to save at will, and for lacking updated backgrounds to fit the higher in-game resolution. The Nintendo 64 version was widely commended for the technical achievement of fitting a two-disc game on a single 512-Mbit (64MB) cartridge. However, Taylor criticized the game for retaining scenes from the PlayStation version that were used to conceal loading times– a technical disadvantage of <b>optical</b> <b>discs</b> that cartridges do not share. A GamePro writer under the pseudonym [...] "The Freshman" [...] was impressed with the enhanced graphics of the Nintendo 64 port, but was disappointed by its heavily compressed CG FMVs. GameSpot's Joe Fielder found the compression to be forgivable given the cartridge format, and noted that the new exclusive features made up for the lack of the [...] "Extreme Battle" [...] mode. IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina applauded the implementation of Dolby Surround support, and called the Nintendo 64 release the [...] "best version of the game".|$|E
