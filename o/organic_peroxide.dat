25|$|Acetone {{peroxide}} is an <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> and {{a primary}} high explosive. It {{is produced by}} the oxidation of acetone to yield a mixture of linear monomer and cyclic dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms. The trimer is known as triacetone triperoxide (TATP) or tri-cyclic acetone peroxide (TCAP). Acetone peroxide {{takes the form of}} a white crystalline powder with a distinctive bleach-like odor and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, or shock. As a non-nitrogenous explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several terrorist attacks since 2001.|$|E
50|$|Organic {{peroxides}} {{are often}} sold as formulations that include {{one or more}} phlegmatizing agents. That is, for safety sake or performance benefits the properties of an <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> formulation are commonly modified {{by the use of}} additives to phlegmatize (desensitize), stabilize, or otherwise enhance the <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> for commercial use. Commercial formulations occasionally consist of mixtures of organic peroxides, {{which may or may not}} be phlegmatized.|$|E

50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> {{may be in}} {{the solid}} or liquid state. There are no <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> in the vapor state.

50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> are <b>organic</b> {{compounds}} {{containing the}} peroxide functional group (ROOR′). If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals {{of the form}} RO•. Thus, <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process {{has been used in}} explosives. <b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides,</b> like their inorganic counterparts, are powerful bleaching agents.|$|R

50|$|Bicycloundecane is anisotropically conductive. It is one {{of several}} bridged {{hydrocarbon}} residues that are formed during the thermohardening of polymerizable conductive adhesives based on di(metha)acroyloxymethyl-tricyclodecane, <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and thermoplastic resin; such adhesives have applications in electronics.|$|E
50|$|The SADT for an <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{formulation}} {{is usually}} lower for more concentrated formulations. Dilution with a compatible, high boiling point diluent will usually increase the SADT since the peroxide is dilute and the diluent can absorb {{much of the}} heat minimizing the increase in temperature. Also, for an <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> formulation, larger packages generally have a lower SADT because of the poorer heat transfer of the larger package due to lower surface area to volume ratio. Most organic peroxides react to some extent with their decomposition products during thermal decomposition. This often increases the rate since the decomposition proceeds more rapidly as the decomposition products are generated.|$|E

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{analytical system}} for the separation and detection of <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides,</b> based on a microchip capillary electrophoresis device with an integrated amperometric detector, was developed. The new microsystem relies on the reductive detection of both <b>organic</b> acid <b>peroxides</b> and hydroperoxides at - 700 mV (vs. Ag wire/AgCl). Factors influencing the separation and detection processes were examined and optimized. The integrated microsystem offers rapid measurements (within 130 s) of these organic-peroxide compounds, down to micromolar levels. A highly stable response for repetitive injections (RSD 0. 35 - 3. 12 %; n = 12) reflects the negligible electrode passivation.

5000|$|As they combine unstably bound oxygen {{together}} with hydrogen and carbon {{in the same}} molecule, <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> ignite easily and burn rapidly and intensely. The same applies to organic materials contaminated with <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides.</b> Since peroxides can form spontaneously in some materials, some caution must be exercised with such [...] "peroxide forming materials", such as the common ethers diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Acetone peroxide, a powerful explosive, is an unwanted and dangerous byproduct of several chemical reactions, ranging from synthesis of MDMA (where it is a by-product of isosafrole oxidation in acetone) to industrial production of phenol (where the second product of the cumene process, acetone, is partially oxidized to peroxide on the second reaction step). Accidental preparation of <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> can occur by mixing ketone solvents (most commonly acetone) with waste materials containing hydrogen peroxide or other oxidizers and leaving the mixture standing for several hours.|$|R
