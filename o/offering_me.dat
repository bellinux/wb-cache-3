Largely considered her come-back album, Carey's tenth studio effort The Emancipation of Mimi (2005) revived faith in the singer's stock, with single [...] "We Belong Together" [...] becoming her strongest international showing in years, and topping the chart in the US for 14-weeks and breaking several radio airplay records. In 2010, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] was listed by Billboard as the most successful song of the decade. In 2008, [...] "Touch My Body", the debut single from her album E=MC², became Carey's 18th chart-topper on the Hot 100, making her the solo artist with the most number ones in the charts history. Since Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009), Carey has released a string of moderate to unsuccessful singles following into the release of her most recent <b>offering,</b> <b>Me.</b> I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse (2014). As of 2009, Carey has sold 17.2 million physical singles and 13.8 million digital tracks in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Throughout her career, the singer has spent a record 79 weeks at the number one position on the Hot 100, becoming the artist with the most weeks at number one in US history. Overall, she has 24 top-ten singles in the UK and 27 top-ten songs on the US chart, placing her in fifth place for the most top tens since its inception.|$|E

He later remarked that [...] "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was <b>offering</b> <b>me</b> things." [...] It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to Lance Parkin, [...] "the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and {{it was clear that the}} audience was sticking with the title as they grew up.

The following week, the Greens, who had polled 11.5% of the vote at the 1995 election, had suggested they may not preference Mooney due to his pro-development stance and previous clashes with the environmental movement, especially over the Nelly Bay resort development on Magnetic Island, and Davies, who was directing all calls to the Sydney promoter Harry M.
