The CAT is strongest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E

25|$|During flight, heat {{generated}} by equipment mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> plates was dissipated to space by a sublimation heat exchanger. Water from a reservoir (water accumulator) {{was exposed to}} the low temperature and pressure environment of space, where it first freezes and then sublimates, taking heat from the heat exchanger and transferring it to the water molecules which escape to space in gaseous state. Water/methanol was cooled by circulation through the heat exchanger.|$|E
25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid {{exhaled air}} {{condenses}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> {{inside of the}} faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E

25|$|What Hill did {{not learn}} was {{his role in the}} {{upcoming}} battle. The courier sent with written orders was not able to find Hill and returned to his unit without informing anyone. Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, one of Hill's division commanders, was at Polk's headquarters, but was not informed that his division was to initiate the dawn attack. At 5 a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6 a.m. Hill responded with a number of reasons for delaying the attack, including readjustments of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men. Reluctantly, Bragg agreed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} game We the People {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much like a typical board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer card driven games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games. Twilight Struggle, a game based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, was ranked #1 on the website BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016. As of April 2017, it's ranked third.|$|E
25|$|After his 1911 {{marriage}} he and {{his wife}} purchased land north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at Cold Springs. It was a large tract of land. Mulford and Fridel lived in a multi-story home with the basement and an outbuilding devoted to his snakes. It was remote, connected to services only by a train with a depot near their house and walking path. He had plans of refurbishing one of the old farmhouses on the property although this never transpired. According to historians the farmhouse likely burned down sometime in 1919 and the family left Cold Springs sometime after this. During his years at Cold Springs Mulford kept busy on the property developing the former hotel grounds, growing an orchard, raising fruits and vegetables, his reptiles and squab as well as involved in some fashion with the bottling and selling of the spring water which came from underground sources. In Mulford's time, the collected spring water and squab would eventually find their way to tables as far away as Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Additional information has been collected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> Springs inhabitants of the early 1900s including the Fosters and {{can be found in the}} book Cold Spring Hotel Site.|$|E

25|$|The {{repeated}} {{intrusion of}} the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the Middle Age near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, {{also known as the}} Sella del Diavolo ("Saddle of the Devil") for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpeddì) and west (the mountains of Capoterra). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of Gennargentu {{can be seen from the}} highest points of the city.|$|E

[...] "Post-revisionists" [...] see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.

[...] He points out inferences to the Cold War, noting that the spy Sakov in [...] "The Cure" [...] is Russian and concluding that The Secret Service {{is one of several}} Century 21 series that [...] "unashamedly capitalised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown."

500|$|After Rothbard's {{death in}} 1995 Lew Rockwell, President of the von Mises Institute, told The New York Times that Rothbard was [...] "the founder of right-wing anarchism". William F.

The Ludwig von Mises Institute published Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam which included memorials from 31 individuals, including libertarians and academics.
