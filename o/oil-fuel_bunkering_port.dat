40|$|For a port {{to be able}} {{to compete}} it needs to offer more than a berth. Bunkering is such a service. Bunkers are a major cost for {{shipping}} companies, because of this the selection of <b>bunkering</b> <b>port</b> is an important decision. The availability of bunker on the global market is abundant and the competitiveness between ports and suppliers are fierce. The purpose of this report is to determine the underlying factors of a shipping company’s choice of <b>bunkering</b> <b>port,</b> as well as to present suggestions on how the Port of Gothenburg can develop their competitiveness in bunkering services. This study focuses on two questions: How is the competitiveness among <b>bunkering</b> <b>ports</b> surrounding the Gothenburg region? How can the port of Gothenburg work to develop a competitive <b>bunker</b> <b>port?</b> The report is based on a case study with interviews with several stakeholders within the bunker market in the Gothenburg region. The case study is based on earlier research about the competitiveness on the bunker market as well as port selection criteria. Statistic data for the Gothenburg region trade has also been collected. The authors find that the port of Gothenburg is a competitive port, additionally the port possesses good possibilities to increase its competitiveness as a <b>bunker</b> <b>port,</b> mainly because of its geographical position and the closeness to refineries. The port is however lacking some bunkering services infrastructure to actually compete with the largest <b>bunkering</b> <b>ports</b> in the world. The most important competitive factor is the price of bunker, in which the port of Gothenburg is not in a leading position, although there is a good availability and quality in the bunkering services offered in the port. The authors find that an increase of internal competition would raise the total competitiveness as a <b>bunker</b> <b>port...</b>|$|R

30|$|Also Wang et al. (2014) {{analysed}} the bunkering {{strategy for}} the liner shipping industry. In their research, a benchmarking framework was developed that evaluates bunkering ports’ performances in regular liner routes in order to choose optimal ones. The authors argue that <b>bunkering</b> <b>port</b> selection is typically a multi-criteria group decision problem, and in many practical situations, decision makers cannot form proper judgments using incomplete and uncertain information in an environment with exact and crisp values. Therefore, a fuzzy numbers approach was proposed in their research. In the developed benchmark, key performance factors (KPFs) of <b>bunkering</b> <b>ports</b> are identified. The highest ranking parameters, out of 15, are: bunker price, bunker quality, and safety of the bunkering. These bunker performance factors where obtained via a questionnaire with decision makers from selected liner shipping companies. Secondly, the authors applied the developed framework to a case study for a container loop between China, Korea and Japan.|$|R

30|$|In Yao et al. (2012), {{a bunker}} fuel {{management}} strategy is studied {{for a single}} shipping liner service. The research includes <b>bunkering</b> <b>port</b> selection (where to bunker), bunkering amounts and ship speed adjustment. The main reason to take all these elements into account is that these three components are interrelated. In the research, a theoretical model is developed on which an optimization of the three above-mentioned parameters is performed. The optimization in their research is done based on the fuel cost and {{does not take into}} account which parameters might affect the decision to bunker at a certain port.|$|R

30|$|If the Kra Canal {{is going}} to be realised, Malaysia needs {{to find a way to}} benefit from the canal. Diversification of {{maritime}} business by investing in regionally strategic areas, such as Langkawi in Kedah, Padang Besar in Perlis, Penang Port, Tok Bali in Kelantan, or even in neighbouring countries, including Thailand and Myammar, appears to have the potential to increase market share despite the trade route shift. Nationally, there are three potential strategies that can be implemented in the future, which are the enhancement of the Penang Port as the hub port of Malaysia; the development of an inland depot at Padang Besar, Perlis; and the establishment of Tok Bali as a <b>bunkering</b> <b>port</b> in Kelantan.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the consequences of}} LNG usage as a marine fuel. The restrictions of harmful substances emission to atmosphere from marine engines, especially in controlled emission areas (ECA and SECA areas) of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, forces the engine makers to use additional installations, which operation may fulfill the purification requirements of exhaust gases. The option is a usage gaseous fuels, especially liquid natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG). There is no an alternative – only gaseous fuels may fulfill the Tier 3 level without exhaust gases purification process. In prognosis about 650 ships (in high scenario about 2000) will be fuelled LNG in the year 2025. It was written why the liquid fuels stay unattractive. The basic problem is still the limited network of LNG distribution in ports {{and the lack of}} small vessels or barges for LNG bunkering. The proposition of design of LNG tank and barges were presented. The next problem is a deficiency of LNG <b>bunker</b> <b>port</b> in deep sea before entering the ECA areas. The controlled emission areas will extend in the near future. The LNG or CNG seemed to be the preferring fuel in industry due to CO 2 emission limits and environmental taxes. The demand for LNG in prognosis to 2025 in <b>bunker</b> <b>ports</b> varies 0. 1 - 18 % of total fuel bunker depending on legislation and low or high case, in base case it will be 3 %. It depends on the conviction of ship-owners that is no return from transition to the LNG or CNG ship fuelling. The examples to LNG ship conversion were described...|$|R
50|$|On 19 February 1706, Queen Anne (1665-1714) of Great Britain granted Free Port {{status to}} Gibraltar. However, {{in the early}} 18th century, Gibraltar was principally a garrison; the amount of {{commerce}} was negligible. Following the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, Gibraltar was established as a port for international trade. 1823 marked {{the appearance of the}} first steamship in Gibraltar and its gradual evolution to a <b>bunkering</b> <b>port.</b> The government-administered Gibraltar Port Authority was founded in 1806 and its successor, the independent Gibraltar Port Authority (GPA), was established in 2005 by the Gibraltar Port Authority Act. The Act of Parliament also provided for the transfer of some responsibilities from the Government of Gibraltar to the Authority. While established in 2005, the independent Gibraltar Port Authority was not constituted until 2006. Members of the Authority were appointed, effective 1 June 2006.|$|R
30|$|The idea of {{developing}} the Kra Canal is most welcome by shipping practitioners because of the substantial amount of cost savings, its high level of safety and security, and reduction in journey distance of vessels. Consequently, the maritime business activity at the Malacca Strait may be significantly affected {{and there will be}} the reshaping of the economies because of the new accessible sea route. Therefore, the contributions of this research are: 1) identification of the possible changes in maritime business patterns in Malaysia, and 2) determining the positive and negative implications with the use of 7 elements in a PESTLES analysis. These seven factors are aggregated to propose a future maritime business strategy in Malaysia that can generate revenue that would boost the maritime economy, for instance: 1) diversification by maritime businesses who could invest in regionally strategic areas, 2) development of the Tok Bali area as a <b>bunker</b> <b>port</b> to offer <b>bunkering</b> services, and 3) promotion of the Penang Port as the hub port of Malaysia. These strategies can reshape the Malaysian economy.|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} research, we {{forecast}} LNG <b>bunker</b> demand at <b>port</b> level starting from current bunker volumes per shipping segment. Our approach {{does not take}} into account fuel consumption of future vessels calling at the port under consideration; should ships become more fuel-efficient, they will obviously require less bunker fuel. Secondly, we assume the number of ships calling at a given port to remain constant. Obviously, any significant increase or, as the case may be, decrease in port calls will also affect demand for bunker in general and for LNG specifically. Another limitation of our approach is that obtaining the <b>port</b> <b>bunkering</b> data required for forecasting can be time-consuming.|$|R

40|$|Neville Cunningham (1927 - 2013) is an {{important}} part of a long history of radical Newcastle. He lived for 35 years in Lewis Street, Islington, in an old worker's cottage, recognisable to many by the large Ned Kelly print confronting visitors in the front window. Nev was associated with the town from his young days as a seaman on the steamers, sailing up and down the coast using Newcastle as a coal <b>bunkering</b> <b>port.</b> He was actively involved in the Newcastle Folk Club, and numerous political issues: peace marches, celebrating Nelson Mandela's victory, the H Block committee. He even ran for Lord Mayor in the 1980 s. In recent years he was well known for 'The Beehive' - a double garage built in his backyard that was a venue for social, political and cultural activities, including folk music sessions, mini-concerts, fundraisers, poetry readings, and choreographing political activism. Nev was arrested a number of times, and spent a few nights in the cooler, for political activities ranging from fighting to posting bills, the last infringement protesting against the 1971 Springbok (rugby union) tour of Australia...|$|R
30|$|The guiding {{principle}} {{relies on the}} idea that the tax levy takes into account the variance in the CO 2 emitted from various fuel types. The levy can be paid through refineries, vessels, <b>bunker</b> stations, <b>port</b> authorities, or any other combination (further details of the payment mechanism can be found in GHG-WG 1 / 5 / 1 report). Moreover, establishment and operation of the ICF will require the establishment of an organization that will track the purchase of fuel and GHG emitted for every existing vessel.|$|R
30|$|However, if ship {{owners are}} {{to switch to}} LNG, ports must provide the {{necessary}} LNG <b>bunker</b> infrastructure. <b>Port</b> authorities, for their part, can only invest meaningfully in such facilities {{if they have a}} rough idea of potential demand for LNG bunker from deep-sea, shortsea and inland navigation, as LNG is increasingly substituted for Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and/or Marine Gas Oil (MGO). This paper proposes a generic forecasting method for LNG demand at port level, and applies it to the case of Antwerp. Potential demand for LNG bunker may provide a basis for strategic longer-term planning and project development aimed at the promotion of LNG as a ship fuel.|$|R

However, the demand for bunker has outpaced the supply of infrastructure needed for bunkering in recent years.|$|R
30|$|Technological {{changes in}} ship {{propulsion}} also result in changes in <b>bunkering</b> requirements at <b>ports</b> of call.

30|$|Wang and Notteboom (2015) {{consider}} current port {{practices in}} the development of LNG bunkering facilities in eight ports in Northern Europe. They identify the important role of the evolving port function beyond the traditional model in promoting innovation.

In order for such an authority to be able to determine the required capacity of LNG bunkering installations, it would need an LNG <b>bunker</b> forecast at <b>port</b> level.|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} used for estimating the bunkering volumes {{in the port}} of Antwerp comprises four steps. It is assumed that the Customs data is complete and includes all fuel <b>bunkered</b> in the <b>port.</b> The <b>bunkering</b> data, however, is more detailed, but includes {{only a part of}} the volume that is covered in the Customs dataset. Both datasets include the volumes bunkered per company. Therefore, as a first step in the estimation approach, the factors that show under or overreporting are calculated by balancing PoA data and Belgian Customs Office data.|$|R
30|$|The present paper {{develops}} a forecasting method for determining potential LNG <b>bunker</b> volumes at <b>port</b> level. The proposed method {{is based on}} a review of the literature, historical data on technological innovation in shipping (i.e. the transitions from sail to steam and marine diesel engines), expert opinions and present-day bunker volumes. The forecast obtained was subsequently validated by shipping companies, bunker companies and fuel suppliers operating in the port of Antwerp. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} a number of relevant independent variables on the forecast.|$|R
