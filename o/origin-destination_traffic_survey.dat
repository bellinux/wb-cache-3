40|$|There is {{a widely}} held notion in the {{literature}} {{that there is an}} <b>origin-destination</b> <b>traffic</b> matrix for all the hosts (end nodes) that are attached to any switched local area network. This is usually in relation to the need to calculate the end-to-end (or maximum end-to-end) delays between all the end nodes that are attached to the network, {{for the sole purpose of}} using these delays values to design upper-bounded delay switched local area networks, in efforts at solving the delay problems of this class of networks.

40|$|Understanding urban {{population}} migration patterns is very helpful for urban operation and management, in-cluding the traffic forecasting, epidemic prevention, com-mercial resource allocation, emergency response and fu-ture urban planning. The large taxi fleet equipped with GPS comprises ubiquitous mobile probes in urban ar-eas, and their trajectories reveal interesting phenomena in the city. We investigate the {{urban population}} migra-tion pattern mining based on taxi trajectories, including 1) the hotzone identification and 2) the principal <b>Origin-Destination</b> <b>traffic</b> flow (OD pair) extraction. We show {{how to apply}} state-of-art point clustering algorithms to address these two tasks.

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} computer communications networks {{give rise to a}} variety of interesting statistical problems. This paper focuses on network tomography, a term used to characterize two classes of large-scale inverse problems. The first deals with passive tomography where aggregate data are collected at the individual router/node level and the goal is to recover path-level information. The main problem of interest here is the estimation of the <b>origin-destination</b> <b>traffic</b> matrix. The second, referred to as active tomography, deals with reconstructing link-level information from end-to-end path-level measurements obtained by actively probing the network. The primary application in this case is estimation of quality-of-service parameters such as loss rates and delay distributions. The paper provides a review of the statistical issues and developments in network tomography with an emphasis on active tomography. An application to Internet telephony is used to illustrate the results...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case study on an {{iterative}} method of traffic matrix estimation under some simplifying assumptions about {{the distribution of the}} <b>origin-destination</b> <b>traffic</b> demands. The starting point of our work is the Vaton-Gravey iterative Bayesian method, but {{there are quite a few}} differences between that method and our consideration. It is assumed that the distribution of the demands follow a single Gaussian distribution instead of being a modulated process. The normality assumption allows us to bypass the Markov Chain Monte Carlo step in the iterative method and explicitly derive the expected values for mean and covariance matrix of the traffic demands conditioned on link counts. We show that under the assumption of single underlying distribution the expected values of the mean and covariance converge after the first step of the iteration. This method cannot improve on this if no relation between mean and variance is imposed in order to make use of the covariance matrix estimates, or the distribution is assumed to be modulated from a regime of distributions. ...|$|R

40|$|The way {{passenger}} traffic is distributed at multiple airport systems continues to intrigue air transportation planners, urban planners, and policy-makers as researchers attempt to unravel how airlines, air travelers and airports {{relate to each}} other. While previous research efforts have typically concentrated on the air travelers' choice of airports, the current thesis addresses how the competitive behavior of airlines operating in a deregulated environment influences the air traveler's choice of airports and the resulting distribution of {{passenger traffic}} in the multiple airport system. The methodology of the research first involves identifying four scenarios under which airlines compete in multiple airport environments, after which an anecdotal analysis of a select number of city-pair markets for each scenario was performed to solicit supporting evidence of competitive behavior of airlines. To keep the preliminary investigation simple, the author has chosen to study the dual-airport systems at Chicago and Houston. Owing to limitations of the data from O&DPlus and ONBOARD, the author used a strict set of criteria to identify 14 city-pair markets to analyze the response of passengers and airlines to challengers entering the city-pair markets between 1984 and 1993. The six quantitative indicators used in the anecdotal analyses include: average fares, average number of nonstop departures per day each way, quarterly origindestination traffic, quarterly non-origin-destination traffic, average quarterly load factors, and the quarterly total airport-to-airport <b>origin-destination</b> <b>traffic.</b> The results of the research indicate that while competition is evident, a general trend of competitive behavior of the airlines in the multiple airport environment is not discernible. The entry of a challenger typically elicits a variety of responses. Significant stimulation of the <b>origin-destination</b> <b>traffic</b> was observed in cases where low-fare carriers entered the market. The fact {{that the number of}} non-origin-destination passengers usually exceeds the number of origin-destination passengers may indicate that justification for the service in the airport-pairs examined goes beyond simply satisfying the demand for travel in the origin-destination market. Although quantitative modeling techniques were not used in this study, the author believes that future researchers should contend with the complex, multi-dimensional nature of airline competition before attempting to accurately model the competitive behavior of airlines at multiple airport systems.
