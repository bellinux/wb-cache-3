The article discusses a number of concepts of equity, examines three specific <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rules and formulae, and presents cost calculations on the <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rules. The three formulae that are explored have some ability to adapt to national circumstances, but none of them creates a <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement that completely equalizes the national income losses as percentage of GDP across the OECD.

A broader security burden-sharing measure is devised and tested; based on this broader measure, there is still no disproportionality evident in the recent past. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War in 1990 was {{followed}} by a shift from a bipolar to a unipolar world, profoundly transforming the nature of international alliance politics. Then, what are the systemic features of the unipolar system that have changed alliance relations in comparison to the previous bipolar and multipolar world? How can we explain the diverse reaction of the U. S. allies in different regions in response to the U. S. request for the modification of alliance functions and reshaping of the alliance <b>burden</b> <b>sharing?</b> How do we measure and interpret changes in the nature of alliance politics in a unipolar system? The goal of this project is to provide a systematic answer to these questions. Focusing on international system polarities and alliance <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior, this dissertation builds a framework for understanding the dynamics of alliance politics. In particular, I argue that alliance <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> as an empirical indicator plays a critical role in explaining the changed nature of the unipolar alliance system. First, I examine how the two interrelated systemic factors - external threat and the distribution of power - influence alliance <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> with a system-level analysis by utilizing a quantitative method with state-year <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> data from 1885 to 2000. Second, I present case studies of South Korea and Japan 2 ̆ 7 s alliance <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> in the post-Cold War period. A central argument of the dissertation is that the role and function of alliance is determined by structural constraints of different international system polarities. Specifically, this project demonstrates that <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> is a key factor representing the impact of systemic properties of unipolarity on the behavioral changes in alliance politics...|$|R

In a national setting, the implementation of an optimal policy is relatively straightforward. But in a cross-border setting, one is confronted with possible coordination failure. Using a multicountry model, it is shown that ex post negotiations on <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> lead to an underprovision of recapitalizations. Next, we explore different ex ante <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms to overcome the coordination failure. The first is a general scheme financed collectively by the participating countries (generic <b>burden</b> <b>sharing).</b> The second relates the burden {{to the location of}} the assets of the bank to be recapitalized (specific <b>burden</b> <b>sharing).</b> The working of the two mechanisms is calibrated with data on large cross border banks in Europe.

The developed scenarios confirmed the result of previous studies that emissions can be significantly reduced while satisfying the rising demand for energy due to technological alternatives with lower emissions. A combination of biofuels, wind, hydro and nuclear power would allow substantial emission reductions in the electricity sector, while a switch from fossil to biofuels could be expected in industrial and transportation sectors.

40|$|Dividing {{the burden}} for {{greenhouse}} gas abatement amongst the provinces has proven challenging in Canada, {{and is a}} major factor contributing to Canada's poor historic performance on greenhouse gas abatement. As the country aims to achieve substantial cuts to emissions over the next decade and by mid-century, such <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> considerations are likely to be elevated in importance. This paper uses a calibrated multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium model to compare a number of archetypal rules for <b>sharing</b> the <b>burden</b> of a joint commitment amongst members for the case of greenhouse gas reductions in Canada. Because of the substantial heterogeneity amongst Canadian provinces, these different <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rules imply signifcantly different relative abatement effort amongst provinces, and also signifcantly different welfare implications. When emission permits are allocated on an equal per capita basis, welfare is increased in Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Manitoba, and signifcantly reduced in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In contrast, when emission permits are allocated based on historic emissions, Alberta and Saskatchewan are made better off, and Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Manitoba are made worse off. We compare these archetypal <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rules to existing provincial emission reduction commitments, and find that none of the standard <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rules comes close to existing commitments. We argue that the debate on <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> of greenhouse gas abatement in Canada could be objectified if informed by coherent quantitative analysis such as the one presented here...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} two {{alternatives to}} inaction for governments combating terrorism, which we term Defense and Prevention. Defense consists {{of investing in}} resources that reduce the impact of an attack, and generates a negative externality to other governments, making their countries a more attractive objective for terrorists. In contrast, Prevention, which consists of investing in resources that reduce {{the ability of the}} terrorist organization to mount an attack, creates a positive externality by reducing the overall threat of terrorism for all. This interaction is captured using a simple 3 × 3 “Nested Prisoner’s Dilemma” game, with a single Nash equilibrium where both countries choose Defense. Due to the structure of this interaction, countries can benefit from coordination of policy choices, and international institutions (such as the UN) can be utilized to facilitate coordination by implementing agreements to <b>share</b> the <b>burden</b> of Prevention. We introduce an institution that implements a burden-sharing policy for Prevention, and investigate experimentally whether subjects coordinate on a cooperative strategy more frequently under different levels of cost sharing. In all treatments, <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> leaves the Prisoner’s Dilemma structure and Nash equilibrium of the game unchanged.

Fair burden-sharing focused on preventing the Communist expansion throughout the Cold War. After the Cold War focus of discussions shifted toward providing money and troops for the crisis management, security building, peace support operations, and war against terrorism. This article argues that <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> problem in NATO has two major dimensions; (1) every member country struggles to shift some of the burden it carries to others, (2) decisions are made according to the extent of the contribution to the alliance. Since the United States is undoubtedly the major contributor by far, American efforts of shifting some burden to other members and European reaction to American hegemony in the decision making processes are two major elements engendering crises in the organization. These two major consequences of <b>burden</b> <b>sharing</b> rivalries are affected by both international and domestic constraints as well as personalities...|$|R
