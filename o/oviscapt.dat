40|$|Abstract Drosophila butantan sp. nov., {{a species}} {{belonging}} to the guarani group and closely related to Drosophila nigrifemur from Bolivia, is described based on a female, {{and some of its}} offspring, collected at the forest reserve of the Instituto de Biociências da Universidade de São Paulo, Cidade Universitária "Armando de Salles Oliveira", São Paulo City, state of São Paulo, Brazil. Although externally similar, the two apparently forest-dwelling species can be told apart by having distinct <b>oviscapt</b> valves and spermathecal introverts and tips. Accordingly, a proposal is made to also include D. nigrifemur, a previously unassigned species, in the guarani group. The two species seem to be also related to Drosophila alexandrei and Drosophila guaraja as indicated by their external morphology, their elongate spermathecae and the not so sharply pointed <b>oviscapt</b> valves. The karyotypes of the new species differ from those described for D. alexandrei and D. guaraja, while those of D. nigrifemur remain still unknown.

40|$|The Pegomya meridiana species {{group is}} {{established}} for three Palaearctic species that supposedly all as larvae attack seed-capsules of Hypericum spp. (Clusiaceae). Pegomya meridiana (Villeneuve) and P. provecta (Villeneuve) are widespread Eurasian species, while the third species, P. canariensis Michelsen, is endemic {{to the western}} Canary Islands. Synapomorphies for the Pegomya meridiana species group are most evident in the females: A laterally compressed <b>oviscapt</b> with blade-shaped cerci and a unique forward displacement of spiracles VI onto tergite V. Both sexes of P. provecta and P. canariensis are further lacking abdominal spiracles VII, a character state not previously reported from Anthomyiidae.

They are preserved in amber from the Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) of Lebanon, Albian of northern Spain, upper Albian to lower Cenomanian of northern Myanmar, and Late Cretaceous of New Jersey USA (Turonian) and Alberta, Canada (Campanian). Taxa are as follows, with significance as noted: In Stratiomyomorpha: Stratiomyidae (Cretaceogaster pygmaeus Teskey [2 new specimens in Canadian amber], Lysistrata emerita Grimaldi & Arillo, gen. et sp. n.

In Muscomorpha: Acroceridae (Schlingeromyia minuta Grimaldi & Hauser, gen. et sp. n. and Burmacyrtus rusmithi Grimaldi & Hauser gen. et sp. n., in Burmese amber, the only definitive species of the family from the Cretaceous); Mythicomyiidae (Microburmyia analvena Grimaldi & Cumming gen. et sp. n. and M. veanalvena Grimaldi & Cumming, sp. n., stem-group species of the family, both in Burmese amber); Apsilocephalidae or near (therevoid family-group) (Kumaromyia burmitica Grimaldi & Hauser, gen. et sp. n.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{animal species}} exhibit {{morphological}} asymmetries in male genitalia. In insects, left-right genital asymmetries evolved many times independently {{and have been}} proposed to appear in response to changes in mating position. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between mating position and the interaction of male and female genitalia during mating, and functional analyses of asymmetric morphologies in genitalia are virtually non-existent. We investigated the relationship between mating position, asymmetric genital morphology and genital coupling in the fruit fly Drosophila pachea, in which males possess an asymmetric pair of external genital lobes and mate in an unusual right-sided position on top of the female. RESULTS: We examined D. pachea copulation by video recording and by scanning electron microscopy of genital complexes. We observed that the interlocking of male and female genital organs in D. pachea is remarkably different from genital coupling in the well-studied D. melanogaster. In D. pachea, the female <b>oviscapt</b> valves are asymmetrically twisted during copulation. The male's asymmetric lobes tightly grasp the female's abdomen in an asymmetric 'locking' position, with the left and right lobes contacting different female structures. The male anal plates, which grasp the female genitalia in D. melanogaster, do not contact the female in D. pachea. Experimental lobe amputation by micro-surgery and laser-ablation of lobe bristles led to aberrant coupling of genitalia and variable mating positions, in which the male was tilted towards the right side of the female. CONCLUSION: We describe, for the first time, how the mating position depends on coupling of male and female genitalia in a species with asymmetric genitalia and one-sided mating position. Our results show that D. pachea asymmetric epandrial lobes do not act as a compensatory mechanism for the change from symmetric to one-sided mating position that occurred during evolution of D. pachea's ancestors, but as holding devices with distinct specialized functions on the left and right sides...|$|E
