25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E
25|$|Behavior {{therapy is}} a rich tradition. It is well {{researched}} with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict {{the way we think}} and feel. <b>Our</b> <b>behavior</b> sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E

50|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} {{is an example}} of how bad experiences can also lead to <b>our</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It demonstrates how our thoughts influence our feelings about ourselves and therefore our actions in society around us.

40|$|Around the world, {{infectious}} disease epidemics continue to threaten people’s health. When epidemics strike, we often respond by changing <b>our</b> <b>behaviors</b> to reduce <b>our</b> risk of infection. This response {{is sometimes called}} “social distancing”. Since behavior changes can be costly, {{we would like to}} know the optimal social distancing behavior. But the benefits of changes in behavior depend on the course of the epidemic, which itself depends on <b>our</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Differential population game theory provides a method for resolving this circular dependence. Here, I present the analysis of a special case of the differential SIR epidemic population game with social distancing when the relative infection rate is linear but bounded below by zero. Equilibrium solutions are constructed in closed-form for an open-ended epidemic. Constructions are also provided for epidemics that are stopped by the deployment of a vaccination that becomes available a fixed-time after the start of the epidemic. This can be used to anticipate a window of opportunity during which mass vaccination can significantly reduce the cost of an epidemic. c ○ 2013 Tim Reluga 2 Reluga 1...|$|R

2500|$|Therefore, {{subconscious}} racism {{can influence}} our visual processing and how our minds work {{when we are}} subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. In thinking about crime, for example, social psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt (2004) of Stanford University holds that, [...] "blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects." [...] Such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> towards other people or even towards objects. Thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears {{of which we are}} not aware.|$|E
2500|$|Thought {{suppression}} {{also has}} the capability to change <b>our</b> <b>behavior.</b> Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, and Jetten found that when people were asked {{not to think about}} the stereotypes of a certain group (e.g. a [...] "skinhead"), their written descriptions about a group member's typical day contained less stereotypical thoughts. However, when they were told they were going to meet an individual they had just written about, those in the suppression group sat significantly farther away from the [...] "skinhead" [...] (just by virtue of his clothes being present). These results show that even though there may have been an initial enhancement of the stereotype, participants were able to prevent this from being communicated in their writing; this was not true for their behavior though.|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{is known}} for his theory that there is a single moral obligation, which he called the [...] "Categorical Imperative", and is derived from the concept of duty. Kant defines the demands of the moral law as [...] "categorical imperatives". Categorical imperatives are {{principles}} that are intrinsically valid; they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed by everyone in all situations and circumstances, if <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> is to observe the moral law. The Categorical Imperative provides a test against which moral statements can be assessed. Kant also stated that the moral means and ends {{can be applied to the}} categorical imperative, that rational beings can pursue certain [...] "ends" [...] using the appropriate [...] "means". Ends based on physical needs or wants can create merely hypothetical imperatives. The categorical imperative can only be based on something that is an [...] "end in itself", that is, an end that is not a means to some other need, desire, or purpose. Kant believed that the moral law is a principle of reason itself, and is not based on contingent facts about the world, such as what would make us happy, but to act on the moral law which has no other motive than [...] "worthiness of being happy". Accordingly, he believed that moral obligation applies only to rational agents.|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had {{encouraged}} listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections. A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that [...] "can manipulate <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist". Involved in the discussion on the bill was a California State Assembly Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified. The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued. The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen and Styx, and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: [...] "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." [...] However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated. House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative Bob Dornan (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label; the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.

2500|$|Cognitive {{control and}} {{stimulus}} control, which {{is associated with}} operant and classical conditioning, represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors. Cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we {{would be at the}} mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and <b>our</b> <b>behavior</b> is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice....

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15)....In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior. Subjects with ADHD exhibit less activation of the medial prefrontal cortex than healthy controls even when they succeed in such tasks and utilize different circuits.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Stimulus-driven behavioral responses (i.e., stimulus control) that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.|$|E
