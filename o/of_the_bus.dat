5|$|The O-Bahn Busway is {{a guided}} busway {{that is part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> rapid transit system {{servicing}} the northeastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The O-Bahn system was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen.|$|E
5|$|Ferry {{passengers}} {{would face}} a lengthier trek {{to reach the}} new pier. By relocating the new piers 300 m away, {{it is estimated that}} the Star Ferry could lose perhaps 13 percent or more of passengers due to its inconvenience. On the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour, the proposed relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> terminus which acts as a feeder for the ferry is forecast to further reduce passenger numbers by one-fifth.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching madder red colour. They also changed {{the entrance to the}} bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, {{the driver}} of an X43 on the M60 {{motorway}} fell unconscious while the vehicle was moving.

She won several awards for this action, including an award for Outstanding Bravery at the 2006 Pride of Britain Awards, a Vodafone Life Savers Award, a Royal Humane Society Testimonial on Vellum, a Chief Constable's Commendation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the North London Line {{suffered}} a reduction in passengers and, especially, revenue, owing to the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> tram and Underground networks. In 1909, the NLR passed general handing of trains to the LNWR. By 1913, numbers had dropped to 44.6 per cent compared to 1900, and by 1921 to only 23.3 percent and the patronage of Broad Street station declined accordingly. On 8 September 1915, the station was damaged by a Zeppelin attack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The paper {{presents}} {{the idea and}} practical solution how to implement the well-known and widely used VME <b>bus</b> for <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISA <b>bus</b> {{that is used by}} <b>the</b> module <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-board computer DIMM-PC. Such a solution was imposed by the desire to take advantage of perfectly developed and tuned hardware layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VME <b>bus</b> for <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> both buses in questions. Thus, cross-assignment of individual lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISA <b>bus</b> to corresponding lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VME <b>bus</b> is presented along with <b>the</b> architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CPU based on the 80386 microprocessor that is used for the newly-designed single-board computer DIMM-PC. <b>The</b> major objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project is to present all <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> cycles, attributable to both ISA and VME buses on a single hardware platform.

Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and prisoners who had committed minor infractions were kept in the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility.|$|E
5|$|Local bus {{transportation}} {{is provided by}} Broward County Transit (BCT), the county bus system. BCT provides for connections with the bus systems {{in other parts of}} the metropolitan area: Metrobus in Dade County and Palm Tran in Palm Beach County. Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system, connects the major cities and airports of South Florida. In November 2006, Broward County voters rejected a one-cent-per-hundred sales tax increase intended to fund transportation projects such as light rail and expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> system.|$|E
5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> {{had begun to}} pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died.

5|$|On October 23, 2007, it was {{announced}} that the Dominator would be moved to Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia. Dominator sits on the former site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> parking lot, behind Berserker, an Intamin Looping Starship. When it was relocated to Kings Dominion, it received a new paint job. The supports remained dark blue, but the track was painted orange instead of yellow. The record-breaking loop, however, is still painted yellow. It opened to the public on May 24, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Police {{had found}} and arrested some {{suspects}} within 24 {{hours of the}} crime. From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants {{with the help of}} the male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims to find one of the assailants.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed, but {{features}} ticket machines, a waiting room, kisok and taxicab stand. There is parking nearby {{in a parking}} house. The bus station features two sections, one for local buses and one for regional buses. Between them they have six stops. However, because of the design of European Road E18, the station can only serve buses on the E18 which runs westwards—eastbound buses are served by a bus stop {{on the other side}} of the freeway. Ownership and operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> terminal is carried out by Akershus Kollektivterminaler.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{connected}} Underground stations at Victoria, {{on different}} levels and built {{more than a}} century apart. The older one, on the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> station, serves the District and Circle lines, constructed by 'cut and cover' methods just below road level. The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own ticket hall, and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop through St. Louis. The highway starts at an interchange with US127 south of St. Louis at exit114. From there, it follows State Road northward through farmland into {{the southern edge of}} town. There, Bus. US127 follows Main Street through residential areas into downtown. At the intersection with M-46 (Washington Street), the business loop turns westerly along the other highway, running concurrently. The combined highway crosses the Pine River and runs through residential areas as it exits the town. As Bus. US127/M-46 approaches US127, it passes several businesses. The business loop terminates at exit127A near the northern terminus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US127 for Alma.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) {{starts at}} the Price Road {{interchange}} along US127 south of St. Johns. From here, Bus.

US127 continues north on North Old US27 to its northern terminus. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 nearly coincides with {{the northern end of}} the existing US127 freeway in Clinton County. Approximately one-half mile (0.8km) north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US127 interchange north of St. Johns, the US127 freeway merges back onto its former alignment to proceed northerly into Gratiot County.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti to the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) {{may have been used}} for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
