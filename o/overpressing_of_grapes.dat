Purpose: The aim {{of this article is}} to review of the literature on the peculiarities of the periapical resorptive processes. Conclusion: The absence of a physiological narrowing is challenging to the achievement of satisfactory early and late therapeutic results. It makes probable either the <b>overpressing</b> <b>of</b> necrotic, infected material when preparing the endodontic space or the <b>overpressing</b> <b>of</b> the sealer when sealing the root canal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of exogenous melatonin treatment <b>of</b> pre-veraison <b>grapes</b> on phenolic components and antioxidants <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berries and wine. The results showed an increase in the concentration of cyanin- 3 -O-glucoside, peonidin derivatives, and two flavanols [namely (+) -catechins and (−) -epicatechins] <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> as well as flavonols in both grapes and wine due to the application of melatonin. These compounds are derivatives of the catalysate of flavonoid 3 ’-hydroxylase (F 3 ’H) in the flavonoid synthesis pathway of plants. It can be inferred that melatonin increased the activity of F 3 ’H or expression of VvF 3 ’H during grape berry maturation. In addition, two melatonin treatments <b>of</b> pre-veraison <b>grape</b> berries reduced the DPPH radical-scavenging ability and copper ion-reducing power <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> and wine, whereas one melatonin treatment just reduced those in wine.

The {{numerous}} uses <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> in making wine, beverages, jelly, and other products, {{has made it}} one of the most economically important plants worldwide. The complex phytochemistry of the berry is characterized by a wide variety of compounds, most of which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic or health promoting properties. Among them, flavonoids are the most abundant and widely studied, and have enjoyed greater attention among grape researchers in the last century.
