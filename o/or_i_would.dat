I don't think you worth the trouble, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given you, long since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough.

The technology and concept were so genius. She was inspired after discovering Cuccarini's performance online. Thank God for YouTube <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have never been exposed to something so inspiring. I never worked so hard on anything in my life as that performance for the Billboard Awards." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash {{interpreted}} [...] where Moses told Aaron, [...] "This is {{what the}} Lord meant when He said: ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.'" [...] The Midrash taught that God told this to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, when in [...] God said, [...] "there I will meet with the children of Israel; and the Tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory." [...] And {{after the death of}} Nadab and Abihu, Moses said to Aaron, [...] "At the time that God told me, I thought that either you <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be stricken, but now I know that they [...] are greater than you or me." ...|$|E
2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, and I would say, [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] <b>Or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack for Days of Heaven is {{a strong}} {{reflection}} of the film's context. Ennio Morricone provided the film's score and received his first Academy Award nomination in his soundtrack composing career {{for his work on}} the film. Morricone recalled the process as being [...] "demanding" [...] and said of Malick: [...] "He didn't know me very well, so he made suggestions, and in some cases, gave musical solutions. This kind of annoyed me because he'd say: 'This thing [...] [...] [...] try it with three flutes.' Something impossible! So, to humor him, I would do it with three flutes and then he'd decide to use my version after all. His was impossible <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have written it myself. And more nitpicking like that which means he was very attentive and careful about music." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Russian {{delegation}} is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...' ...|$|E
2500|$|So I grew up (in Ottawa), in this capital city. My parents used to {{work for}} the government, and I went to {{elementary}} school, high school, and the university in the city. And there was a place on Sussex Drive (Sussex Drive is where the Prime Minister's house is, right below Parliament Hill), and there was a little club there called Le Hibou, which in French means 'the owl.' And it was run by a gentleman named Harvey Glatt, and he brought every, and I mean every blues star that you <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ever have wanted to have seen through Ottawa in the late 50s, well I guess more late 60s sort of, in around the Newport jazz rediscovery. I was going to Le Hibou and hearing James Cotton, Otis Spann, Pinetop Perkins, and Muddy Waters. I actually jammed behind Muddy Waters. S. P. Leary left the drum kit one night, and Muddy said 'anybody out there play drums? I don't have a drummer.' And I walked on stage and we started, I don't know, Little Red Rooster, something. He said 'keep that beat going, you make Muddy feel good.' And I heard Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett). Many, many times I saw Howlin' Wolf. And of course Buddy Guy, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. So I was exposed to all of these players, playing there as part of this scene to service the academic community in Ottawa, a very well-educated community. Had I lived in a different town I don't think that this would have happened, because it was just the confluence of educated government workers, and then also all the colleges in the area, Ottawa University, Carleton, and all the schools—these people were interested in blues culture.|$|E
