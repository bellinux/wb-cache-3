25|$|Both {{analgesia}} {{and drug}} addiction are {{functions of the}} mu <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor,</b> the class of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> first identified as responsive to morphine. Tolerance {{is associated with the}} superactivation of the receptor, which may be affected by the degree of endocytosis caused by the opioid administered, and leads to a superactivation of cyclic AMP signaling. Long-term use of morphine in palliative care and the management of chronic pain always entails a risk that the patient develops tolerance or physical dependence. There are many kinds of rehabilitation treatment, including pharmacologically based treatments with naltrexone, methadone, or ibogaine.|$|E
50|$|The receptors for enkephalin are {{the delta}} <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and mu <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> <b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are {{a group of}} G-protein-coupled <b>receptors,</b> with other <b>opioids</b> as ligands as well. The other {{endogenous}} opioids are dynorphins (that bind to kappa receptors), endorphins (mu receptors), endomorphins, and nociceptin/orphanin FQ.

50|$|<b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are a {{group of}} {{inhibitory}} G protein-coupled <b>receptors</b> with <b>opioids</b> as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are ~40% identical to somatostatin <b>receptors</b> (SSTRs). <b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are distributed widely in the brain, and are {{also found in the}} spinal cord and digestive tract.|$|R
40|$|<b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are found}} in the central nervous system (CNS) and are {{classified}} as mu (µ), kappa (κ), delta (δ) and sigma (σ) <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> <b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> belong to the large family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and have diverse and important physiological roles. <b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are not uniformly distributed in the CNS and {{are found in}} areas concerned with pain, with the highest concentration in the cerebral cortex, followed by the amygdala, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain and spinal cord. Activated delta <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are coupled to Gi 1 while activated mu <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are coupled to Gi 3 in neuroblastoma cells. Mu <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are activated by mu receptor agonists and are coupled through the Gαi 1 and GαoA. Both mu and kappa <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are coupled via both Gi and Gz and <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are important targets for thousands of pharmacological agents. GPCRs typically require activation by agonists for their signalling activity to be initiated but some of the GPCRs may display basal or spontaneous signalling activity {{in the absence of an}} agonist. The stimulation of these receptors triggers analgesic effects and affects the function of the nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and other body systems. Hundreds of analogs of opioid peptides have been synthesized in an effort to make the compounds more active, selective, and resistant to biodegradation than the endogenous ligands. All these modifications resulted in obtaining very selective agonists and antagonists with high affinity at mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, which are useful in further studies on the pharmacology of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> in a mammalian organism...|$|R
25|$|Salvinorin A {{is found}} {{with several other}} {{structurally}} related salvinorins. Salvinorin is a trans-neoclerodane diterpenoid. It acts as a kappa <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist and is the first known compound acting on this receptor {{that is not an}} alkaloid.|$|E
25|$|In {{simplified}} terms, buprenorphine can essentially {{be thought}} of as a non-selective, mixed agonist–antagonist <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> modulator, acting as a weak partial agonist of the MOR, an antagonist of the KOR, an antagonist of the DOR, and a relatively low-affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1.|$|E
25|$|An {{overdose}} of dextropropoxyphene {{may lead to}} various systemic effects. Excessive <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation {{is responsible for the}} CNS depression, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, miosis, and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for mood- or thought-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose will increase CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to cocaine, in mammals, {{has been shown}} to interfere with the expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> which can have repercussions in its activity. Likewise, microRNAs, such as let- 7, have been shown to regulate the expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and hence their functions in mammals and in vitro experiments. In light of this, using the zebrafish embryos as a model our aim here was to evaluate the actions of cocaine in the expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and let- 7 d miRNA during embryogenesis. In order to determine the effects produced by cocaine on the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> (zfmor, zfdor 1 and zfdor 2) and let- 7 d miRNA (dre-let- 7 d) and its precursors (dre-let- 7 d- 1 and dre-let- 7 d- 2), embryos were exposed to 1. 5 µM cocaine hydrochloride (HCl). Our results revealed that cocaine upregulated dre-let- 7 d and its precursors, and also increased the expression of zfmor, zfdor 1 and zfdor 2 during early developmental stages and decreased them in late embryonic stages. The changes observed in the expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> might occur through dre-let- 7 d, since DNA sequences and the morpholinos of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> microinjections altered the expression of dre-let- 7 d and its precursors. Likewise, <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and dre-let- 7 d showed similar distributions in the central nervous system (CNS) and at the periphery, pointing to a possible interrelationship between them. In conclusion, the silencing and overexpression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> altered the expression of dre-let- 7 d, which points to the notion that cocaine via dre-let- 7 can modulate the expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> Our study provides new insights into the actions of cocaine during zebrafish embryogenesis, indicating a role of miRNAs, let- 7 d, in development and its relationship with gene expression of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> related to pain and addiction process...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} flavonoids, naringenin {{has been found}} to possess weak {{activity}} at the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> It specifically acts as a non-selective antagonist of all three <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> albeit with weak affinity.|$|R
50|$|Sigma (σ) receptors {{were once}} {{considered}} to be <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> due to the antitussive actions of many opioid drugs' being mediated via σ receptors, and the first selective σ agonists being derivatives of opioid drugs (e.g., allylnormetazocine). However, σ receptors were found to not be activated by endogenous opioid peptides, and are {{quite different from the}} other <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> in both function and gene sequence, so they are now not usually classified with the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Psychoactive {{drugs are}} often {{prescribed}} to manage pain. The subjective experience of pain is primarily regulated by endogenous opioid peptides. Thus, pain {{can often be}} managed using psychoactives that operate on this neurotransmitter system, also known as <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists. This class of drugs can be highly addictive, and includes opiate narcotics, like morphine and codeine. NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are also analgesics. These agents also reduce eicosanoid-mediated inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase.|$|E
25|$|In {{scientific}} research, bivalent ligands {{have been}} used to study receptor dimers and to investigate their properties. This class of ligands was pioneered by Philip S. Portoghese and coworkers while studying the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> system. Bivalent ligands were also reported early on by Micheal Conn and coworkers for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Since these early reports, there have been many bivalent ligands reported for various GPCR systems including cannabinoid, serotonin, oxytocin, and melanocortin receptor systems, and for GPCR-LIC systems (D2 and nACh receptors).|$|E
25|$|Menthol is {{an organic}} {{compound}} made synthetically or obtained from corn mint, peppermint, or other mint oils. It is a waxy, crystalline substance, clear or white in color, which is solid {{at room temperature}} and melts slightly above. The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. Menthol also acts as a weak kappa <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist.|$|E
40|$|Quaternary {{narcotic}} antagonists {{that are}} assumed not {{to penetrate the}} blood–brain barrier following systemic administration are commonly used to distinguish between peripheral and central actions of opiates. In mammals, these antagonists have a lower affinity for <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> than their tertiary parent compounds. The relative affinity of quaternary vs. tertiary antagonists either for <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> in non-mammalian species or for specific receptor subtypes has, however, not been determined. Using brain tissues from a passerine.. songbird Junco hyemalis, we found the affinity of the quaternary antagonist, naloxone methiodide Nal MI, for brain <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> {{to be less than}} 10 % that of Nal HCl. Further, Nal MI affinity for m and d receptors is 8. 7 % and 3. 7 %, respectively, that of Nal HCl. These results confirm that tertiary narcotic antagonist quaternization substantially reduces the affinity of these derivatives for central <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> They show that this reduction is receptor-type selective, and they extend previous reports demonstrating functional similarities between mammalian and non-mammalian central <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R
25|$|Other analgesics work {{peripherally}} (i.e., not on {{the brain}} or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> on peripheral sensory neurons. A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain. Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are a {{group of}} G protein-coupled <b>receptors</b> with <b>opioids</b> as ligands. The {{endogenous}} opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins, and nociceptin. The <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opiate receptors were discovered in 1972 by the American neuroscientist and pharmacologist named Candace Pert.|$|R
25|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{are given}} about how tolerance develops, including <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> phosphorylation (which {{would change the}} receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from G-proteins (leading to receptor desensitization), μ-opioid receptor internalization or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the cAMP pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.) CCK might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically proglumide, {{have been shown to}} slow the development of tolerance to morphine.|$|E
25|$|The European League Against Rheumatism in 2008 {{recommends}} tramadol {{and other}} weak opioids {{may be used}} for pain but not strong opioids. A 2015 review found fair evidence to support tramadol use if other medications do not work. Goldenberg et al suggest that tramadol works via its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, rather than via its action as a weak <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist. The combination of tramadol and paracetemol has demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability (for up to two years in the management of other pain conditions) without the development of tolerance. It is as effective as a combination of codeine (another mild opioid) and paracetamol but produces less sleepiness and constipation.|$|E
25|$|A {{naltrexone}} treatment {{study by}} Anton et al., {{released by the}} National Institutes of Health in February 2008 and published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, has shown that alcoholics having a certain variant of the <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> gene (G polymorphism of SNP Rs1799971 in the gene OPRM1), known as Asp40, demonstrated strong response to naltrexone and were {{far more likely to}} experience success at cutting back or discontinuing their alcohol intake altogether, while for those lacking the gene variant, naltrexone appeared to be no different from placebo. The G allele of OPRM1 is most common in individuals of Asian descent, with 60% to 70% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian ancestry having at least one copy, as opposed to 30% of Europeans and few Africans.|$|E

50|$|Although NOP shares high {{sequence}} identity (~60%) {{with the}} ‘classical’ <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> μ-OR (MOR), κ-OR (KOR), and δ-OR (DOR), it possesses {{little or no}} affinity for opioid peptides or morphine-like compounds.

25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{is quickly}} {{hydrolysed}} {{in the liver}} to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8–12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in renal failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist– {{its main}} effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
50|$|Research on methylnaltrexone {{continued}} in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at the University of Chicago through the 1990s. More recent investigations, however, discovered <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> on peripheral sensory neurons. Since inflammatory pain is blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating such peripheral <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> MNTX may increase pain under such circumstances.|$|R
40|$|Subtle {{differences}} in coupling to different G proteins exist {{among the three}} <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> (δ, κ and μ). Recently, differential coupling of Gα 16 to the three <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> has been observed. To further examine the ability of these <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> to couple to Gα 16, four chimeric <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> (M 3 D, D 3 M, M 5 D and D 5 M) were constructed. Like their parental μ- (MOR) and δ- (DOR) <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> these chimeras inhibited cAMP formation via pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/Go protein. When coexpressed with Gα 16, M 3 D chimera stimulated phospholipase C {{to a greater extent}} than that induced by MOR, but lower than those induced by DOR. D 3 M, M 5 D and D 5 M chimeras all behaved like MOR. These results indicated that all intracelluar domains of the receptor are involved in the coupling to Gα 16, with some domains more crucial than others. Introduction of a point mutation in M 3 D further identified Leu 80 in intracellular loop one of DOR can enhance the receptor's ability to interact with Gα 16. To delineate the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence, cultured cells stably expressing the MOR and κ- (KOR) receptor were subjected to long-term exposure to opioids. Such chronic opioid treatments led to compensatory increase in adenylyl cyclase activity upon removal of the agonists. The results showed that this response is mediated through both <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, and did not involve receptor desensitization. This overshoot response can be induced via all three subtype of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> and did not show any differential pattern among the receptors...|$|R

In in vitro systems much work has been done to characterize the subtypes of G proteins regulated by <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> However, to achieve this goal in vivo is a complicated issue. Pioneering studies involving pertussis toxin demonstrated the regulation of G(i) /G(o) to produce supraspinal opioid analgesia. In characterizing those G proteins regulated by mu and delta <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> to induce supraspinal analgesia in the mouse, our group has explored the effectiveness of in vivo administration of antisera raised against different Gα subunits and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to their mRNAs.

25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo <b>opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E

40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{description}} of the molecular structure of <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> our understanding of this regulatory system has improved greatly. The determination of the regions and amino acid residues involved in ligand binding to μ, δ and κ <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> have been achieved.

The involvement of the cloned <b>opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> μ, δ, κ in analgesia has been determined by means of in vivo injection of antibodies and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed to the receptor proteins or their respective mRNA.
