25|$|The Lakers then {{faced the}} Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Finals. In game 1, the Lakers {{blew out the}} Suns 128-107 led by Bryant's 40 points {{including}} 23 in the third quarter. Odom came off the bench to tally 19 points, 19 rebounds, and three assists. In game 2 Bryant {{played the role of}} facilitator, putting up 13 assists, while Gasol recorded 29 points, 9 rebounds, and five assists. The teams were tied at 90-90 heading into the fourth quarter, but Bryant and Gasol led the fourth quarter rally and the Lakers won the game 124-112. Game 3 was played in Phoenix, where the Suns used their big men and physical play to win the game. Amar'e Stoudemire scored 42 points and grabbed 11 rebounds while Robin Lopez 20 points. Odom and Bynum, however, both picked up fouls early and were ineffective for the Lakers for most of the game. The Lakers only scored 15 points in the second quarter and were down 86-84 in after three quarters. The Lakers were able to take the lead 90-89 with 8:47 to play, but the Suns rallied back to win 118-109. After battling each other in game 4 and slugging out a 23-23 first quarter, the Suns erupted for a 41 points in the second quarter, shooting 74%. Early in the 4th quarter the Lakers led 87-85. However, the Suns reserve players (who outscored the Lakers reserves 54-20) produced and 18-3 run in the 4th which the Lakers never recovered from despite Bryant's 38 points and 10 assists. In game 5, the Lakers surged to a 16-point lead in the first half including a 21-4 run and led by 18 points by half time. Steve Nash, who had 29 points and 11 assists in the game, led the Suns to a 16-4 rally in the third quarter to trim the lead to six {{by the end of the}} period and one with 2:52 left in the game. Jason Richardson made a three pointer with 3.5 seconds left in the game to tie the score 101-101. On the next possession, Bryant, who had 30 points and 11 assists in the game, air-balled a three, but Artest offensively rebounded and made a game winning layup as time expired. In game 6 in Phoenix, the Lakers had the lead for most of the game. Los Angeles outscored the Suns 23-10 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> minutes of the second quarter to lead 65-53 at the break and were up by 17 entering the fourth. However the Suns went on a 16-4 run and cut the Lakers lead to 95-90 with 6:09 remaining in the game. Artest scored 25 in the game and Bryant had a 37-point performance including nine points in the final two minutes to win the game 111-103 and clinch the series 4-2.|$|E

Visibility is also a meteorological parameter which is provided my national weather services.

Daily averages of the visibility of 17 stations inside Portugal were used in order to investigate to investigate possible trends <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> decade. <b>Eight</b> stations reported values between 1994 and 2005, two stations start reporting observations in 2006 and further 7 stations provide data since the end of 1997. However one station (Sagres) stopped reports about visibility in 2001 likely due to relocation to a different place. Major problems in the analysis occurred with respect to the number of measurements for each day or to the number of days where daily averages were reported. At some station the measurement frequency were almost hourly (24 measurements a day) whereas at other stations only 3 hourly or even less frequent measurements contribute to the daily average. For most stations most at the time daily values were reported. However at some stations a data gap of about half a year occurred. Figure 1 shows a color coded trend for the 17 stations investigated.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. Holstein calves were photographed and {{measured}} {{over a period}} of 84 days to determine the feasibility of Image Analysis as a measurement tool. It was determined that the disparity between actual measurements and image analysis measurements decreased as the bone length increased, and that image analysis could be used to monitor growth successfully in large ungulates, using the length of certain bone. Image analysis was then used to evaluate growth in Holstein calves on two weaning programs (weaned early at six weeks of age and weaned later at eight weeks of age). Calves were weighed and photographed {{over a period of}} 224 days {{to determine the effects of}} weaning on skeletal symmetry. Weaning time did have an affect on the skeletal symmetry of the calves, with calves weaned earlier found to be more asymmetrical. The extent to which skeletal symmetry is affected by a stress is determined by the nature and duration of the stress. The growth and development of Thoroughbred foals was recorded and photographed for a period of 300 days and the relative asymmetry for bilateral traits was assessed. Thoroughbred foal growth correlated to statistics reported <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twenty <b>eight</b> years. Asymmetry can be detected in growing foals using image analysis. Weaning stress produced some asymmetry that the foals were able to recover from. One can use highly correlated body weight and height measurements to produce a tool stud managers can used to monitor growth. In young training Thoroughbreds (between 18 and 24 months of age), no significant asymmetry was found in the forelimbs but the hind legs displayed asymmetry, which has interesting implications for training and for performance criteria in the racehorse. Tools can be produced to monitor the growth and development of Thoroughbred foals destined to race, which can improve their management and the duration of their racing careers...|$|R

Results: All participants improved in muscular endurance, aerobic fitness, and functional status. Perceived strengths of the program included increased motivation for exercise, the socialisation aspect of group-based training, instructor support, and relevant sexuality education content.

The comparative analysis of two sets of civic standards, one developed in the U.

As a result of those initiatives, the Armenian Ministry of Education and Science has introduced a civic education course into the Armenian schools based on the demand from the society and support from international agencies. All three projects were developed according to the American civics standards and, subsequently, introduced elements of Armenian culture as a result of interaction with and involvement of Armenian participants. The civic initiatives have had enormous influence on the Armenian education milieu and the society overall.

40|$|Kennewick Man, {{referred}} to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially radiocarbon dated to 8, 340 – 9, 200 calibrated years before present (bp) 1. His population affinities {{have been the subject of}} scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted 2. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans 2. In order to resolve Kennewick Man’s ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to ∼ 1 × coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans <b>over</b> at least <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> millennia.

40|$|This article {{develops}} a {{general theory of}} bargaining between a minority, its host state, and outside lobby actor to explain why minorities shift their demands from affirmative action to cultural autonomy to seces-sionism and back, often {{in the absence of}} clear economic or security incentives. This paper uses a simple game tree model to show that if a minority believes that it enjoys significant support from a powerful na-tional homeland or other external actor, it radicalized its demands against the host state, even if the center has credibly committed to protect minority rights. Conversely, if a minority believes that it enjoys no external support, then it will accommodate the host state, even in the presence of significant majority repression. As a general theory of claim-making, this model challenges structural theories of demands that rely on static eco-nomic differences or historical grievances to explain claim-making. It also challenges security dilemma arguments that hold that minority radicalization is mainly a function of ethnic fears. The model’s hypoth-eses are tested using longitudinal analysis of Hungarians in Vojvodina during the 1990 s, as the Yugoslav dog that ‘‘barked but did not bite. ’’ Careful examination of claim-making in this case demonstrates the su-perior explanatory power of the ethnic bargaining model as compared with dominant theories of minority mobilization in the literature. Recent trends in violent conflict demonstrate the need for a general theory of group claim-making. 1 <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> decade, only <b>eight</b> of 110 armed conflicts were fought between states; most of the remaining wars were waged between minorities and their state governments over claims of self-determination (Wallensteen and Sollenberg, 2000).

40|$|Internationally, Australia’s {{tertiary}} education system, comprising {{the higher education}} and vocational education and training (VET) sectors, is highly regarded, with both sectors subject to ongoing national review and reforms. This paper explores in detail the multiple issues that lie at what might be termed the ‘boundaries and connections’ between these sectors. One marker that delineates the sectoral boundaries is the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), in particular AQF level 5 (VET diploma) and AQF level 6 (associate degree/advanced diploma). VET diplomas sit {{on one side of}} this boundary, and those financed under the previous VET FEE-HELP program (to be replaced by the new VET Student Loans program) have recently attracted considerable public scrutiny. The conditions for the operation of the {{tertiary education}} system, especially the boundaries and connections between the VET and higher education sectors, are set by national and state/territory policies, embodied in regulations, programs and funding. In exploring the multiple issues that have evolved at the sectoral boundaries and connections, this paper highlights examples that have eroded clear differentiation between the sectors, as well as their mutual value within a coherent tertiary education system. The present situation has been caused by a combination of: differing sector-specific national policies and agreements; differing sectoral financing/funding; and differing sectoral legislation, regulation and standards, as well as overlapping qualification frameworks and different standards for courses and qualifications. Key messages 	VET participation is declining in relation to higher education participation as a consequence of policy and funding reforms that have travelled along ‘different tracks’ <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six to <b>eight</b> years. 	The boundaries and connections between the sectors present examples of significant confusion and of considerable inter-institutional contest, as well as willing collaboration. In aggregate, this imposes an unquantifiable national cost burden. 	The establishment of student ‘loans’, spanning VET diplomas to degrees, has, by design or not, reset higher education and VET sector policy, program and funding boundaries. 	From the perspective of students, the ability to pick and mix the best from university and vocational education and training, be it skilling, academic study or work experience, can only be beneficial to the needs of employers and to students’ future jobs. 	Policy and incentives need to ensure the equitable funding of mid-level professionals, including, for example, associate degrees and higher apprenticeships. 	Improving and systematising cross-sector transfer arrangements for students is a priority, supported by use of common data standards and a system-wide unique student identifier (utilising existing sectoral numbering) ...|$|R
