This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of careful planning.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} Arkham Originss boss battles were <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of {{improvement}} over its predecessors; they offered dynamic, multiphase conflicts {{with their own}} stories. While not considering all equally fun or impressive, reviewers said that their variety and unpredictability provided excitement. Less-notable characters from the comics were considered less compelling than more-popular characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in <b>one</b> <b>area</b> {{for a while before}} moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Toby Creek {{is predominantly}} rural. Most of it (61.3 percent) is forested land. Considerably less common are grassland (19.6 percent) and urban land (16.4 percent). A total of 2.1 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed consists of wetlands and 0.6 percent consists of mining lands. The mining land is confined to <b>one</b> <b>area</b> {{near the mouth of}} the creek.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development. Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of thunderstorm activity. By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any <b>one</b> <b>area</b> to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E
5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in <b>one</b> <b>area.</b> That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
30|$|In {{comparison}} to the self-contained model, models of ECS allow teachers to focus on fewer content areas. Teachers in model A only specialize in <b>one</b> content <b>area,</b> thereby “giving up” <b>one</b> content <b>area</b> to their team partner. This relieves them of <b>one</b> content <b>area,</b> placing this model slightly below self-contained on the continuum (Fig.  1). Teachers in models B, C, and E have fewer content areas on which to focus, because they either specialize in more than <b>one</b> content <b>area</b> (B, some E) or teach more classes of students (C, some E), thus relieving them of additional content areas. The lowest on this continuum are models D and F, in which teachers are responsible for very few content areas. Most specialists in models D and F are responsible for <b>one</b> content <b>area,</b> although this number may be slightly higher for some specialists.|$|R

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. <b>One</b> <b>area</b> within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|Isolated seamounts {{and those}} without clear {{volcanic}} origins are less common; examples include Bollons Seamount, Eratosthenes Seamount, Axial Seamount and Gorringe Ridge. If all known seamounts were collected into <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> {{they would make}} a landform the size of Europe. Their overall abundance makes them {{one of the most}} common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth, a sort of exploratory frontier.|$|E
5|$|Most border {{units were}} based in forts as were their predecessors, the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; {{in many cases they}} were based in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) were based in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E

5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E
5|$|On July8, the Australian Associated Press {{reported}} {{that there was a}} typhoon about 195km (120mi) east of Samar. The storm dropped heavy rainfall over a period of a week, the most since 1919 in <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> which caused river flooding and one death. On July12, local newspapers also reported a typhoon striking Seoul, South Korea, killing 52people and leaving thousands homeless. However, neither of the two storms were mentioned in the Monthly Weather Review summary for the month.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a spin-off featuring a different protagonist, Resident Evil 3 was designed to have more action-oriented gameplay than previous Resident Evil games. It features a larger number of enemies for the player to defeat and introduces the eponymous Nemesis creature, which periodically pursues the player from <b>one</b> <b>area</b> to the next {{until the end of the}} game. The game uses the same engine as its predecessors and features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles.|$|E

A survey of <b>one</b> <b>area</b> suggested that there is about one P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs.
