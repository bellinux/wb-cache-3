5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>pictures,</b> the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation.

This allowed Beato to take a number <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we address the role <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> books in kindergartners’ {{learning}} of mathematics. The chapter {{is based on}} various studies we carried out on this topic from different perspectives. All studies sought to {{provide insight into the}} power <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> books to {{contribute to the development of}} mathematical understanding by young children. We start the chapter with some background information about picture books as a didactical tool in mathematics education. Then, we discuss a framework <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> book characteristics that support young children’s learning of mathematics. In the next section, we give a short impression of children’s spontaneous mathematics-related utterances that occur during the reading <b>of</b> a <b>picture</b> book. This section is followed by a deeper look at the influence <b>of</b> the <b>pictures</b> in a picture book. Hereafter, the reading itself is the focus. Three book reading techniques are discussed and illustrated by classroom vignettes. Finally, based on an intervention program in which kindergartners were read a series <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> books, we report what we learned about the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> book reading on kindergartners’ performance in mathematics...|$|R

5|$|In 1931 Harry Cohn {{became the}} first studio head to {{implement}} the new unit production system, wherein producers were given specific responsibility over individual films, rather than supervising dozens <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> in a given year.

In 1932 Briskin went from assistant general manager, to general manager at Columbia, the announcement being made by in early June by Sam Cohn.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{some new}} {{operations}} and basic properties <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> fuzzy relations are intensively studied. First, a new inclusion relation (called type- 2 inclusion relation) <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> fuzzy relations is introduced, {{as well as}} the corresponding type- 2 union, type- 2 intersection and type- 2 complement operations. Second, the notions of anti-reflexive kernel, symmetric kernel, reflexive closure and symmetric closure <b>of</b> a <b>picture</b> fuzzy relation are introduced and their properties are explored. Moreover, a new method to solve picture fuzzy comprehensive evaluation problems is proposed by defining the new composition operation <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> fuzzy relations, and the picture fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is built. Finally, an application example (about investment risk) <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is given, and the effective experiment results are obtained...|$|R

5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo and Diana and Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E

5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} {{their share}} in Pliny's descriptions <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, {{the author of a}} work on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E

5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use <b>of</b> <b>pictures.</b> In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun a series <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy family environment, no doubt in accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E
