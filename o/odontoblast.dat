25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the <b>odontoblast</b> process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The <b>odontoblast</b> process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
500|$|Enamel {{is not a}} vital tissue, as {{it lacks}} blood vessels, nerves, and living cells. Consequently, {{pathologic}} processes involving only enamel, such as shallow cavities or cracks, tend to be painless. Dentin contains many microscopic tubes containing fluid and the processes of <b>odontoblast</b> cells, which communicate with the pulp. Mechanical, osmotic, or other stimuli cause movement of this fluid, triggering nerves in the pulp (the [...] "hydrodynamic theory" [...] of pulp sensitivity). Due to the close relationship between dentin and pulp, they are frequently considered together as the dentin-pulp complex.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOdontoblasts are {{responsible}} for the dentin formation. They are suspected {{to play a role in}} tooth pain transmission as sensor cells because of their close relationship with nerve, but this role has never been evidenced. We demonstrate here that human <b>odontoblasts</b> in vitro produce voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) currents in response to depolarization under voltage clamp conditions and are able to generate action potentials. <b>Odontoblasts</b> express neuronal isoforms of alpha 2 and beta 2 subunits of sodium channels. Co-cultures of <b>odontoblasts</b> with trigeminal neurons indicate a clustering of alpha 2 and beta 2 sodium channel subunits and, at the sites of cell-cell contact, a co-localization of <b>odontoblasts</b> beta 2 subunits with peripherin. In vivo, sodium channels are expressed in <b>odontoblasts.</b> Ankyrin(G) and beta 2 co-localize, suggesting a link for signal transduction between axons and <b>odontoblasts.</b> Evidence for excitable properties of <b>odontoblasts</b> and clustering of key molecules at the site of odontoblast-nerve contact strongly suggest that <b>odontoblasts</b> may operate as sensor cells that initiate tooth pain transmission...|$|R
2500|$|The {{adjacent}} layer of {{cells in the}} dental papilla suddenly increases in size and differentiates into <b>odontoblasts,</b> which are the cells that form dentin. Researchers believe that the <b>odontoblasts</b> would not form {{if it were not}} for the changes occurring in the IEE. As the changes to the IEE and the formation of <b>odontoblasts</b> continue from the tips of the cusps, the <b>odontoblasts</b> secrete a substance, an organic matrix, into their immediate surrounding. The organic matrix contains the material needed for dentin formation. [...] As <b>odontoblasts</b> deposit organic matrix termed predentin, they migrate toward the center of the dental papilla. Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward. Cytoplasmic extensions are left behind as the <b>odontoblasts</b> move inward. The unique, tubular microscopic appearance of dentin is a result of the formation of dentin around these extensions.|$|R
50|$|The {{protein is}} also {{produced}} by the <b>odontoblasts,</b> which are cells {{at the margins of}} the dental pulp. Reelin is found here both during odontogenesis and in the mature tooth. Some authors suggest that <b>odontoblasts</b> play an additional role as sensory cells able to transduce pain signals to the nerve endings. According to the hypothesis, reelin participates in the process by enhancing the contact between <b>odontoblasts</b> and the nerve terminals.|$|R
50|$|An <b>odontoblast</b> process (also called Tomes' fibers) is an {{extension}} of a cell called an <b>odontoblast,</b> which forms dentin in a tooth. The <b>odontoblast</b> process, also called Tomes fiber, is located in dentinal tubules. It forms during dentinogenesis and results from a part of the <b>odontoblast</b> staying in its location as {{the main body of the}} <b>odontoblast</b> moves toward the center of the tooth's pulp.

40|$|Background : <b>Odontoblasts</b> are {{the cells}} lining of tooth’s hard {{structure}} at the dentin-pulp border, which {{become the first}} cells encountered oral microorganisms entering dentin. However, they do not only form a physical barrier by producing dentin, but also provide an innate immune barrier for the tooth. Purpose : The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of <b>odontoblasts</b> in the innate immune response of the dental pulp. Reviews : Recent studies have proven that <b>odontoblasts</b> express toll-like receptors, and capable of producing chemokines (i. e. IL- 8, CCL 2, CXCL 2, and CXCL 10), and cytokines (IL- 1 β and TNF- α) following lipopolysacharide exposure. Thereby <b>odontoblasts</b> are actively participating in the recruitment of immune cells in response to caries–derived bacterial products. Furthermore, <b>odontoblasts</b> also produce antimicrobial peptides (hBD- 1, hBD- 2, and hBD- 3), and transform growth factor β that induce antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Conclusion : The presence of those innate immune molecules indicates that the nonspecific, natural, and rapidly acting defense may also be an important function of <b>odontoblasts.</b> </span...|$|R
50|$|<b>Odontoblasts</b> also secrete {{tertiary}} dentin when irritated.

This tertiary dentin is called reactionary dentin. This {{is an attempt}} to slow down the progress of the caries so that it does not reach the pulp.|$|R

50|$|Tertiary dentin is {{deposited}} {{at specific}} sites {{in response to}} injury by odontoblasts or replacement odontoblasts from the pulp depending on {{the severity of the}} injury. Tertiary dentin can be divided into reactionary or reparative dentin. Reactionary dentin is formed by odontoblasts when the injury does not damage the <b>odontoblast</b> layer. Reparative dentin is formed by replacement odontoblasts when the injury is so severe that it damages a part of the primary <b>odontoblast</b> layer. Thus a type of tertiary dentin forms in reaction to stimuli, such as attrition or dental caries.|$|E
5000|$|Korff fibers, also von Korff fibers are thick collageneous fibers in the {{developing}} tooth that begin in the dental papilla, spiral between {{the cells of the}} <b>odontoblast</b> layer, and form the matrix of the dentin. They are often the first sign of dentin formation. They are 0.1 to 0.2 µm in diameter and take a corkscrew path through the <b>odontoblast</b> layer and become incorporated into the layer of predentin.

Formation of tight junctions indicates {{the establishment of a}} distal membrane domain and maturation of <b>odontoblasts.</b> These events occur as mantle dentine formation ceases and circumpulpar dentine formation begins.

Abnormal <b>odontoblasts</b> exhibit strong bone sialoprotein expression but a decreased level of dentin sialophosphoprotein expression when compared with wild type <b>odontoblasts.</b> Loss of Nfic results in an increase in p-Smad 2 / 3 expression in aberrant <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp cells in the subodontoblastic layer in vivo and primary pulp cells from Nfic-deficient mice in vitro. Cell proliferation analysis of both cervical loop and ectomesenchymal cells of the Nfic-deficient mice revealed significantly decreased proliferative activity compared with wild type mice. In addition, Nfic-deficient primary pulp cells showed increased expression of p 21 and p 16 but decreased expression of cyclin D 1 and cyclin B 1, strongly suggesting cell growth arrest caused by a lack of Nfic activity. Analysis of the pulp and abnormal dentin in Nfic-deficient mice revealed an increase in apoptotic activity. Further, Nfic-deficient primary pulp cells exhibited an increase in caspase- 8 and - 3 activation, whereas the cleaved form of Bid was hardly detected. These results indicate that the loss of Nfic leads to the suppression of odontogenic cell proliferation and differentiation and induces apoptosis of aberrant <b>odontoblasts</b> during root formation, thereby contributing to the formation of short roots...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are {{expressed}} by <b>odontoblasts</b> and present in dentin. We hypothesized that <b>odontoblasts</b> express other collagen-degrading enzymes such as cysteine cathepsins, and their activity would {{be present in}} dentin, because <b>odontoblasts</b> are known to express at least cathepsin D. Effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on cathepsin expression was also analyzed. Methods: Human <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue were cultured with and without TGF-beta, and cathepsin gene expression was analyzed with DNA microarrays. Dentin cathepsin and MMP activities were analyzed by degradation of respective specific fluorogenic substrates. Results: Both <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue demonstrated {{a wide range of}} cysteine cathepsin expression that gave minor responses to TGF-beta. Cathepsin and MMP activities were observed in all dentin samples, with significant negative correlations in their activities with tooth age.

40|$|We {{recently}} reported {{the expression of}} podoplanin in the apical bud of adult mouse incisal tooth. This study was aimed to investigate the distribution of podoplanin-expressing cells in mouse tooth germs at several developing stages. At the bud stage podoplanin was expressed in oral mucous epithelia and in a tooth bud. At the cap stage podoplanin was expressed on inner and outer enamel epithelia but not in mesenchymal cells expressing the neural crest stem cell marker nestin.

5000|$|Tertiary dentin is dentin {{formed as}} a {{reaction}} to external stimulation such as cavities. It is of two types, either reactionary, where dentin is formed from a pre-existing <b>odontoblast,</b> or reparative, where newly differentiated odontoblast-like cells are formed due to the death of the original odontoblasts, from a pulpal progenitor cell. Tertiary dentin is only formed by an <b>odontoblast</b> directly affected by a stimulus; therefore, the architecture and structure depend on the intensity and duration of the stimulus, e.g., if the stimulus is a carious lesion, there is extensive destruction of dentin and damage to the pulp, due to the differentiation of bacterial metabolites and toxins. Thus, tertiary dentin is deposited rapidly, with a sparse and irregular tubular pattern and some cellular inclusions; in this case it is referred to as [...] "osteodentin". However, if the stimulus is less active, it is laid down less rapidly with a more regular tubular pattern and hardly any cellular inclusions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dentin {{formation}} in physiological and pathological conditions {{has been widely}} studied, but the events and regulation are still not completely understood. <b>Odontoblasts,</b> terminally differentiated post-mitotic cells located in a single cell layer around pulp tissue, synthesize and mineralize dentin organic matrix. Growth factors, such as TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2, have been implicated in the regulation of the responses of <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue to external irritation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of 28 endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading virtually all extracellular matrix components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) participate in the organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover and pathological tissue destruction in many tissues, but very {{little is known about}} their presence, function, and regulation in the dentin-pulp complex cells and tissues. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to analyze the expression and regulation of collagens, MMPs and TIMPs by TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 in mature human <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue. <b>Odontoblasts</b> synthesize and secrete type I and type III collagens, with no clear effect of TGF-β 1 on their expression levels. MMP- 1, - 2, - 8, - 9, - 10, - 11, - 14, - 15, - 16, - 19 and TIMP- 1, - 2, - 3 and - 4 were expressed by both <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue. MMP- 3 and MMP- 12 were not expressed in native <b>odontoblasts</b> or pulp tissue, and MMP- 7, - 24, and - 25 were expressed only in <b>odontoblasts.</b> MMP- 2, - 10, - 14, - 20 and - 23 were expressed more abundantly in <b>odontoblasts,</b> whereas pulp tissue expressed more MMP- 13 and MMP- 17. Growth factors differentially regulated the expression of different MMPs and TIMPs within and among the cells and tissues studied. In <b>odontoblasts,</b> MMP- 1, - 8 and - 14 were down-regulated, but MMP- 7, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3 up-regulated, by either TGF-β 1 or BMP- 2, alone or in combination. In pulp tissue, growth factors up-regulated the expression of MMP- 1, - 2, - 10, - 13, - 17 and TIMP- 3, but down-regulated TIMP- 4. The widespread of expression of MMPs and TIMPs by mature human <b>odontoblasts</b> and pulp tissue suggests that they may participate in dentin matrix organization prior to mineralization, and that growth factors may further control dentin matrix modeling, not by regulating the synthesis of type I or III collagens as previously believed, but rather by differentially regulating each MMPs and TIMPs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} correlations between dental pulp cell count of <b>odontoblasts,</b> subodontoblasts and fibroblasts and age, within different age groups. Formulation of regression equations using the dental pulp cell count for predicting age was attempted. Design: Eighty-one extracted teeth were grouped into two age groups (6 - 25 years, 26 - 80 years). The teeth were demineralized and histological sections were prepared for cell count. Regression equations were generated from regression analysis of cell count and tested for age estimation. Results: The number of dental pulp cells were found to increase until around the third decade of life and following this, the <b>odontoblasts</b> and subodontoblasts cell numbers began to decline while the fibroblasts seemed to remain almost stationary. The Pearson correlation test revealed a significant positive correlation between the cell number for all type of cells and age in the 6 - 25 years group (r = + 0. 791 for <b>odontoblasts,</b> r = + 0. 600 for subodontoblasts and r = + 0. 680 for fibroblasts). In the 26 - 80 years age group, a significant negative correlation of the <b>odontoblasts</b> (r = - 0. 777) and subodontoblasts (r = - 0. 715) with age was observed but for fibroblasts, the correlation value was negligible (r = - 0. 165).
