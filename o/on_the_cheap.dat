He has often been <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cheap</b> Seats. Following the World Series in 2010, a photo of Wilson celebrating with teammate Buster Posey appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Wilson also appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Lopez Tonight. He has frequently starred in commercials.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, the Australian fixie {{culture has}} been small. However, with the strong Australian dollar and cost {{effective}} manufacturing and importing from China, Australia has seen many new online stores capitalise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> steel frames commonly imported to the UK and US. Online stores in Australia ship partially-assembled bikes directly to consumers, considerably undercutting prices at typical brick and mortar stores.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{problems}} the Astros had in the late 1970s {{was that they were}} unable to compete in the free agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was still in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but {{they were not going to}} spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap.</b>|$|E

25|$|Signs {{of trouble}} were present {{even before the}} disappointing crowds {{filtered}} into their seats, as it was very apparent the team was cutting costs left and right. Not only was the pre-game video presentation done away with, but the board itself was not even turned on for the game. Advertising on the boards and field were {{for the most part}} bare, and the uniforms themselves clearly looked to be done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap.</b>|$|E
25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
500|$|The Inter City Firm {{were one}} of the first [...] "casuals", so called because they avoided police {{supervision}} by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular InterCity trains, rather than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> and more tightly policed [...] "football special" [...] charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm's moniker [...] "inter city" [...] suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.|$|E

50|$|The {{painting}} is large, but slightly {{smaller than the}} Primavera, and where that is a panel painting, this is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> support of canvas. Canvas was increasing in popularity, perhaps especially for secular paintings for country villas, which were decorated more simply, cheaply and cheerfully than those for city palazzi, being designed for pleasure more than ostentatious entertainment.|$|R
500|$|Professional {{concern was}} raised in several {{countries}} {{about the quality of}} memorials. Australians expressed critical concern from 1919 onwards about the poor quality of the sculptures of soldiers on memorials, the blame being placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> reproductions by stone masons. Their government responded by establishing advisory boards to discourage this trend. Britain also saw concerns over the [...] "stereotyped designs" [...] being supplied by firms of stone masons, and here again numerous bodies issued guidance on better practices, including the Royal Academy of Art, the Church of England; the Civic Arts Association was formed specifically to help. The opinion of professional artists and critics remained quite important for committees when choosing designs, however, and there was vigorous discussion between supporters of different styles and architectural traditions.|$|E
500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap.</b> Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|The di Suvero exhibit {{was removed}} {{at the end}} of October 2008. [...] In March 2009, the park {{announced}} its plans to install four large-scale contemporary outdoor works by Chinese sculptors in Boeing Galleries from April 9 – October 2010. [...] The exhibition, entitled [...] "A Conversation With Chicago: Contemporary Sculpture From China", complements [...] "The Big World: Recent Art From China" [...] exhibition hosted at the Chicago Cultural Center beginning April 25, 2009 but was conceived independently and is a distinct body of work. [...] Chen Wenling's [...] "Valiant Struggle No. 11," [...] symbolizes Chinese society. The open-work sculpture [...] "Windy City Dinosaur," [...] created by Sui Jianguo stamped with the phrase [...] "Made in China" [...] is a critique <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> mass-produced goods that are building the Chinese export economy. [...] "Kowtow Pump," [...] is a caricature of the oil rigs by Shen Shaomin that will have limited Thursday active display times from June 11 through Aug. 27. [...] Zhan Wang's [...] "Jia Shan Shi No. 46" [...] is considered the most abstract and depicts the scholar's rock in stainless steel.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} low- and modestly-budgeted noirs {{were made by}} independent, often actor-owned, {{companies}} contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like Pickup (1951) and The Other Woman (1954). It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s {{and much of the}} 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, The Hitch-Hiker (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO. It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: [...] Detour. Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the [...] "studio without a studio": Gun Crazy; Kiss Me Deadly; D.O.A. (1950), directed by Rudolph Maté and Sweet Smell of Success (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: Force of Evil (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s. Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but Sweet Smell of Success, despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap,</b> though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{also use}} an {{explanation}} of Gresham's Law as [...] "The more efficient you become, the less effective you get"; i.e. [...] "when you try to go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap,</b> you will stop selling" [...] or [...] "the less you invest in your non-tangible services, the fewer sales you will get." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{producers}} {{introduced a}} limit {{on the number of}} speaking parts in each episode due to budget cuts, with an average of 16 characters per episode. The decision was criticised by Martin McGrath of Equity, who said: [...] "Trying to produce quality TV <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> is doomed to fail." [...] The BBC responded by saying they had been working that way for some time and it had not affected the quality of the show.|$|E
50|$|In 1858 {{five hundred}} men, in two teams {{of two hundred}} fifty, a cosompolitan mix of British, Americans, Chinese, Mexicans, Scandinavians, Kanakas (Hawaiians), Germans and others {{signed up for the}} job. Controversy erupted at the end of {{construction}} over whether prices at the Port Douglas end of the trail or the more expensive rates at Lillooet would be used to reckon the reimbursement as promised.

2500|$|After having {{appeared}} {{as an instrument}} and place for isolating counterrevolutionary and criminal elements, the Gulag, because of its principle of [...] "correction by forced labor", quickly became, in fact, an independent branch of the national economy secured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> labor force presented by prisoners. Hence it is followed by one more important reason for the constancy of the repressive policy, namely, the state's interest in unremitting rates of receiving a cheap labor force that was forcibly used, mainly in the extreme conditions of the east and north. The Gulag possessed both punitive and economic functions.|$|E
2500|$|For about 23 years (approximately 1805-1830), Pierre and Marie Martin (née Breysee), {{kept the}} inn. [...] Originally poor farmers, {{they were said}} to have {{accumulated}} a fortune of 30,000 gold Francs (approximately 600,000 Euros in today's currency) by the time of their death. Pierre Martin was feared by his neighbours as he was a grasping, paid henchman of the local nobility, and had a forceful personality. [...] The Martins were ultra-royalists; he had assisted nobles returning from exile to recover their land from the farmers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap,</b> and she had hidden a refractory priest. [...] The political climate in France changed in 1830 with the overthrow of the ultra-royalist Charles X and his replacement by Louis Philippe: the Martins were no longer useful supporters of the regime but rather of its opponents.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{developed}} the heavy water moderated {{design in the}} post-World War II era to explore nuclear energy while lacking access to enrichment facilities. War-era enrichment systems were extremely expensive to build and operate, whereas the heavy water solution allowed the use of natural uranium in the experimental ZEEP reactor. A much less expensive enrichment system was developed, but the United States classified work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheaper</b> gas centrifuge process. The CANDU was therefore designed to use natural uranium.|$|R
2500|$|The band's roots {{lay in the}} {{hardcore}} {{scene of}} the early 1980s along with a strong influence from the British 2 Tone ska scene of the 1970s. Bassist Joe Gittleman played with local hardcore band Gang Green, while vocalist Dicky Barrett {{was a member of}} Impact Unit and, later <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cheap</b> Skates. The Cheap Skates lineup went through frequent changes and would feature members of Gang Green on occasion. It was through the Cheap Skates that a core lineup coalesced around Barrett, Gittleman, Tim [...] "Johnny Vegas" [...] Burton (saxophone), Nate Albert (guitar), Josh Dalsimer (drums), Tim Bridewell (trombone) and Ben Carr (a ubiquitous, dancing non-musician onstage presence, later credited as [...] "Bosstone"). The group decided on the name, [...] "the Bosstones" [...] as a reference to the city near their hometowns. While some of the band members were influenced by bands such as AC/DC, Social Distortion, Motörhead, The Clash and Stiff Little Fingers, Barrett had become enthralled with 2 Tone ska, which was in the tail end of its prominence.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the first}} mass-produced American {{passenger}} car with four-wheel-drive of any type, automotive industry analysts {{were taken by}} surprise {{at the fact that}} AMC, a company most had deemed past its ability to produce competitive vehicles, turned the best of what they had into a revolutionary, novel, and all-around competent vehicle. In doing so, the small American manufacturer was seen as having cleverly pioneered a new market segment - one that would grow wildly over the next 25 years and beyond, as evinced by Four Wheeler magazine's conclusion in 1980 that the new AMC Eagle was, indeed, [...] "The beginning {{of a new generation of}} cars." [...] Even as the automaker was struggling financially, [...] "AMC's reputation for developing vehicles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> is only exceeded by its legacy of midwifing the SUV", including the Eagle to be the precursor to one of the most popular vehicle types on the market. Indeed, the Eagle's basic concept - that of a station wagon with AWD, raised ground clearance, full range of power options and automatic transmissions, as well as rough-road capability - has inspired vehicles like the Subaru Outback and Forester lines, the Audi Allroad, the Volkswagen Passat Alltrack, the Volvo XC range, and many others. Similarly, motoring journalist Marty Padgett described AMC's car-based 1980 Eagle, combining all-weather capability with better gas mileage, as [...] "the first crossover," [...] that was succeeded by whole generations of Subaru vehicles and other models.|$|E
