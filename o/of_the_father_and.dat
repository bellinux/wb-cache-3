5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears {{that if there were}} two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>and</b> the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E

5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard with hair strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E

The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the Son is eternal and begotten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>and</b> the Holy Spirit is eternal and proceeds from the Father.

They encountered at least eight fleeing gunmen. There followed a gunfight lasting twenty minutes in which at least two hundred shots were fired. There were no casualties among the security forces but the gunmen escaped.

25|$|The Father is the eternal, {{infinite}} and uncreated reality, {{that the}} Christ and the Holy Spirit are also eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin {{is not in}} the ousia of God, but that their origin is in the hypostasis of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance to the teachings of Macedonius I of Constantinople and his sect called the Pneumatomachians in that the Holy Spirit is created by the Son and a servant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> the Son. It was Macedonius' position that caused the specific wording of the section on the Holy Spirit by St Gregory of Nyssa in the finalized Nicene creed.|$|E
25|$|Moltmann relates {{his views}} on the trinity to three modes of human freedom. The first mode is the {{political}} meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode is rejected by Moltmann, who sees it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation of a subject with an object, where {{the goal is to}} enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of human freedom is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favors. The third mode of human freedom is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God {{in the realm of the}} Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans to be friends with God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom is political, and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.|$|E
