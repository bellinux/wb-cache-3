5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would have witnessed the formation of a county administration and a loss of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> Local Government Act 1888.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness.

Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the {{rendezvous}} point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E

5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> and indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio and the Rapture. In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun Pickups delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. Until the freeway is complete, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future, and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a Pairwise Aggregated Hierarchical Analysis of Ratio-Scale Preferences (PAHAP), a new method for solving {{discrete}} alternative multicriteria decision problems. Following the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), PAHAP uses pairwise preference judgments to assess <b>the</b> relative attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> By first aggregating the pairwise judgment ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> across all criteria, and then synthesizing based on these aggregate measures, PAHAP determines overall ratio scale priorities and rankings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> which {{are not subject to}} rank reversal, provided that certain weak consistency requirements are satisfied. Hence, PAHAP can serve as a useful <b>alternative</b> to <b>the</b> original AHP if rank reversal is undesirable, for instance when the system is open and criterion scarcity does not affect <b>the</b> relative attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> single matrix <b>of</b> pairwise aggregated ratings constructed in PAHAP provides useful insights into the decision maker's preference structure. PAHAP requires the same preference information as the original AHP (or, altematively, the same information as the Referenced AHP, if the criteria are compared based on average (total) value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives).</b> As it is easier to implement and interpret than previously proposed variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional AHP which prevent rank reversal, PAHAP also appears attractive from a practitioner's viewpoint...|$|R
