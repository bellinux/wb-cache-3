And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on.

[...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E

2500|$|In July 1992, Morrissey {{released}} the album Your Arsenal, which peaked at number 2 in the album chart. It {{was the final}} release from producer Mick Ronson; Morrissey related that working with Ronson had been [...] "the greatest privilege of my life". Your Arsenal reflected Morrissey's lament for what he regarded as the decline of British culture {{in the face of}} increasing Americanisation. He told one interviewer that [...] "everything is informed by American culture - everyone under fifty speaks American - and that's sad. We once had a strong identity and now that's gone completely". A number of the tracks on the album, most notably [...] "Certain People I Know" [...] and [...] "The National Front Disco", dealt with the lives and experiences of tough, working-class youths. Your Arsenal was critically well received, and often described as his best album since Viva Hate. The first single, [...] "We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful", had been released in April 1992 and peaked at number 17; this was followed by [...] "Certain People I Know", which reached number 34, and [...] "You're the <b>One</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me,</b> Fatty", which reached number 19. From September to December, Morrissey embarked on a 53-date Your Arsenal tour in which he varyingly decorated the stage with backdrops of Diana Dors, Elvis Presley, and Charlie Richardson. One of the performances was recorded and released as Beethoven Was Deaf.|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} the season behind Rosberg, Hamilton had won the four preceding rounds of the season, converting a 29-point deficit into a 17-point lead over his teammate heading into the Austin race. With three races left in the season, Hamilton said he would prioritise not allowing any negative thoughts concerning double-points in the season-closing event in Abu Dhabi bother him and would take any opportunities he was presented with: [...] "We've just got to do our due diligence and work as hard as we can to make sure we don't have any problems." [...] Hamilton hoped to achieve his fifth consecutive victory of the year: [...] "A lot of the American side of my family come to the race, plus I won the first F1 GP at the circuit back in 2012 - it's a special <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I really enjoy going there and I'm looking forward to another great race." [...] Rosberg was aiming to improve on his best finish in Austin (ninth in 2013) and to further reduce Hamilton's advantage in the Driver's Championship. He said Mercedes were targeting [...] "a big finish" [...] to their season, while also declaring he would not concede defeat until the final round of the season, and hoped to maintain the level of entertainment for the sport's fan base: [...] "The first step comes in Austin, which is a really cool city and a great race track. I haven't had the best races there so far, but I'm determined to change that this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big <b>one</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm {{not going to get into}} the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E
