It was some time before the boatmen could be assembled, and ere they were well embarked, and ready to depart, the pale moon was come over the hill, and flinging a trembling reflection on the broad and glittering waves. But so soft and pleasant was the night, that Butler, in bidding farewell to Jeanie, had no apprehension for her safety; and what is yet more extraordinary, Mrs. Dolly felt no alarm for her own. The air was soft, and came <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> wave with something of summer fragrance.

50|$|New {{emerging}} technology utilize the Peltier effect of semi-conducting materials {{in which one}} side of the semi-conducting material heats while the other side cools. In this application, air is forced <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> fins on the side that cools which lowers the temperature of the air to its dew point, causing water to condense. The resulting water is then collected. Due to the solid-state nature of the semi-conducting material and the lower power usage, some of these new designs use solar energy panels as the power source.|$|E

50|$|However, many window {{air conditioners}} are {{designed}} to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the cooling coils. To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that {{most or all of}} the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, the Kuroshio took a large meander path south of Japan {{for the first time}} since 1991, and this large meander event persisted until the next summer. Satellite {{observations}} and numerical model simulations are used to study the effect of this large meander event on the atmosphere. The large meander leaves a cool water pool between the Kuroshio and Japanese coast. Sea surface temperature (SST) in <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> water pool is about 2 - 3 o C colder than the surroundings during winter and spring while the SST signature substantially weakens in summer. A local reduction of wind speed is found <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> water pool, and the positive SST-wind speed correlation is indicative of ocean forcing of the atmosphere. Cloud liquid water (CLW) content and precipitation also decrease <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cool</b> SST pool. A regional atmospheric model successfully simulates atmospheric response to the Kuroshio large meander. The model experiments suggest that the reduced surface wind speed and precipitation are due to the large meander-induced SST <b>cooling.</b> Analysis of <b>the</b> surface perturbation momentum budgets shows the importance of the pressure adjustment mechanism in surface wind response to the cold SST anomalies. ...|$|R

40|$|Oxidation {{characteristics}} of a microalloyed low carbon steel were investigated by a hot rolling mill combined with acceleration cooling system <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> rate range from 20 to 70 °C/s. The effects of cooling rate after hot rolling on microstructure and phase composition of oxide scale were examined.

A higher cooling rate promotes the formation of retain wustite and primary magnetite precipitation while suppression of eutectoid α-iron precipitates. This provides the possibility to enhance potential contribution of magnetite precipitates with preferable ductility, and hence fabricates a desired oxide-scale structure under continuous post cooling conditions considering a suitable cooling rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for validating low-energy whole building simulations is expounded in this paper. The {{capability of the}} integrated building-plant system, modeled by means of equation-based environment (IDA ICE), is evaluated to quantify model mismatch. A unique “energy concept” building is considered, and consists of various low-exergy technologies: suspended ceiling panels with phase change material (PCM), radiant cooling by plastered capillary tubes, borehole heat exchanger, and free night ventilation. Monitoring data is used to validate the model <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> season, and results showed accurate prediction by both the building and plant models (Pfafferot 2003). The primary outcome {{of this research is}} the complete, integrated realization of a low-energy whole building simulation with validation results, whereas comparable "energy concept" validation studies are scarce. Furthermore, the high accuracy of the approach lends itself to optimization of low-energy buildings, the investigation and demostration of alternative cooling strategies, and in support of the constuction of such buildings...|$|E

In addition, the influences on torque and power performances by the cooling ducts made in the housing or stator back are evaluated by JMAG model. The directly cooled motors show lower temperature rises at the stator back since the direct contact between coolant and stator back can avoid the unnecessary thermal contact resistances between the stator back and housing, meanwhile make the coolant more close to the heat sources, and thus improve the cooling efficiency...|$|E

40|$|A design {{strategy}} is presented that can enable a typical new {{home to be}} heated, cooled, and ventilated with less than 400 cfm of delivered air. The strategy has three major elements. First, peak cooling loads are minimized by using good available technologies for the envelope, with emphasis on minimizing heat gains through the windows. Second, the envelope is designed to have very low natural air leakage rates, such that all the ventilation air can be drawn in at one point and passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> coil before it is mixed with the house air. This permits {{a significant portion of}} the cooling load to be met at an air flow rate of {approximately} 200 cubic feet per minute (cfm) per ton, compared with the typical 400 cfm per ton in standard air-conditioning systems. Third, by reducing the amount of supply air needed to meet the envelope loads, the required size of ductwork is reduced, making it easier to locate the ducts within the conditioned space. This reduces duct loads to zero, completing the three-part energy conserving strategy...|$|E
40|$|A self-consistent {{solution}} of the thermodynamic structure of an H 2 O-dominated multispecies cometary atmosphere at 1 AU is obtained by solving the simultaneous set of differential equations representing conservation of number density, momentum, energy, and the flux of solar UV radiation in the three streams responsible for the major photolytic processes. The relative efficiency of the expansion and infrared cooling by H 2 O over the photolytic heating by the UV radiation in the inner coma brings about a rapid decrease in the temperature there, reaching a minimum of only about 5. 4 K at a nuclear distance of approximately 54 km. Thereafter, the temperature is found to increase to about 810 K at a nuclear distance of 25, 000 km, owing to higher efficiency of the photolytic heating <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> process. The expansion in the inner coma is seen to be highly supersonic, attaining a maximum Mach number of about 15 at the distance of temperature minimum. After that, the Mach number steadily decreases, reaching a value of about 2. 3 at a nuclear distance of 25, 000 km...|$|E
40|$|Space {{conditioning}} represents nearly 50 % {{of average}} residential household energy consumption, highlighting {{the need to}} identify alternative cost-effective, energy-efficient cooling and heating strategies. As homes are better built, there is an increasing need for strategies that are particularly well suited for high performance, low load homes. ARBI researchers worked with two test homes in hot-dry climates to evaluate the in-situ performance of air-to-water heat pump (AWHP) systems, an energy efficient space conditioning solution designed to cost-effectively provide comfort in homes with efficient, safe, and durable operation. Two monitoring projects of test houses in hot-dry climates were initiated in 2010 to test this system. Both systems were fully instrumented and have been monitored over one year to capture complete performance data <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> and heating seasons. Results are used to quantify energy savings, cost-effectiveness, and system performance using different operating modes and strategies.

500|$|The red wattlebird {{appears to}} be a {{permanent}} resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known. It {{appears to be}} partly migratory in Western Australia and the north coast of New South Wales. In southeastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it appears to move to lower altitudes for winter. For instance, birds vacate <b>the</b> Brindabella Range <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> months. Overall, little pattern is discernible in the species' movements, though red wattlebirds appear to move to feed on populations of flowering banksias and eucalypts, such as winter-flowering banksias in Perth <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooler</b> months. Large numbers arrive in [...] time to feed on flowering native apples (Angophora) in Mudgee and Cobbora districts in central-western New South Wales, and on white box (Eucalyptus albens) at Barrington in central-northern New South Wales. A mainly resident population on the Swan Coastal Plain north of Perth is supplemented during winter by more arriving from inland areas. South of Perth, red wattlebirds are more locally nomadic, moving to new patches of blooming wildflowers. East of Perth in areas around Kellerberin, Kwolyin and Nangeenan, the red wattlebird is present from late autumn to spring, breeding in August and September. Around Lake Grace, the red wattlebird is present year-round.|$|R

40|$|London’s urban heat island {{increases}} the mean air temperature which affects {{the demand for}} heating and cooling buildings. Measured air temperature data {{have been used as}} input to a building energy simulation computer program to assess the heating and cooling load of a typical air-conditioned office building positioned at 24 different locations within the London Heat Island. It is found that the urban cooling load is up to 25 % higher than the rural load over the year, and the annual heating load is reduced by 22 %. The effect of raised temperature and urban context are assessed separately, and the sensitivity of the net impact to the internal gains in a building is determined. For the estimation of peak cooling demand, we propose hourly temperature corrections based on radial distance from London’s centre to be applied to standard published temperatures for the region. For more detailed investigations <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> season a range of models is available.

40|$|Advanced hybrid {{cooling loop}} {{technology}} has been developed for the high performance cooling systems for such as U. S. Army next generation vehicles, “Future Combat System (FCS) ” and Directed Energy Weapons (DEW), high power Solid State Laser Systems. The hybrid cooling loop combines the active liquid pumping with the passive capillary liquid management in the sintered wick structure of the evaporator and its liquid/vapor separation. The prototype hybrid cooling loop using planar evaporator design was tested {{to be capable of}} managing up to 4 kW cooling load which is equivalent to the heat flux up to 30 W/cm <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> surface area of 135 cm (= 7. 6 cm× 17. 8 cm). From the temperature results, however, much higher heat flux conditions are very likely to be achieved. The measured boiling thermal resistance was as low as 0. 16 °C-cm/W and remained relatively constant during heat load variations except cold start conditions. This paper discusses the operating principle of the hybrid cooling loop with single evaporator and presents the test results under various power cycles. The results represent major improvements over the state-of-art heat pipes, loop heat pipes and two-phase spray and jet impingement cooling devices in terms of heat flux, cooling surface area and design simplicity.

40|$|The {{cool white}} dwarf SDSS J 124231. 07 + 522626. 6 {{exhibits}} photospheric absorption lines of 8 distinct heavy elements in medium resolution optical spectra, notably including oxygen. The Teff = 13000 K atmosphere is helium-dominated, but the convection zone contains {{significant amounts of}} hydrogen and oxygen. The four most common rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, and Fe) account for almost all the accreted mass, totalling at least 1. 2 e+ 24 g, similar to the mass of Ceres. The time-averaged accretion rate is 2 e+ 10 g/s, {{one of the highest}} rates inferred among all known metal-polluted white dwarfs. We note a large oxygen excess, with respect to the most common metal oxides, suggesting that the white dwarf accreted planetary debris with a water content of ~ 38 per cent by mass. This star, together with GD 61, GD 16, and GD 362, form a small group of outliers from the known population of evolved planetary systems accreting predominantly dry, rocky debris. This result strengthens the hypothesis that, integrated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> ages of white dwarfs, accretion of water-rich debris from disrupted planetesimals may significantly contribute to the build-up of trace hydrogen observed in a large fraction of helium-dominated white dwarf atmospheres.

40|$|The {{response}} of the Southern Ocean to a repeating seasonal cycle of ozone loss is studied in two coupled climate models and found to comprise both fast and slow processes. The fast response {{is similar to the}} inter-annual signature of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on Sea Surface Temperature (SST), on to which the ozone-hole forcing projects in the summer. It comprises enhanced northward Ekman drift inducing negative summertime SST anomalies around Antarctica, earlier sea ice freeze-up the following winter, and northward expansion of the sea ice edge year-round. The enhanced northward Ekman drift, however, results in upwelling of warm waters from below the mixed layer in the region of seasonal sea ice. With sustained bursts of westerly winds induced by ozone-hole depletion, this warming from below eventually dominates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> from anomalous Ekman drift. The resulting slow-timescale response (years to decades) leads to warming of SSTs around Antarctica and ultimately a reduction in sea-ice cover year-round. This two-timescale behavior - rapid cooling followed by slow but persistent warming - is found in the two coupled models analysed, one with an idealized geometry, the other a complex global climate model with realistic geometry. Processes that control the timescale of the transition from cooling to warming, and their uncertainties are described. Finally we discuss the implications of our results for rationalizing previous studies of the effect of the ozone-hole on SST and sea-ice extent. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{handful of}} white dwarfs with helium-dominated atmospheres contain {{exceptionally}} large masses of hydrogen in their convection zones, with the metal-polluted white dwarf GD 16 {{being one of}} the earliest recognised examples. We report the discovery of a similar star: the white dwarf coincidentally named GD 17. We obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy of both GD 16 and GD 17 and calculated abundances and accretion rates of photospheric H, Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe and Ni. The metal abundance ratios indicate that the two stars recently accreted debris which is Mg-poor compared to the composition of bulk Earth. However, unlike the metal pollutants, H never diffuses out of the atmosphere of white dwarfs and we propose that the exceptionally high atmospheric H content of GD 16 and GD 17 (2. 2 × 10 ^ 24 g and 2. 9 × 10 ^ 24 g respectively) could result from previous accretion of water bearing planetesimals. Comparing the detection of trace H and metal pollution among 729 helium atmosphere white dwarfs, we find that the presence of H is nearly twice as common in metal-polluted white dwarfs compared to their metal-free counterparts. This highly significant correlation indicates that, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> age of the white dwarfs, at least some fraction of the H detected in many He atmospheres (including GD 16 and GD 17) is accreted alongside metal pollutants, where the most plausible source is water. In this scenario, water must be common in systems with rocky planetesimals. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

Spectra obtained using OSIRIS on the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) show DES 14 X 3 taz is a SLSN-I at z= 0. 608. Multi-color photometry reveals a double-peaked light curve: a blue and relatively bright initial peak that fades rapidly prior to the slower rise of the main light curve.
