40|$|We {{conducted}} {{experiments in}} a wind tunnel with Mach number 2 {{to explore the}} evolution of a transverse plasma jet and its modification effect on a shock wave induced by a ramp with an angle of 24 Â°. The transverse plasma jet was created by arc discharge in a small cylindrical cavity with a 2 â¯mm diameter orifice. Three group tests with different actuator arrangements in the spanwise or streamwise direction upstream from the ramp were respectively studied to compare their disturbances to the shock wave. As shown by a time-resolved schlieren system, an unsteady motion of the shock wave by actuation was found: the shock wave was significantly modified by the plasma jet with an upstream motion and a reduced angle. Compared to spanwise actuation, a more intensive impact was obtained with two or three streamwise actuators working together. From shock wave structures, the control effect <b>of</b> the plasma <b>jet</b> on the shock motion based on a thermal effect, a potential cause of shock modification, was discussed. Furthermore, we performed a numerical simulation by using the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) method to simulate the evolution of the transverse plasma jet plume produced by two streamwise actuators. The results show that flow structures are similar to those identified in schlieren images. Two streamwise vortices were recognized, which indicates that the higher jet plume is the result <b>of</b> the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> two streamwise <b>jets.</b> Keywords: Flow control, Improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) method, Plasma synthetic jet, Shock wave/boundary layer interaction, Time resolved schlieren syste...|$|R

40|$|Even though jet {{grouting}} technology has noticeably progressed {{since the first}} applications, and treatment efficiency has accordingly improved, {{there is still a}} great level of uncertainty on the results of treatment, in terms of both column diameter and mechanical properties of cemented material. This paper focuses on the estimate of the average diameter, which {{is by far the most}} important geometrical parameter <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> grouted columns at the design stage: it is fundamental for <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> adjacent columns in linear barriers and massive treatments, but plays a still important role in reinforcements made with isolated columns. In principle, the diameter of a column is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the injected fluids and on the physical and mechanical properties of soils, being the result of a very complex interaction between these two elements. Comprehensive analyses of these mechanisms have been rarely attempted, but several studies can be found in the literature trying to establish relations, on empirical or sound theoretical basis, between diameters and injection parameters or soil properties.

For generation of high interfacial area breaking <b>of</b> liquid <b>jet</b> in to small droplet is necessary. Liquid jet breakup is a complex phenomenon and dependent on many factors like velocity <b>of</b> <b>jet,</b> pressure difference, geometry of nozzle, temperature of both fluid, properties of fluid like their density, viscosity,surface tension, vapor pressure etc. Here different characteristics <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> are discussed. The most important parameter for this phenomenon is the Weber number (We) calculated from {{the diameter of the}} large structures. Indeed, the main parameters that can affect the secondary atomization are acceleration of drop by external flow, shear due to the differential speed between liquid and gas and surface tension. In this paper different aspect <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> behavior like jet length, flow regions <b>of</b> free turbulent <b>jet,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> disintegration, effect <b>of</b> different variables on liquid jet breakup, etc. are discussed.

40|$|Travelling {{sprinkler}} systems usually use a large volume gun-sprinkler that requires high operating pressure. These sprinklers deliver water at high application rates with large drops that can damage plants and destroy soil surface structure {{and in some}} cases lead to surface sealing which, in turn, reduces soil infiltration and leads to an increase in runoff. They can also be characterised as having low application uniformity, especially in windy conditions. The use of a line with medium- or low-pressure sprinklers, mounted on the system-moving vehicle, instead of the gun-sprinkler, can be an alternative to the use of traveller systems in some crops and topographic conditions. Smaller sprinklers require less operating pressure, the water drops are smaller and the <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> water <b>jets</b> can increase irrigation uniformity. Field tests were used to compare the performance of the traveller machine using a line of four sprinklers (250 kPa) and a gun-sprinkler (350 kPa), at three different travelling speeds, corresponding to three different application depths. The evaluated parameters were: irrigation uniformity, evaporation and wind drift losses, runoff and sediment yield. With wind speeds between 14 and 40 m/s, the traveller with the line of sprinklers allowed better irrigation uniformity for all travelling speeds. Evaporation and wind drift losses were similar for both system options, presenting significant differences only for the lowest machine velocity. Runoff increased along the irrigation events, with the gun-sprinkler option presenting higher values. However, due to some variations in the soil water content and water depths that occurred in the field tests, {{it was not possible to}} prove that the significant differences observed were caused only as a result of the use of a different system option. Sediment yield was higher in the events with the gun-sprinkler due to higher amounts of runoff and more soil detachment by the larger drops of this system option. From these field tests it is possible to state that the line of sprinklers option has some management disadvantages compared to the gun-sprinkler option. It is more labour intensive, and its height from the soil can be a limiting factor for use with some crops. In cases where its use does not interfere with the crop canopy it can allow irrigations with higher performance. It can also be used as an alternative for the first irrigation events, especially in poor-structured soils that present more crust formation problems...|$|R
