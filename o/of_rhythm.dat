5|$|Characteristics of Dominican music {{include the}} West African use of call and {{response}} singing, clapping {{as a major}} part <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> and lyrical, dance and rhythmic improvisation. Lyrics are almost all in Dominican Creole French, and are traditionally sung by women (chantwèl), while the instrumental traditions are predominantly practiced by men. Drums, generically known as lapo kabwit, are the most prominent part of Dominica's instrumental tradition.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Ali was {{strongly}} influenced by Elmo Hope, and his playing was rapid and intense, retaining a sense <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> even when his style became increasingly unconventional. Several recordings of his playing may exist, but only one – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – has been released. Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia, where he influenced musicians including John Coltrane, but he remained little known elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>rhythm,</b> English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000265291700002 International audienceDevelopment {{involves}} {{interactions between}} genetic and environmental influences. Vertebrate mothers are generally the first individuals to encounter {{and interact with}} young animals. Thus, their role is primordial during ontogeny. The present study evaluated non-genomic effects of mothers on the development <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> precocial Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). First, we investigated the influence of mothering on the ontogeny <b>of</b> endogenous <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> young. We compared circadian and ultradian <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> feeding activity of quail reared with or without adoptive mothers. More brooded than non-brooded quail presented a circadian and/or an ultradian rhythm. Thus, {{the presence of the}} mother during the normal brooding period favors, in the long term, expression <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the young. Second, we investigated the influence of rhythmic phenotype of the mother on the development <b>of</b> endogenous <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> young by comparing quail brooded by circadian-rhythmic adoptive mothers (R) to quail brooded by circadian-arrhythmic adoptive mothers (A). More R-brooded than A-brooded quail expressed circadian rhythmicity, and circadian rhythm clarities were greater in R-brooded than A-brooded quail. Ultradian rhythmicity did not differ between R- and A-brooded quail, nor between R and A adoptive mothers. Thus, the rhythmic phenotypes of quail mothers influence the rhythmic phenotypes of their young. Our results demonstrate that mothers of precocial birds influence epigenetically the ontogeny <b>of</b> endogenous <b>rhythms</b> <b>of</b> the young they raise...|$|R
5|$|Mullen {{is said to}} have a preternatural sense <b>of</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Brian Eno recounted {{that while}} working with Mullen on a U2 album, Mullen kept insisting that the click track was off and lagging behind the tracks that had already been recorded.

5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E

5|$|In September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger were classmates at Wentworth Primary School, Dartford. In 1954, Jagger {{passed the}} eleven-plus {{and went to}} Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre, named after its most famous alumnus, {{installed}} within the school's site. Jagger and Richards lost {{contact with each other}} when they went to different schools, but after a chance encounter on platform two at Dartford railway station in July 1960, resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> and blues, which for Jagger had begun with Little Richard.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E

30|$|In our view, a territoriological {{continuation}} of rhythmanalysis seems more promising since it enables a study <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> together with melodies and refrains, i.e., {{it allows for}} a study <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> by means <b>of</b> the spatio-temporal processes and contexts through which rhythms come alive and take on meanings. A territorological perspective points towards the study of de/territorialisation, de/singularisation of territorial sorts {{as well as the}} spatio-temporal expression of properties in the form of affections and operative relations that enable territorial formation to carry and convey social meaning. Rhythms are never encountered as abstract entities, but are always produced in complex processes of territorialisation. It would thus make sense to advance the study <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> through in-depth investigations of spatio-temporal intensities and presences, instead <b>of</b> paralysing dichotomies. <b>Rhythms</b> are an inherent part of living intensities, social interactions and formations of meaning.|$|R
5|$|Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), mixed {{rock and}} {{electronic}} music with lyrics {{inspired by the}} War on Terror, and was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration <b>of</b> <b>rhythm,</b> was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{original}} repertoire consisted <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> {{and blues}} covers, but after Zappa joined the band he {{encouraged them to}} play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from rhythm and blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced rock to orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans and cries. However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E
5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation <b>of</b> <b>rhythm</b> and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{dementia}} {{have been shown}} to have disturbed sleep/wake rhythms. There is evidence of impairment in endogenous generation <b>of</b> <b>rhythms</b> and deficient environmental cues in this population. This study sought to examine patterns <b>of</b> rest/activity <b>rhythms</b> as they relate to dementia severity. Three days of actigraphy were collected from 150 nursing-home patients {{with dementia}} and used to compute rhythm parameters. Dementia severity was estimated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The relationship between rhythm parameters and dementia severity was examined. Rhythm parameters were not associated with dementia in the sample as a whole, but relationships emerged when the sample was divided on the basis <b>of</b> overall <b>rhythm</b> robustness (F-statistic). Within the group with less robust rhythms, those with stronger rhythms had less severe dementia. In the group with more robust rhythms, milder dementia was associated with having an earlier acrophase (timing of the peak <b>of</b> the <b>rhythm)</b> and narrower peak <b>of</b> the <b>rhythm</b> (shorter duration <b>of</b> peak activity). These results suggested a three-stage model <b>of</b> rest/activity <b>rhythm</b> changes in dementia in which dementia patients have a rapid decline in rhythmicity followed by a slight return to stronger rhythms.
