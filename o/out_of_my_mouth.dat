As reproduced in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison's original lyrics carried the title [...] "WHENEVER (by Shirley Bassey)". He recalls in the book: [...] "I got the chord sequence, and 'When every song is sung' were the first words to come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and it developed from there." ...|$|E
500|$|Since her {{breakout}} with Pink Friday, Minaj {{has been}} involved in a feud with rapper Lil' Kim, who accused Minaj of copying her style. Although Minaj's [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] was thought to be directed at Kim, she said she was [...] "talking about everyone who has been in interviews talking ... no one is worth being singled out. No one is worth having their name mentioned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and they never will get that." [...] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday; a fragment from Minaj's diss track, [...] "Tragedy", previewed that April. Their conflict sparked a feud between Minaj and rapper Foxy Brown, who said Minaj misrepresented their conversation about Kim. Brown released the diss tracks [...] "Hold Yuh" [...] and [...] "Massacre" [...] (directed at Kim and Minaj) in November 2010 and January 2011, respectively, but Brown and Minaj settled their dispute in June 2012.|$|E
500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> didn't they? [...] Just wait and see what happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys {{look at her and}} say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, love, independence, and {{maturity}} became reoccurring themes throughout the album. With {{songs such as}} [...] "'I'm Still in Love with My Ex" [...] and [...] "Better Without You" [...] inspired by Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams, most of the tracks Rowland recorded were relationship-driven, something {{she said she was}} not hesitant about discussing. [...] "I just went in the studio and just did me, because I think that's when you get your best product. That's when it's just natural. It just flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and came out in lyrics [...] I had great writers involved." [...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals. I love her. I love Beyoncé's voice, and I love Brandy. Those are three vocalists who inspire me. I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level." ...|$|E

5000|$|Campbell {{produced}} the remake of The Evil Dead, along with Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert. Campbell made an appearance that may allude to his signature character, Ash, {{with the expectation}} he would reprise that role in Army of Darkness 2.

5000|$|Raimi {{confirmed}} {{plans to}} write Evil Dead 4 with his brother; {{it was later}} specified that this film would be Army of Darkness 2. At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell stated that their ultimate plan was for Evil Dead 2 and Raimi's Army of Darkness 2 {{to be followed by}} a crossover film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia. Campbell had confirmed to reprise his Ash role in Army of Darkness 2. On October 26, Alvarez confirmed on his Twitter that Sam Raimi will be directing Army of Darkness 2.

60|$|The side of {{the ship}} made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea. But I saw at once {{something}} elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder. Before I could form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light, which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man, flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive, silent play of summer lightning in a night sky. With a gasp I saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet, the long legs, a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow. One hand, awash, clutched the bottom rung of the ladder. He was complete but for the head. A headless corpse! The cigar dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gaping <b>mouth</b> with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven. At that I suppose he raised up his face, a dimly pale oval {{in the shadow of the}} ship's side. But even then I could only barely make out down there the shape of his black-haired head. However, it was enough for the horrid, frost-bound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off. The moment of vain exclamations was past, too. I only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as I could, to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside.|$|R

Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz stated categorically: [...] "There is no use of chemical weapons and no necessity of using them." [...] The casualties were declared [...] "chemical martyrs" [...] by the Kurds. International response at the time was muted. The United States intelligence and government suggested that Kurdish civilians were not a deliberate target, and even that Iran was indeed responsible. A briefing paper by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated: [...] "We believe it better to maintain a dialogue with others if we want to influence their actions. Punitive measures such as unilateral sanctions would not be effective in changing Iraq's behaviour over chemical weapons, and would damage British interests to no avail." ...|$|R
