5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an <b>operculum),</b> overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the <b>operculum,</b> which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the <b>operculum</b> further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the <b>operculum</b> with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified <b>operculum</b> of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the <b>operculum</b> are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the <b>operculum,</b> which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis, {{common name}} the river nerite, is {{a species of}} small {{freshwater}} and brackish water snail with a gill and an <b>operculum,</b> an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Neritidae, the nerites.|$|E
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the <b>operculum,</b> forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified <b>operculum.</b> The coloration {{pattern on the}} shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water, in rivers and lakes on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864â€“1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped <b>operculum</b> into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (<b>operculum)</b> opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an <b>operculum,</b> and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E
5|$|The {{external}} {{anatomy of}} the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that}} of other strombid snails. The animal has an elongate snout, thin eyestalks with well-developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong foot with a sickle-shaped <b>operculum.</b> A molecular analysis conducted in 2006 based on DNA sequences of histone and mitochondrial genes demonstrated that Laevistrombus canarium, Doxander vittatus and Labiostrombus epidromis are closely related species. The dog conch exhibits behaviours common among Strombidae, including burrowing and a characteristic leaping form of locomotion. The former behaviour, however, involves movement sequences unique to this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an <b>operculum</b> on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of <b>operculum</b> have been observed. In a {{specimen}} from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering <b>operculum</b> flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous <b>operculum</b> is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped <b>operculum,</b> which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into thinking they had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature {{as to whether or not}} this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a radula comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, <b>operculum</b> and radula, he concluded that L.turturella was simply a morphotype, and therefore a synonym of L.canarium.|$|E
5|$|They did, however, {{have certain}} traits {{separating}} them from cartilaginous fishes, traits {{that would become}} pivotal {{in the evolution of}} terrestrial forms. With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony <b>operculum,</b> with a single opening to the exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as anchoring for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an anchoring for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint {{at the base of the}} fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight bearing structure in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a swim bladder/lung, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} the <b>operculum</b> is light horn. The <b>operculum</b> is corneus, spirally multivolute, {{slightly}} produced posteriorly {{to conform to the}} shape of the aperture.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} radioles, called an <b>operculum,</b> {{is a highly}} {{specialized}} structure located on the dorsal part of the head. The <b>operculum</b> consists of a long, thick stalk with a cartilaginous, cone-shaped plug at the distal end. This plug {{can be used to}} seal the opening of the tube after the animal has retreated inside. The <b>operculum,</b> which is usually red in color, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two opercula. Both serpulid and sabellid worms have radioles, but sabellids (such as Sabella pavonina) lack an <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inhabits New Zealand, {{in fresh}} water. Shell ovate, acute, subperforated (generally {{covered with a}} brown earthy coat); whorls rather rounded, mouth ovate, axis 3 lines; <b>operculum</b> horny and subspiral: variety, spire rather longer, whorls more rounded. This species is like Paludina nigra of Quoy and Gaimard, but the <b>operculum</b> is more spiral. Quoy {{described}} the <b>operculum</b> as concentric, but figured it subspiral. Paludina ventricosa of Quoy is evidently a Nematura.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having ordinary radioles, some Canalipalpata possess one or more highly modified radioles located on the dorsal part of the head. This specialized structure is called an <b>operculum.</b> The <b>operculum</b> is a cone-shaped cartilaginous structure located at the distal {{end of a long}} cartilaginous stalk. When threatened or disturbed, the animal withdraws rapidly into its protective calcareous tube and employs the <b>operculum</b> as a plug to occlude the entrance to the tube. The <b>operculum,</b> which is usually similar in color to the other radioles, secretes a mucus which seems to possess antibiotic properties. It is not unusual for the animal to have two crowns, and hence two opercula.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{specimens}} in {{the genus}} Limacina have usually lost the <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The frontal <b>operculum</b> is speculated to be {{the memory}} and {{association}} hub for taste.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing an {{opposing}} tooth which bites into the affected <b>operculum</b> can eliminate this source of trauma.|$|E
25|$|Blanfordia is a genus of {{terrestrial}} gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Pomatiopsidae. They are land snails which have an <b>operculum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nares of some {{birds are}} covered by an <b>operculum</b> (plural opercula), a membraneous, horny or {{cartilaginous}} flap. In diving birds, the <b>operculum</b> keeps {{water out of the}} nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the <b>operculum.</b> Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of Attagis seedsnipe help to keep dust out. The nares of nestling tawny frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselvesâ€”both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. These opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach adulthood. In pigeons, the <b>operculum</b> has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits {{at the base of the}} bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the cere, this is a different structure. Tapaculos are the only birds able to move their opercula.|$|E
25|$|Pericoronitis {{is caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of bacteria and debris beneath the <b>operculum,</b> or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the <b>operculum</b> with the opposing tooth). Pericoronitis {{is often associated with}} partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth), often occurring at the age of wisdom tooth eruption (15-24). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain, pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay), and acute myofascial pain in temporomandibular joint disorder.|$|E
25|$|Harvey had {{reported}} that Einstein had no parietal <b>operculum</b> in either hemisphere, but this finding has been disputed. Photographs {{of the brain}} show an enlarged Sylvian fissure.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal <b>operculum</b> (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.|$|E
25|$|Elimia virginica, {{common names}} the Piedmont elimia or Virginia river snail, is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} snail with an <b>operculum,</b> an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Pleuroceridae.|$|E
25|$|Viviparus georgianus, {{common name}} the banded mystery snail, is {{a species of}} large {{freshwater}} snail with gills and an <b>operculum,</b> an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Viviparidae, the river snails.|$|E
25|$|This {{can result}} in abscess formation. Left untreated, the abscess can spontaneously drain into the mouth from beneath the <b>operculum.</b> In chronic pericoronitis, {{drainage}} may happen through an approximal sinus tract.|$|E
25|$|Inadequate {{cleaning}} of the <b>operculum</b> space allows stagnation of bacteria and any accumulated debris. This {{can be a}} result of poor access due to limited room {{in the case of the}} 3rd molars.|$|E
