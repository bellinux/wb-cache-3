5|$|Overall, {{damage was}} minimal {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>Katrina.</b> Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was {{estimated}} that between 10 and 15inches (250 to 375mm) of rain fell across parts of {{the region as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>Katrina,</b> with one report of 3.58inches (91mm) in six hours from the island of San Andrés east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Aguán.|$|E
5|$|There {{were reports}} of snipers taking potshots at rescue helicopters; these were false. Reports of gangs roving the city {{shooting}} {{police officers and}} survivors were also false, as only one policeman {{was shot in the}} aftermath <b>of</b> <b>Katrina</b> and no indictments were brought forward against the supposed gang members.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>Katrina,</b> 150,000people and 120,000head {{of cattle}} in central Cuba were evacuated, {{according to a}} broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to, and did not, {{pose a threat to}} the United States.|$|E
50|$|Built on the city's {{old high}} ground, the {{neighborhood}} escaped the catastrophic flooding {{of most of}} the city in the aftermath <b>of</b> Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> in 2005 (see: Effect <b>of</b> Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> on New Orleans).|$|R

2500|$|Mississippi, and [...] east <b>of</b> <b>Katrina's</b> landfall, {{was flooded}} from surge. Other Jackson County {{communities}} such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Shores were destroyed, and St. Martin was hard hit; Ocean Springs, Moss Point, Gautier, and Escatawpa also suffered major surge damage.|$|R
5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands. The event spanned August26–31, 2005, with 57tornadoes touching down across 8states. One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage {{for the month}} of August. Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi, multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus {{the full extent of the}} hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle <b>of</b> <b>Katrina.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, the United Nations {{deployed}} {{field assessment}} teams {{to survey the}} damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims <b>of</b> <b>Katrina</b> and Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>Katrina</b> 50 {{families}} that {{were members of}} Beth Israel left New Orleans, and gave up membership in the congregation. These included Rabbi Schiff and his family. After the flood Beth Israel's board of directors informed Schiff, who had joined they synagogue in April 2002, {{that it would not}} be able to meet its contractual obligations and pay him past December. Schiff and his family had also lost their home and much of their possessions, and had been living in Memphis. Schiff resigned effective November 1, 2005, citing this loss, and the lack of a functioning Jewish Day School in the area for his children.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of October29, a {{tropical}} wave, tracking towards the west, began {{to interact with the}} depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems. An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed {{to the north of the}} system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity. By 0000UTC on October30, the center <b>of</b> <b>Katrina</b> made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was {{initially}} scheduled to release on 27 May, but was postponed to 24 June and further to 15 July 2011. It released in 1800 screens worldwide. A special {{screening of the}} film was shown at the residence of Shahrukh Khan on 16 July, the birthday <b>of</b> <b>Katrina</b> Kaif. The event was attended by several celebrities besides the film's cast and crew themselves. However, the Shiv Sena criticised the event as it was held {{three days after the}} 2011 Mumbai bombings. The producers of the film donated a cheque containing the collections of the film from around 10 theatres in Mumbai to the Maharashtra government as a mark of charity to the victims of the blasts. On 24 March 2012, ZNMD was screened exclusively at the Bucks New University in High Wycombe, UK.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the three}} have {{overlooked}} one big detail—that {{as long as}} Katrina is alive, she'll never allow the three to be together. Katrina is all out to destroy them because of three reasons. First, Marie is the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Katrina's</b> former lover. Second, Rina knows too much of Rodriguez' family secrets. And lastly, Ella is the sole heir of the 800-million Rodriguez' wealth, <b>of</b> which <b>Katrina</b> is after for. Since all evil have their nemesis, Katrina has Tiya Corazon to stop her. Tiya Corazon is Katrina's long-lost aunt who knows Katrina's dark secrets.|$|R
