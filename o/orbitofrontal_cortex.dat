5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, <b>orbitofrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the <b>orbitofrontal</b> <b>cortex)</b> could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

Additionally, di¡erences between old and new items mainly a¡ected bilateral orbitofrontal regions when processing positive words.

40|$|The {{ability to}} make {{judgments}} about mental states is critical to social interactions. Simulation theory suggests that the observer covertly mimics {{the activity of the}} observed person, leading to shared states of mind between the observer and the person observed. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the neural networks activated while subjects watched videos of themselves and of others lifting a box, and judged the beliefs of the actors about the weight of the box. A parietal premotor circuit was recruited during action perception, and the activity started earlier when making judgments about one's own actions as opposed to those of others. This earlier activity in action-related structures can be explained by simulation theory on the basis that when one observes one's own actions, there is a closer match between the simulated and perceived action than there is when one observes the actions of others. When the observers judged the actions to reflect a false belief, there was activation in the superior temporal sulcus, <b>orbitofrontal,</b> paracingulate <b>cortex</b> and cerebellum. We suggest that this reflects a mismatch between the perceived action and the predicted action's outcomes derived from simulation...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is a heritable neuropsychiatric disorder {{associated with}} abnormal reward processing. Limited and inconsistent data exist about the neural mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Furthermore, {{it is not}} known whether reward processing is abnormal in unaffected siblings of participants with ADHD. Method: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain responses during reward anticipation and receipt with an adapted monetary incentive delay task in a large sample of adolescents and young adults with ADHD (n = 150), their unaffected siblings (n = 92), and control participants (n = 108), all of the same age. Results: Participants with ADHD showed, relative to control participants, increased responses in the anterior cingulate, anterior frontal cortex, and cerebellum during reward anticipation, and in the <b>orbitofrontal,</b> occipital <b>cortex</b> and ventral striatum. Responses of unaffected siblings were increased in these regions as well, except for the cerebellum during anticipation and ventral striatum during receipt. Conclusion: ADHD in adolescents and young adults is associated with enhanced neural responses in frontostriatal circuitry to anticipation and receipt of reward. The findings support models emphasizing aberrant reward processing in ADHD, and suggest that processing of reward is subject to familial influences. Future studies using standard monetary incentive delay task parameters are needed to replicate our findings...|$|R

In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of an observation paradigm. Our results indicate that being imitated compared to not being imitated activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion and reward processing, namely medial <b>orbitofrontal</b> cortex/ventromedial prefrontal <b>cortex</b> (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast).

40|$|Regret-related brain {{activity}} {{is dependent on}} free choice, but {{it is unclear whether}} this activity is a function of more subtle differences in the degree of responsibility a decision-maker exerts over a regrettable outcome. In this experiment, we show that trial-by-trial subjective ratings of regret depend on a higher subjective sense of responsibility, as well as being dependent on objective responsibility. Using fMRI we show an enhanced amygdala response to regret-related outcomes when these outcomes are associated with high, as compared to low, responsibility. This enhanced response was maximal in participants who showed a greater level of enhancement in their subjective ratings of regret engendered by an objective increase in responsibility. <b>Orbitofrontal</b> and cingulate <b>cortex</b> showed opposite effects, with an enhanced response for regret-related outcomes when participants were not objectively responsible. The findings indicate that the way the brain processes regret-related outcomes depends on both objective and subjective aspects of responsibility, highlighting the critical importance of the amygdala...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLearned cues for {{pleasant}} reward often elicit desire, which, in addicts, {{may become}} compulsive. According {{to the dominant}} view in addiction neuroscience and reinforcement modeling, such desires are the simple products of learning, coming from a past association with reward outcome. ResultsWe demonstrate that cravings are more than merely the products of accumulated pleasure memories—even a repulsive learned cue for unpleasantness can become suddenly desired via the activation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry. Rats learned repulsion toward a Pavlovian cue (a briefly-inserted metal lever) that always predicted an unpleasant Dead Sea saltiness sensation. Yet, upon first reencounter in a novel sodium-depletion state to promote mesocorticolimbic reactivity (reflected by elevated Fos activation in ventral tegmentum, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and the <b>orbitofrontal</b> prefrontal <b>cortex),</b> the learned cue was instantly transformed into an attractive and powerful motivational magnet. Rats jumped and gnawed on the suddenly attractive Pavlovian lever cue, despite never having tasted intense saltiness {{as anything other than}} disgusting. ConclusionsInstant desire transformation of a learned cue contradicts views that Pavlovian desires are essentially based on previously learned values (e. g., prediction error or temporal difference models). Instead desire is recomputed at reencounter by integrating Pavlovian information with the current brain/physiological state. This powerful brain transformation reverses strong learned revulsion into avid attraction. When applied to addiction, related mesocorticolimbic transformations (e. g., drugs or neural sensitization) of cues for already-pleasant drug experiences could create even more intense cravings. This cue/state transformation helps define what it means to say that addiction hijacks brain limbic circuits of natural reward...|$|R

40|$|Aims: In {{progressive}} supranuclear palsy (PSP) {{tissue damage}} occurs in specific cortical and subcortical regions. Voxel based analysis using T 1 -weighted images depict quantitative gray matter (GM) atrophy changes. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging depicts qualitative {{changes in the}} brain parenchyma. The purpose of our {{study was to investigate}} whether MT imaging could indicate abnormalities in PSP. Settings and Design: A total of 10 patients with PSP (9 men and 1 woman) and 8 controls (5 men and 3 women) were studied with T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3 DMT imaging. Voxel based analysis of T 1 -weighted MRI was performed to investigate brain atrophy while MT was used to study qualitative abnormalities in the brain tissue. We used SPM 8 to investigate group differences (with two sample t-test) using the GM and white matter (WM) segmented data. Results: T 1 -weighted imaging and MT are equally sensitive to detect changes in GM and WM in PSP. Magnetization transfer ratio images and magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo revealed extensive bilateral volume and qualitative changes in the <b>orbitofrontal,</b> prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and limbic lobe and sub cortical GM. The prefrontal structures involved were the rectal gyrus, medial, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The anterior cingulate, cingulate gyrus and lingual gyrus of limbic lobe and subcortical structures such as caudate, thalamus, insula and claustrum were also involved. Cerebellar involvement mainly of anterior lobe was also noted.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a model of cerebral atrophic changes associated with the progression of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Linear registration, region-of-interest analysis, and voxel-based morphometry methods have all been employed to elucidate the changes observed at discrete intervals during a disease process. In addition to describing the nature of the changes, modeling disease-related changes via deformations can also provide information on temporal characteristics. In order to continuously model changes associated with AD, deformation maps from 21 patients were averaged across a novel z-score disease progression dimension based on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. The resulting deformation maps are presented via three metrics: local volume loss (atrophy), volume (CSF) increase, and translation (interpreted as representing collapse of cortical structures). Inspection of the maps revealed significant perturbations in the deformation fields corresponding to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, <b>orbitofrontal</b> and parietal <b>cortex,</b> and regions surrounding the sulci and ventricular spaces, with earlier changes predominantly lateralized to the left hemisphere. These changes are consistent with results from post-mortem studies of AD. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies suggest}} that piriform cortex is {{activated}} {{at least in part}} by sniffing. We used H 2 15 O positron emission tomography (PET) to study 15 healthy volunteers while they participated in four conditions, two of which were sniffing odorants and odorless air. The remaining two conditions involved a constant, very low flow of either odorized or odorless air during velopharyngeal closure (VPC), a technique that prevents subject-induced airflow through the nasal passages. Contrary to expectation, sniffing under odorless conditions did not induce significant piriform and surrounding cortical (PC+) activity when compared to odorless VPC, even at a liberal statistical threshold. However, a small correlation emerged in PC+ between the difference signal of [odorless sniffing odorless VPC] and peak rate of nasal pressure change. PC+ activity was, however, strongly evoked by odorant exposure during sniffing and VPC, with neither technique showing greater activation. Activity in <b>orbitofrontal</b> (olfactory association) <b>cortex</b> was absent during odorant stimulation (OS) with VPC, but present during odorant sniffing. Sniffing may therefore {{play an important role in}} facilitating the higher-order analysis of odors. A right orbitofrontal region was also activated with odorless sniffing, which suggests a possible orbitofrontal role in guided olfactory exploration...|$|R

40|$|Functional imaging {{studies of}} healthy {{participants}} and previous lesion studies have provided evidence that empathy involves dissociable cognitive functions {{that rely on}} at least partially distinct neural networks that can be individually impaired by brain damage. These studies converge {{in support of the}} proposal that affective empathy—making inferences about how another person feels—engages at least the following areas: prefrontal <b>cortex,</b> <b>orbitofrontal</b> gyrus, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole, amygdala and temporoparietal junction. We hypothesized that right-sided lesions to any one of these structures, except temporoparietal junction, would cause impaired affective empathy (whereas bilateral damage to temporopar-ietal junction would be required to disrupt empathy). We studied 27 patients with acute right hemisphere ischaemic stroke and 24 neurologically intact inpatients on a test of affective empathy. Acute impairment of affective empathy was associated with infarcts in the hypothesized network, particularly temporal pole and anterior insula. All patients with impaired affective empathy were also impaired in comprehension of affective prosody, but many patients with impairments in prosodic comprehension had spared affective empathy. Patients with impaired affective empathy were older, but showed no difference in performance o...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetoencephalography}} (MEG) {{signal was}} recorded while subjects watched a video containing separate blocks of effective and cognitive advertisements and recalled slides {{extracted from the}} video a day later. An earlier behavioural study using the same video material showed that the affective advertisements were better recalled and that administration of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) abolished this effect. Magnetic field tomography (MFT) was used to extract tomographic estimates of activity millisecond by millisecond from the continuous MEG signal. Statistically significant differences between affective and cognitive blocks were identified in posterior and prefrontal areas. Cognitive blocks produced stronger activity in posterior parietal areas and superior prefrontal cortex in all three subjects. Affective blocks modulated activity in <b>orbitofrontal</b> and retrosplenial <b>cortex,</b> amygdala and brainstem. Individual contributions to the statistical maps were traced in real time from milliseconds to many seconds. Time-locked responses from the recall session were used to compare average and single trial MFT solutions and to combine activations from all subjects into a common anatomical space.

40|$|Negative {{life events}} (NLE) {{contribute}} to {{anxiety and depression}} disorders, but their relationship with brain functioning in adolescence has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that neural response to social threat would relate to NLE in the frontal–limbic emotional regions. Participants (N = 685) were drawn from the Imagen database of 14 -year-old community adolescents recruited in schools. They underwent functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the ‘distress’, ‘family’ and ‘accident’ subscales from a life event dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with anxiety or depression outcomes {{at the age of}} 16 years were also investigated. Lifetime ‘distress’ positively correlated with ventral-lateral <b>orbitofrontal</b> and temporal <b>cortex</b> activations during angry face processing. ‘Distress’ scores correlated with the probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime ‘family’ and ‘accident’ scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs differentially predicted neural responses to threat during adolescence, and differentially predicted a de novo internalizing condition 2 years later. The deleterious effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested...|$|R
25|$|The <b>orbitofrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (OFC) {{represents}} the main neocortical target of primary olfactory cortex. In non-human primates, the olfactory neocortex is situated along the basal {{surface of the}} caudal frontal lobes, encompassing agranular and dysgranular OFC medially and agranular insula laterally, where this latter structure wraps onto the posterior orbital surface.

25|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) to image the human OFC is a challenge, because this brain region is in proximity to the air-filled sinuses.

40|$|Faces {{are highly}} emotive stimuli {{and we find}} smiling or {{familiar}} faces both attractive and comforting, even as young babies. Do other species with sophisticated face recognition skills, such as sheep, also respond to the emotional significance of familiar faces? We report that when sheep experience social isolation, the sight of familiar sheep face pictures {{compared with those of}} goats or inverted triangles significantly reduces behavioural (activity and protest vocalizations), autonomic (heart rate) and endocrine (cortisol and adrenaline) indices of stress. They also increase mRNA expression of activity-dependent genes (c-fos and zif/ 268) in brain regions specialized for processing faces (temporal and medial frontal cortices and basolateral amygdala) and for emotional control (<b>orbitofrontal</b> and cingulate <b>cortex),</b> and reduce their expression in regions associated with stress responses (hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus) and fear (central and lateral amygdala). Effects on face recognition, emotional control and fear centres are restricted to the right brain hemisphere. Results provide evidence that face pictures may be useful for relieving stress caused by unavoidable social isolation in sheep, and possibly other animal species, including humans. The finding that sheep, like humans, appear to have a right brain hemisphere involvement in the control of negative emotional experiences also suggests that functional lateralization of brain emotion systems may be a general feature in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} {{refers to}} an individual’s ability to process and respond to emotions, including recognizing the expression of emotions in others, using emotions to enhance thought and decision making, and regulating emotions to drive effective behaviors. Despite their importance for goal-directed social behavior, {{little is known about}} the neural mechanisms underlying specific facets of emotional intelligence. Here, we report findings from a study investigating the neural bases of these specific components for emotional intelligence in a sample of 130 combat veterans with penetrating traumatic brain injury. We examined the neural mechanisms underlying experiential (perceiving and using emotional information) and strategic (understanding and managing emotions) facets of emotional intelligence. Factor scores were submitted to voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. The results indicate that two facets of emotional intelligence (perceiving and managing emotions) engage common and distinctive neural systems, with shared dependence on the social knowledge network, and selective engagement of the <b>orbitofrontal</b> and parietal <b>cortex</b> for strategic aspects of emotional information processing. The observed pattern of findings suggests that sub-facets of experiential and strategic emotional intelligence can be characterized as separable but related processes that depend upon a core network of brain structures within frontal, temporal and parietal cortex...|$|R

AND is detected primarily in male sweat, whereas EST {{has been found}} in female urine. In a previous positron emission tomography study, we found that smelling AND and EST activated regions covering sexually dimorphic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus, and that this activation was differentiated with respect to sex and compound.

In contrast to heterosexual men, and in congruence with heterosexual women, homosexual men displayed hypothalamic activation in response to AND. Maximal activation was observed in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus, which, according to animal studies, is highly involved in sexual behavior. As opposed to putative pheromones, common odors were processed similarly in all three groups of subjects and engaged only the olfactory brain (amygdala, piriform, <b>orbitofrontal,</b> and insular <b>cortex).</b> These findings show that our brain reacts differently to the two putative pheromones compared with common odors, and suggest a link between sexual orientation and hypothalamic neuronal processes...|$|R
