5|$|The total {{complement}} <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation of a large number <b>of</b> <b>proteins,</b> mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability <b>of</b> <b>proteins.</b> Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania.

5|$|Crystal {{structures}} <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> (which are irregular {{and hundreds}} of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal structures <b>of</b> <b>proteins,</b> nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E
