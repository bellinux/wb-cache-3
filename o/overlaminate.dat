40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the damage tolerance assessment of laminated composite structures used in ship structures. An intensive review has been carried out with regard to current experimental, analytical and numerical work on both laminates and structural elements. Particular attention has been focused on the problem of damage due to delamination and its structural consequences. Strength assessments of top hat stiffeners and tee joints has been carried out with a view to identifying regions most susceptible to delaminations. It has been shown that such regions are contained within the curved region of the <b>overlaminate</b> in both types of structural elements. Strain energy release rates and J-integral values have been calculated for specific cracks to determine their likelihood of propagation under a variety of loading conditions. Overall, a number of conclusions have been drawn with regard to single-skin marine FRP structures. For example, both the strength - and the energy - based approaches have predicted that a tee joint subjected to a 45 degree pull-off load, delaminations which are deep within the <b>overlaminate</b> are more likely to propagate than those close to the surface...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a series of tensile pull off tests on Composite T-joints as part of a {{comprehensive}} test programme undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} EUCLID RTP 3. 21 project on “Survivability, Durability and Performance of Naval Composite Structures”. The tests have been developed to evaluate joints suitable for use with large composite superstructures i. e. a hangar on a frigate type warship. To assess the performance of these joints under quasi-static and dynamic loading, test procedures have been developed using both shock table facilities and conventional servo-hydraulic test machines. The test procedures are fully complementary to ensure that test results can be directly compared. Test results established that the joint failed within the interface between the base sandwich laminate and the joint <b>overlaminate.</b> As joint assembly is a secondary process this is to be anticipated. Both the dynamic and quasi-static test results showed similar tensile loading performances; for quasi-static testing core shear failure immediately preceded joint failure, whereas no core failure was noted for the dynamic tests. These results suggest that the joint and base sandwich laminate chosen for the EUCLID RTP 3. 21 project are well matche...|$|E
40|$|The extreme loading {{conditions}} produced from the detonation of an explosive are severely detrimental to structures and structural components. These effects are amplified when a blast occurs in an enclosed or confined geometry, where reduced ventilation and oblique angles result in extended pulse durations and added reflections of generated pressures. The {{objective of this}} dissertation is to develop experimental methodologies and numerical assessment tools to document and simulate failure sequences in composite sandwich connections under simulated internal blast loads. The experimental research was conducted using the UCSD Blast Simulator, a one-of-a- kind system able to simulate explosive events {{without the use of}} explosive materials and therefore without the associated fireballs. This is accomplished with an array of high velocity hydraulic actuators driven by a combined high pressure nitrogen/hydraulic energy source. In explosive field testing, video and data from instrumentation is often lost to the destructive nature of the blast environment. The simulator allows for the generation of high fidelity data that documents the response and failure progression in structural members, which in turn lends researchers the ability to develop and test damage mitigation strategies as well as design guidelines for critical infrastructure subject to impulsive loads. First, the development of loading protocols were presented, in which pressures of prolonged durations distributed in multiple directions were achieved through the impact of high strength water filled bladders. These methods were then implemented in the testing of 90 degree composite sandwich joint specimens, which were reacted via adjustable steel gripping fixtures mounted in configurations suitable for impact with the high powered Blast Generators. In an effort to create a numerical model capable of simulating the failure modes observed in the Blast Simulator experiments, a series of individual component tests were conducted to assist in the calibration of finite element material models. The characterization of the CFRP facesheet/balsa wood core sandwich material's failure properties in bending, shear and delamination were documented experimentally and validated numerically using LS-DYNA under both quasi- static and dynamic load rates. Finally, the updated material models were implemented into the simulation of the Composite Joint Tests, which highlight the key mechanisms involved in connection failure and ultimately joint breach. The studies found that failure of the connection structure were functions of the bond strength between the panel facesheets and <b>overlaminate</b> used to adhere the sandwich panels together, strongly coupled with the shear capacity of the individual panel cores. Recommendations for improved joint design were made and suggestions for extrapolation of the developed technologies to larger scale testing were offere...|$|E

Adhesive bonding resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} assembly time for bulkhead connections compared with overlamination. Drop tests and sea trials were performed using specially adapted strain gauge instrumentation. These indicated low adhesive joint strain levels, even for severe test conditions. No damage was observed. The data obtained will be used to improve laboratory test procedures to simulate service loading of boat structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{expanding}} {{application of}} polymeric composite {{materials in the}} Aerospace industry {{has led to the}} extension of its application to other industries such as the marine industry. A typical joint between the hull and bulkhead used in a monocoque structure is known as a T-joint. It consists of composite <b>overlaminates</b> over a shaped fillet to allow the transmission of direct and membrane shear stresses. The CTE (crack tip element) method offers the capability to provide accurate results with minimum computational resources. It is also an excellent damage prediction tool for composite laminates where oscillatory singularity exists at the crack tip. This paper describes the application of the CTE method for damage prediction of the T-joint. Issues involved in the current modeling approach and recommended solutions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For a {{monocoque}} hull structure, {{the bulkhead}} {{is used to}} separate the hull into many compartments. A typical joint between the hull and bulkhead used in such structure {{is known as a}} T-joint. It consists of composite <b>overlaminates</b> over a shaped fillet to allow the transmission of direct and membrane shear stresses. This paper describes the numerical solutions of the analytical approach in studying of the effect of disbond for a composite ship T-Joint using two methods, the VCCT (Virtual Crack Closure Technique) and CTE (Crack Tip Element) method. The analysis was conducted for T-Joints with various disbond sizes. It was subjected to a straight pull-off load to simulate normal operational conditions. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate the FE (Finite Element) models. The results of the numerical and experimental studies are discussed to corroborate the effectiveness of using fracture mechanics for this analysing this structure. A modified CTE model for the T-joint is proposed to enable a like-for-like comparison to that evaluated by the VCCT method...|$|R
