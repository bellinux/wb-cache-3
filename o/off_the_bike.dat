25|$|To {{make things}} a little more interesting, each team, no matter what type of {{exchange}} they are doing, has to perform their exchange in the distance of two pits. The action of slowing {{is not part of}} the exchange, but the first rider is not allowed to begin getting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> until one pit ahead of their team's and the second rider must have complete control of the bike by the end of the team's pit. For bike-to-bike exchanges, the second person CANNOT move until tagged by the first person and the first person MUST stop before end of her team's pit. Failure to do either of these things will result in a penalty for the team.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of using}} stunt doubles, De Bont persuaded Bullock, Patric, and Dafoe {{to perform their}} own stunts, so the scenes would appear more realistic; the lead actors were {{required}} to engage in physical exercise sessions before and during filming. [...] Stunt coordinator Dick Ziker was very impressed with Patric's stuntwork, {{and said that he}} [...] "is so physical he probably {{could be one of the}} top stunt men in the world". His stunts included being dragged by a seaplane through the water, jumping onto collapsing buildings, and scuba diving while pulled by a moving ship. He was also required to tread water for multiple hours at a time. [...] During a motorcycle stunt on a Ducati916 on the second day of filming, Patric flew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> [...] into the air and landed on a small bush; Bullock said the incident was so serious that Patric [...] "should be dead". [...] After surviving a traumatic surfing incident as a teenager, Bullock had to overcome her fear of water to perform necessary stuntwork in the film. During production at sea, Bullock was smacked into the ship on multiple occasions, and was saved by Patric from decapitation by the ship's rudder in one scene. Bullock and Patric also had a scene filmed in an underwater tank where they had to kiss underwater with Bullock's hands tied together. Navy SEALs with scuba gear were present inside the tank during shooting, as the actors had to hold their breath during the scene. According to Bullock, she performed all of her own stuntwork [...] "except for a quarter of one stunt"; her stunt double worked for only three days during production. Of all the stunt-related incidents during production, De Bont said the most frightening was when a stunt woman was hit in the face by a boat cable and required reconstructive surgery. Following the production at sea, De Bont said that filming on water [...] "was 100 percent more difficult than [...] imagined".|$|E
2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the back wheel, then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider gets <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> keeps going as if someone were really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the back wheel of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this type of accident. Another risk is that the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E
5000|$|Bike sheds (also called bicycle sheds) usually {{contain a}} {{framework}} on which bikes can be supported and locked and a roof to keep rain and/or snow <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes.</b> Bike sheds range from {{little more than}} a supported roof to more-complex structures with walls and locking doors or gates. The color of a bikeshed is the topic of a well-known adage about the challenges of group work in organizational psychology.|$|R

The Suzuki GZ250 is a more cruiser oriented version of GN250 in terms of dimensions with same drivetrain. Suzuki TU250 is a modern evolution of this bike with EFI and different styling.|$|R
2500|$|Larry had {{expressed}} apprehension that day about performing the stunt. [...] Larry shared with Mondo {{that he did}} not have a good feeling about doing it, but he felt pressure to do it. [...] Bambi said that normally Larry did this stunt after the bigger stunts as [...] "his way of blowing off steam...winding down." [...] As Larry was performing the maneuver, something went wrong and the front end of his bike started to wobble. Rather than being able to jump down in the seat and regain control, Larry fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> hitting his head. [...] Larry sustained serious head injuries and he was airlifted to the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. [...] Indian Larry died from his injuries on Monday, August 30, 2004 at 3:30am. [...] He was 55 years old. [...] The last words that Larry uttered were to his wife Bambi (who was at the event) saying, [...] "Sweetie, sweetie." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{perform the}} [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, the first rider must exit {{the pack and}} coast for about 15 meters in order to slow down. Then the rider on the bike will soft pedal until the right foot is back and level with the left foot in the front. Once the feet are set, the rider will then forcefully pedal backwards. Because the Little 500 Bikes are coaster brakes, this action causes the bike's wheels to stop dead and forces the bike to skid along the cinder track. During this skid, the rider on the bike will take her left foot off the pedal and swing {{it over to the}} right side. Then the left foot will come behind the right and hit the ground, soon {{followed}} by the right foot. This rider will still be running once <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and hand it off to the next rider. This is where many riders differ. Some mount the bike by crossing their left foot over and stepping on the left petal and then swinging their right foot over the bike. But more commonly, riders will run and then literally jump onto the bike seat. Both types have their advantages. The step on style can be very slow (if performed incorrectly) and impossible to perform if the pedals are not set properly by the first rider. But it is far less painful for the rider and much more reliable. On the other hand, jumping on the bike guarantees that the rider will get on the bike, and, when performed correctly, is faster than stepping on, but it can be very painful for most riders and often the initial shock of landing causes a momentary delay before the rider starts to get up to speed. This delay can cost crucial seconds when it comes to catching the pack. Also, for men there is the possibility of permanent damage to their reproductive organs. And many women suffer from vaginal bruising. Jumping on is also more dangerous because if performed improperly, riders are likely to take very hard falls.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{anti-pollution}} organizations and activists have encouraged society to use eco-friendly transportation like ride-sharing and <b>biking.</b> According to <b>the</b> San Luis Obispo Police Department, however, bike owners report approximately 269 bike thefts per year. This statistic illustrates {{the need for a}} more effective way to protect bicycle property. The development of an alarm system for <b>the</b> U-Lock <b>bike</b> lock encourages bike owners to ride their bicycles by providing them with additional measures to protect their bicycle property. This U-Lock accessory, when cut, sounds an alarm to alert nearby persons of the theft-in-progress. In order to turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> alarm, <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> owner must disconnect <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> lock and disable the alarm.

50|$|This 3.30 mi, packed-gravel {{trail was}} {{developed}} in 1986 as a N.Y.S. Environmental Quality Bond Act Project. It runs parallel to (NE of) Coddington Road in the Town of Ithaca, mostly following the abandoned rail bed of the Cayuga and Susquehanna Railroad, which was built in 1849 to ship coal from Pennsylvania mines to Ithaca for water shipment over the Erie Canal. Eventually it merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and was abandoned in 1956. The descent into Ithaca from South Hill was via two switchbacks. The trail skips the middle switchback. Instead it follows a short steep asphalt-paved connector (not part of the railroad) from the upper to lower grades. The tail tracks of the switchbacks {{are not included in}} the trail; these were located NW of Coddington Road {{at the end of the}} upper trail, and SE of the bottom of the connector, respectively. Except for the connector, the trail is a gradual downhill from Burns Road to Ithaca. Hiking paths lead <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>biking</b> trail into <b>the</b> Six Mile Creek gorge. The trail is a popular spot for cross-country skiing in the winter, and in the summer, connects Ithaca College students to sunning and (illegal) swimming in Six Mile Creek and the City Reservoir.|$|R
