In this paper, we propose the middleware framework with an algorithm to manage multi-readers based on this middleware to identify tags efficiently. The proposed middleware assigns the role of readers based on three parameters, i. e., application requirements, the feedback information of readers, and the information of connected readers. To determine the role of readers, the proposed middleware uses the PEG (Pre-Estimation of Group) algorithm. We examine the performance of proposed middleware framework and PEG algorithm by using Gen 2 simulator. As a result, when worst case is occurred in a particular group, the performance of tag identification per reader improves about 170 %...|$|E

This paper proposes a new spatial-temporal approach to identify programs in TV streams in two main steps: First, a reference catalogue for video grammars of visual jingles is constructed. We exploit visual grammars characterizing instances of the same program type {{in order to identify}} the various program types in the TV stream. The role of video grammar is to represent the visual invariants for each visual jingle using a set of descriptors appropriate for each TV program. Secondly, programs in TV streams are identified by examining the similarity of the video signal to the visual grammars in the catalogue. The main idea <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>process</b> consists in comparing the visual similarity of the video signal signature in TV stream to the catalogue elements.

40|$|In this paper, we {{approach}} the problem of identifying a set of objects in an RFID network. We propose {{a modified version of}} Slotted Aloha protocol {{to reduce the number of}} transmission collisions. All tags select a slot to transmit their ID by generating a random number. If there is a collision in a slot, the reader broadcasts the next identification request only to tags which collided in that slot. Besides, we present an extensive comparative evaluation of collision resolution protocols for tag identification problem in RFID networks. After a quick survey of the best performing RFID tag identification protocols, both deterministic and probabilistic, we present the outcome of intensive simulation experiments set up to evaluate several metrics, such as the total delay <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>process</b> and the bit complexity of reader and tags. The last metric is strictly related to energy constraints required by an RFID system.

The model was built without the knowledge of the mechanisms that occur in the process, only based on the relationship between the collected data. As an input parameter the defined type of motion was used, next converted to digital form by the real-time computer and sent to the axes control card. While the output signal was registered as a change of encoders position. Sampling time 20 ms was adopted. For each axis separately recorded measurements (signals were with different amplitudes and frequencies of motion tape device) [1]. In the next step the estimation was performed for the selection suitable algorithm, and the determination the parameters of model selected in the previous step [2]. The last step was to verify, to check the results <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>process.</b> By comparing the signals obtained in response to a signal given the model of a registered object actual output signal, it is possible to visually estimate the accuracy of the identification and designation of the error.
