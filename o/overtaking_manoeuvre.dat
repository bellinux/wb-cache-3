5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly {{began to pull}} away from the other cars, at the rate of about half a second per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position continued {{in the early stages of}} the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and continued in the race.|$|E
5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner. Jarvis came across the two slower cars at Copse corner and narrowly held off an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> from Dumas. The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after closing up to him through Club corner. While lapping Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began to pull away from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov driving into Maggots corner for second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into his garage and became the race's first retirement with accident damage on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue which meant he was unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into his garage where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from his garage by his team but drove slowly around the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E

25|$|George Russell won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the qualification race by setting the fastest lap in the event's second qualifying session but lost the lead to Ilott heading into the first corner. The qualification event was neutralised following an accident involving Hongli Ye and Daiki Sasaki, and when the race restarted four laps later, Félix da Costa drafted Ilott and overtook him {{to take over the}} lead. Ilott remained close behind Félix da Costa for the remaining five laps but was unable to reduce the time deficit which would have allowed him to affect an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on the Portuguese driver who maintained his advantage to win the qualification race.|$|E
25|$|Yoong is {{currently}} a driver in the Audi R8 LMS Cup with Audi TEDA. In the inaugural race in Shanghai, Yoong started second on the grid. At the start, he overtook rival Marchy Lee at the first corner and won the race. In the second race, Yoong finished 2nd behind Adderly Fong. The third round in Zhuhai, saw Yoong qualified on pole and during the race, he lost the lead as Lee overtook the Malaysian and Yoong was third {{at the end of}} lap one and in front a four-car battle that took place behind him. He eventually finished on the final podium position in third. During the fourth round, he finished third after an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> with Lee resulted in Yoong taking damage to his car.|$|E
25|$|Alex Lynn {{started from}} the pole {{position}} for the first race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying, but lost the lead to Daniel Abt at the start. Abt elected to conserve electrical energy, meaning he could not establish a healthy advantage {{at the front of}} the field and later struggled with his brakes, leading to his team to request that he focus on restoring electrical energy. After twice not being able to pass him two laps previously, Bird overtook Abt for first place on lap 16. Bird maintained the lead after the mandatory switch into his second car, until a safety car was necessitated for the Heidfeld's stricken car. At the lap 41-restart, Bird kept the lead and fended off an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> by Vergne on the final lap to win the race. There were two lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the event.|$|E
25|$|A perfect {{pit stop}} strategy, great <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> {{and a vast}} {{experience}} enabled Bernd Schneider (AMG-Mercedes C-Klasse) take the DTM victory when the series visited in 2007.

25|$|Félix da Costa's {{qualification}} race victory {{ensured that}} he started from pole position in the main event but lost the lead to his fast-starting teammate Sette Cãmara and second place to Ilott. Félix da Costa was able to reclaim second from Ilott and was 0.7 seconds behind Sette Cãmara before a safety car period neutralised the race and retook first from Sette Cãmara at the lap-seven restart. He pulled away from his teammate until a three-lap safety car period caused his advantage to be reduced to nothing and fended off an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> from Sette Cãmara at the restart to keep the first position. Rosenqvist overtook Sette Cãmara for second {{and was unable to}} draw close enough to affect an pass on Félix da Costa who remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race to win his second Macau Grand Prix. There were two lead changes and two yellow flags during the course of the race.|$|E
25|$|López {{lost control}} of his car's {{rear-end}} on lap 24, and spun into the turn eight wall, necessitating the deployment of the safety car, eliminating the time gaps in the field. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of}} lap 29, and racing resumed with di Grassi using FanBoost to pull clear from Vergne who was being pressured by teammate Sarrazin. Prost moved aside to allow teammate Buemi through for fifth place. Abt aggressively overtook Prost shortly after to move into sixth place and continued his goal of drawing closer to Buemi. On the 31st lap, Rosenqvist, who was challenging for a podium place, impacted the wall exiting the chicane, damaging his left-rear suspension and causing the Mahindra's steering arm to become bent. This enabled Buemi to take over fourth place and Rosenqvist fell down the order. Vergne drew close to di Grassi and was close behind him in the closing two laps. He feigned an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on di Grassi but the latter defended the lead.|$|E
25|$|Vettel {{made a good}} start, {{moving up}} to fifth {{by the end of}} the first lap but his {{teammate}} Ricciardo was forced wide onto the chicane's run-off area, dropping four positions over the same distance. Massa attempted to take over second place from Magnussen by braking later than he did at the start of lap two while Rosberg pulled away from the two drivers. Magnssen went wide at Curva Grande corner and fended off another <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> from Massa. DRS was enabled on the next lap and Hamilton used it to attack Massa, allowing Magnussen to pull away from the Williams car. After starting 21st, Kvyat passed both Marussia drivers and Kobayashi to run in 17th. Magnussen continued to defend but in doing so he ran deep entering the Rettifilo chicane, causing Massa to slipstream the McLaren driving towards the Variante della Roggia chicane and overtook him around the outside to claim second. Magnussen entered the turn off the racing line, spun his tyres leaving the corner, enabling Hamilton to gain the advantage by accelerating faster than Magnussen and passed him for third going into the first Lesmo corner. Massa and Hamilton pulled away from Magnussen who was being caught by a group of cars compromising of Vettel, Button, Alonso and Pérez.|$|E
40|$|In a `sustainably safe' {{traffic and}} {{transport}} system, regional roads are designed {{in such a}} way that vehicles travelling in opposite directions are separated from each other. On the Oostburg ring road, this design aspect was initially realised by building the road in the form of a 2 x 1 carriageway divided by two solid lines. Following reports that in practice, dangerous (<b>overtaking)</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> had been noted on the ring road, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research was commissioned to conduct an investigation into this matter. This preliminary study consisted of observations into the nature and scope of the <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> In addition, speed measurements were performed. The chosen solution for the Oostburg ring road did not offer a `sustainably safe' traffic situation since overtaking does occur, albeit by fewer than one percent of passing vehicles.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{utilisation}} of the Manchester Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Driving Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ) to examine the self-reported aberrant driving behaviours and safety attitudes of a sample of Australian fleet drivers (N = 443). Surveys were posted to drivers who {{agreed to participate in}} the study. Univariate analyses of the subscales revealed that participants were least concerned about speeding, followed by risky <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> while attitudes regarding the seriousness of close following and drink driving were significantly higher. In regards to behaviours, participants were most likely to report engaging in speeding and aggressive violations, and least likely to report making driving errors. Importantly, additional bi-variate analyses revealed that individuals who engaged in regular speeding behaviours and reported risky <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> were most likely to incur demerit point losses. The results indicate that fleet interventions designed to improve road safety may benefit from focusing on attempting to reduce speeding infringements and the possible "speeding culture" that may exist within the fleet industry. This paper will further outline the major findings of the study, highlight the limitations and provide direction for future fleet safety research...|$|R
25|$|Räikkönen passed Kobayashi at the Novelle chicane for 12th {{place on}} lap 33 but ran wide {{and handed the}} {{position}} back to Kobayashi. Vergne was handed a drive-through penalty for his unsafe pit stop release on the following lap and served it four laps later. After Räikkönen got past Kobayashi, Bianchi made contact with the Japanese driver three times en route to overtaking him around the outside at Rasacasse corner for 13th on lap 36. Upfront, Rosberg continued to lead Hamilton and the two drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Grosjean started to pressure Kobayashi for 14th but had difficulty passing the driver. He was able to get ahead of Kobayashi by braking late for the Novelle chicane on lap 40. Rosberg was instructed by his team over the radio that he should use longer gears at Sainte Dévote and Casino Square corners to save fuel. This meant Rosberg defended from Hamilton over the next few laps because of him having to lift and coast. Hamilton closed up to Rosberg but was unable to affect an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on his teammate who had faster acceleration entering the tunnel. Massa made his only pit stop of the race on lap 45 and emerged in 11th place behind Räikkönen but ahead of Bianchi.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton gained on Rosberg {{and was in}} {{the range}} to use DRS by lap 22 and on the {{following}} lap lined up an pass on his teammate on the back straight but was unable to get ahead. On lap 24, Rosberg selected a setting intended to provide him with additional power to defend against Hamilton of which he did not receive. Hamilton slipstreamed Rosberg on the backstraight, used DRS, and drove alongside his teammate going into turn 12. Rosberg attempted to defend his position but Hamilton steered to the inside of him and overtook him for the lead of the race. Hamilton forced Rosberg onto the turn's run-off area and both drivers narrowly avoided hitting each other and Hamilton began to pull away from his teammate. Alonso batted Button over the previous two laps and overtook him around the outside for seventh place on the same lap. Vergne attacked Grosjean on lap 25 after the latter could not overtake Vettel's slower car. Grosjean attempted a second <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> on Vettel on the following lap and passed him for ninth at the first turn. Alonso moved into sixth after overtaking Magnussen with a switchback manoeuvre at the first corner. Button lost eighth and ninth positions after Grosjean and Vergne passed him over the next two laps and Button made a pit stop for medium compound tyres on lap 29.|$|E

Yamashita and Ilott made {{contact with each other}} but the Japanese driver was able to move into fourth place after passing Ilott. Sette Cãmara slid sideways at Fisherman's Bend corner, allowing Rosenqvist to get into the slipstream of the Brazilian driver. Rosenqvist went to the outside line and passed Sette Cãmara driving into Lisboa corner to move into second place. Piquet collided with Ticktum, ending the Double R Racing driver's race while MacLeod went wide off the track in order to avoid a multi-car accident. Rosenqvist began catching Félix da Costa by setting the race's fastest lap on lap 14, completing a circuit of two minutes and 11.080 seconds, but was unable to get close to the Portuguese driver, though yellow flags were waved for Maini who drove straight at Lisboa corner. Félix da Costa controlled the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch the victory. It was the second Macau Grand Prix win of Félix da Costa's career. Rosenqvist finished in second place, 1.603 seconds behind, with Sette Cãmara in third, Yamashita fourth and Ilott fifth. Hughes, Russell, Juncadella, Piquet and Sims completed the top ten finishers. The race had two yellow flag periods and two lead changes among two different drivers. Félix da Costa led once for a total of nine laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} one of the partial studies within the {{framework}} of the long-term research programme `'Sustainably-safe road surroundings and traffic behaviour'. This study investigated whether, and in which way, an `extra sober' variant of carriageway separation affects driving behaviour. To do this, double broken axis lines and broken edge markings were introduced along a section of the provincial N 375 road between Pesse and Meppel in (the province of) Drenthe. For this study, data about a number of behaviour aspects of road users was gathered, before as well as after the changes. The control section was another section of the N 375. The lines along the experimental section before the changes, as well as those along the control section, consisted of a single broken axis line and continuous edge markings. Data was gathered to investigate whether the intended and/or unintended effects occurred, using video observations. The following behaviour was observed: the average speed, the speed distribution around this average, the number of exceeders of the 80 km/h speed limit on the N 375, their position on the road, the number of <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> and the average headway times.

25|$|Grosjean {{stopped on}} track near a fire marshal with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 65 {{and became the}} race's second (and final) retirement. Hülkenberg passed Magnussen for eighth on lap 68, while Räikkönen lost {{traction}} in his tyres {{at the bottom of}} the hill heading towards the Senna cichane, allowing teammate Alonso to pass him for sixth on the same lap. Hamilton pressured Rosberg and reduced the time deficit to his teammate to be 0.8 seconds behind at the start of the 71st (and final) lap, but Hamilton was unable to get close enough to affect an <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and Rosberg crossed the start/finish line first to win the race. Massa finished third, with Button in fourth and Vettel fifth. Alonso took sixth ahead of teammate Räikkönen, Hülkenberg was eighth, and Magnussen secured ninth. Bottas fended off an challenge from Kvyat in the final laps to secure the final points-scoring position of tenth. Maldonado, Vergne, Gutiérrez, Pérez and Sutil were the last of the classified finishers. It was Rosberg's fifth victory of the season, his first in Brazil, and the eighth of his career. Mercedes's one-two finish was their eleventh of the season, braking the previous record held by McLaren since 1988 with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. It was also the team's 15th victory of the year, equalling the record jointly held by McLaren and Ferrari. There were seven lead changes in the race: three drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg led four times for a total of 59 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E

40|$|Drivers' {{awareness}} of the rearward road scene is critical when contemplating or executing lane-change <b>manoeuvres,</b> such as <b>overtaking.</b> Preliminary investigations have speculated {{on the use of}} rear-facing cameras to relay images to displays mounted inside the car to create ‘digital mirrors'. These may overcome many of the limitations associated with traditional ‘wing’ and rear-view mirrors, yet will inevitably effect drivers' normal visual scanning behaviour, and may force them to consider the rearward road scene from an unfamiliar perspective that is incongruent with their mental model of the outside world. We describe a study conducted within a medium-fidelity simulator aiming to explore the visual behaviour, driving performance and opinions of drivers while using internally located digital mirrors during different <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> Using a generic UK motorway scenario, thirty-eight experienced drivers conducted <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> using each of five different layouts of digital mirrors with varying degrees of ‘real-world’ mapping. The results showed reductions in decision time for lane changes and eyes-off road time while using the digital mirrors, when compared with baseline traditional reflective mirrors, suggesting that digital displays may enable drivers to more rapidly pick up the salient information from the rearward road scene. Subjectively, drivers preferred configurations that most closely matched existing mirror locations, where aspects of real-world mapping were largely preserved. The research highlights important human factors issues that require further investigation prior to further development/implementation of digital mirrors within vehicles. Future work should also aim to validate findings within real-world on-road environments whilst considering the effects of digital mirrors on other important visual behaviour characteristics, such as depth perception...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{trajectory}} planning in an autonomous guidance application for one-way, two-lane roads. The problem is formulated in a receding horizon framework, as the minimization of the deviation from a desired velocity subject to a set of constraints introduced to avoid collision with surrounding vehicles, and to stay within the lane boundaries. As well known, this formulation can result in planning algorithms with prohibitive computational complexity, thus preventing real-time implementation. To avoid this limitation, the paper shows how the structured environment of one-way roads, can be exploited in order to formulate a low complexity receding horizon problem that can be efficiently solved in real-time.

Häkkinen stated that he was happy with his second-place result and praised his team's efforts. He also spoke of how he watched Michael Schumacher's racing lines and believed he would have passed him had he not retired with an engine failure. Barrichello revealed that he was ordered by Ferrari to reduce his pace in the race's closing stages as he held a large gap of 35 seconds to Villeneuve.|$|E

25|$|The 138 mile (222km) section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness, via Perth, was {{substantially}} rebuilt {{during the}} 1970s and 80s, but it follows {{essentially the same}} route except where it bypasses towns and villages instead of running through their centres. Between Perth and Inverness, the road has been dubbed Killer A9, because of accidents and fatalities where dual-carriageway sections merge into single-carriageway - the principal cause being motorists driving at excessive speeds to overtake lines of slower-moving vehicles before the dual carriageway ends. Dangerous <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> on the long single-carriageway stretches of the road are also common causes of accidents, as are the non-grade separated junctions along the northern sections, where drivers make a right turn across the opposing traffic flow.|$|R
40|$|At {{the start}} of the 21 st century {{overtaking}} on two-lane rural roads is a major traffic safety problem. However, this dissertation research demonstrates that most drivers are perfectly able to safely perform these manoeuvres. Their time spent in the left lane is about eight seconds. Preparing subtasks of the manoeuvre, such as checking surrounding vehicles' behaviours, changing gear and starting accelerations are started in the right lane. In this way, available overtaking gap in the oncoming traffic stream are optimally used. This anticipative behaviour is accounted for in the proposed overtaking assistant design, which informs the driver about overtaking gaps three seconds before they become available. This system is developed to assist less daring drivers with overtaking and to prevent risk-taking drivers to perform <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> in unsafe situations. A driving simulator experiment demonstrated that this assistant does not much affect overtaking efficiency, drivers' comfort or safety, as long as the threshold for a safe gap is chosen such that the safety margin with the first oncoming vehicle remains above three seconds. A microscopic traffic simulation study shows that when this threshold is eleven seconds, traffic system efficiency remains similar or increases slightly due to increased number of <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> Drivers' safety during overtaking increases, because the time-to-collision with oncoming vehicles will not become smaller than three seconds. And, drivers' comfort is improved in terms of higher overtaking frequencies and less time spent following. To introduce the proposed overtaking assistant to the market, vehicle-to-vehicle communication is necessary. This technology enables vehicles to localise all other surrounding vehicles. The automotive industry works hard on the development of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, however, it will take at least another ten years before the first overtaking assistant as proposed in this dissertation, will become available.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an observation study of interactions between bicyclists and buses on shared bus lanes. The aim of the paper is to analyse bicyclists' safety on bus lanes shared with bicyclists. Straight sections of two bus lanes shared with bicyclists in Belgium are observed. All interactions between bicyclists and buses over two full weeks are recorded and analysed. Additionally, the lateral position and riding speed of bicyclists that are in interaction with buses are compared with the behaviour of bicyclists that are not in interaction with buses. One of the observed bus lanes is in line with road design guidelines in a number of countries that state that a sufficiently narrow bus lane (< 3. 5. m) is hypothesised to be safer than a somewhat wider bus lane; the other observed bus lane is deemed too wide according to these guidelines and is hypothesised to lead to close <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> The results show that close interactions between bicyclists and buses are relatively frequent on both types of analysed bus lanes. Close <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> (a bus <b>overtakes</b> a bicyclist with a lateral distance less than 1. m) as well as close bicycle-following situations (a bus drives behind a bicyclist with a time gap less than 2. s) are quite common on both analysed bus lanes. The analyses could not confirm the hypothesis that a sufficiently narrow bus lane is safer than a wider bus lane. On the contrary, close interactions seem even slightly more common on the narrower bus lane. Slightly more close <b>overtaking</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> take place on the narrower bus lane, but the difference is not statistically significant. Additionally, more bicycle-following situations take place on the narrower bus lane because overtaking is more difficult. The results show that buses often maintain a close time gap in these situations. The overtaking speed of the buses is, however, significantly higher on the wider bus lane compared to the narrower one. Moreover, the presence of a bus has an influence on the behaviour of bicyclists. Bicyclists who get overtaken by a bus ride more closely {{to the edge of the}} road than bicyclists who are not in interaction with a bus. While the road design guidelines assume that bicyclists take up a width of one meter from the edge on bus lanes shared with bicyclists, the observations show that bicyclists take up much less space while being overtaken. The presence of a bus does not have a significant influence on the standard deviation of the lateral position of the bicyclist. On the narrower bus lane, some findings suggest that bicyclists who are involved in an interaction with a bus ride faster than bicyclists who are not involved in an interaction with a bus...|$|R
