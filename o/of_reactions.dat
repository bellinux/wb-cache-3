Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E

30|$|This study reexamined the {{kinetics}} <b>of</b> the condensation <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> hydroxymethylphenols {{with the}} purpose <b>of</b> elucidating the <b>reaction</b> mechanisms. This report discusses experimental results on the self-condensations of 2, 4 -dihydroxymethylphenols (2, 4 -DHMP) and 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxymethylphenol (THMP), focusing on the order <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> The relations between the initial rates <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> and the initial concentrations of reactants were investigated. Results quite {{different from those of}} previous reports were obtained. The order <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> the selfcondensation of 2, 4 -DHMP was found to be 1.1, which did not change with the alkali/ 2, 4 -DHMP molar ratio. The order <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> the self-condensation of THMP was found to vary with both the concentration of THMP and the alkali/THMP molar ratio. In the region of THMP concentrations above 1.5 mol/l, the order <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> was confirmed to be 2.0, which did not change with the alkali/THMP molar ratio. In the region of THMP concentrations below 1.0 mol/l, the order <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> varied with the alkali/THMP molar ratio, showing fractional numbers of 1.2 – 1.6. These results indicate that unimolecular reaction(s) and bimolecular reaction(s) take place simultaneously as the ratedetermining step in the condensation <b>reactions</b> <b>of</b> 2, 4 -DHMP and THMP and that the reaction mechanism changes with the species of reactant and, in some cases, with the reaction conditions.|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> was {{discussed}} {{many times in}} physical chemistry journals and books.

5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the extent <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> thermoset elasto-mers was developed based on equilibrium swelling and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The extent <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> was defined based on the molecular weight between crosslinks (Mc) of a polymer sample in relation to Mc {{at the onset of}} gelation and at complete reaction. The molecular weight between crosslinks was measured using equilibrium swelling, whereas rheology and DMA were used to determine the exact point <b>of</b> gelation and <b>reaction</b> completion, respectively. The extent <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>of</b> poly(1, 8 -octanediol-co-citrate) at various polymerization conditions was investigated and this method was used to study the relationship between mechanical properties, molecular weight between crosslinks, and extent <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> VC 2008 Wiley Periodicals...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish molecularity from order <b>of</b> <b>reaction.</b> The order <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is an empirical quantity determined by experiment from the rate law <b>of</b> the <b>reaction.</b> It {{is the sum of}} the exponents in the rate law equation. Molecularity, on the other hand, is deduced from the mechanism <b>of</b> an elementary <b>reaction,</b> and is used only in context <b>of</b> an elementary <b>reaction.</b> It is the number of molecules taking part in this reaction.|$|R
5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} sensation {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>reactions.</b> One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units.

The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The specific set <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> differs among organisms, but a common {{feature is the}} generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E

5|$|Since {{both the}} {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} are used in these linked sets <b>of</b> <b>reactions,</b> the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number <b>of</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number <b>of</b> <b>reactions</b> and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells.
