5|$|Although Wipha did not {{directly}} impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP10.3million ($211,000USD). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP5million ($103,000USD). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado spawned by the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September16. Another man drowned in a flood swollen river on September21. Three <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> listed as missing after being swept away in a river swollen by Wipha.|$|E

5|$|Amin retaliated {{against the}} {{attempted}} invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972, by purging {{the army of}} Obote supporters, predominantly those from the Acholi and Lango ethnic groups. In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the Jinja and Mbarara barracks. By early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and {{at least twice as}} many civilians, had disappeared. The victims soon came to include members of other ethnic groups, religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the River Nile.|$|E

While <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera on a tripod and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E

5|$|Upon making landfall, the {{tropical}} storm produced strong winds {{over a wide}} area. The strongest winds were reported by a station in San Antonio, Texas, which reported 40mph (65km/h) winds, {{far removed from the}} storm's center; these strong winds were likely due to squalls. Heavy rainfall was also reported, though the rains mainly occurred to the east of the passing tropical cyclone. Precipitation peaked at 10in (254mm) in Ville Platte, Louisiana. The tropical storm produced three tornadoes over the Southern United States which collecitvely caused $39,000in damage and caused two fatalities. Two of the tornadoes formed in Mississippi while one formed in Louisiana. Several <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> also injured by the tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people are injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supercell}} {{moved through}} Nashville {{and the environment}} became favorable again, a tornado touched down to the southwest of Castalian Springs in Sumner County, Tennessee, just after 10:00 pm CST (0400 UTC). This {{was the beginning of}} a devastating, long-track EF3 tornado that would go on to kill 22 people and become the deadliest of the outbreak. At the beginning of the path, damage was relatively minor and limited to snapped trees and damaged roofs. However, the tornado rapidly intensified to EF3 strength as it tore directly through Castalian Springs, destroying numerous homes and businesses. The town's post office was completely leveled, mobile homes were obliterated, and several block-foundation homes were leveled or swept away. The 19th century Wynnewood Inn, a national historical landmark and stagecoach stop, suffered major damage to its second floor and grounds during the storm. 11-month old Castalian Springs resident Kyson Stowell survived being thrown from his family's home and carried through the air by the tornado as the structure was completely destroyed. Kyson was found unharmed in an open field, nearly 500 feet away from where he originated. Kyson's mother, Kerri Stowell, was killed in the tornado. A total of 85 homes were destroyed along this portion of the tornado's path. Seven fatalities were confirmed in Castalian Springs, and 14 <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> injured.|$|E
