5|$|Split custody is an {{arrangement}} whereby one parent has full-time custody over some children, and the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> has full custody {{over the other}} children.|$|E
5|$|Even in a {{joint custody}} arrangement, parents may follow a more {{conventional}} division of parenting time. For example, children may spend weekends and some holidays with one parent, but spend most weekdays with the <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1998, Meredith's team {{realized}} that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel {{but rather that}} one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.|$|E

5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical custody provide for a more equal time share between parents.

5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick to pawn her off onto the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypotheses}} that conservative religious <b>parents</b> {{differ from}} <b>other</b> <b>parents</b> {{if it comes}} to parenting and parenting support, was tested using data from 976 parents with children between 0 and 18 years old in the community Nunspeet, the Netherlands. The survey was about parenting, wishes and demands for parenting support. One-Way Anova’s, Independent- sample T tests and multiple regression analyses, indicated that conservative religious parents experience more stress than <b>other</b> <b>parents.</b> They are more worried about themes like obedience, aggressive behaviour and social contacts. They are also more worried about their children going to church and confirmation classes. The same percentage of conservative religious <b>parents</b> as <b>others</b> <b>parents</b> wishes advice or support in the future, {{but when it comes to}} parenting support, conservative religious parents significantly chose less available forms of advice and support then <b>other</b> <b>parents.</b> It seems to be that there are barriers that keep conservative religious parents away from parenting support. Further qualitative research would be effective to find out what those barriers are. Research for concrete wishes and demands from these parents {{if it comes to}} parenting support is necessary...|$|R

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend {{to stay close to}} one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

25|$|Most plants {{inherit the}} {{plastids}} from only one parent. In general, angiosperms inherit plastids from the female gamete, whereas many gymnosperms inherit plastids from the male pollen.

25|$|Inheritance of {{multiple}} mutations tends to infer more serious disease.
