5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E
5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring flew to Sicily {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> reinforced Sicily with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by flying boat on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.|$|E

5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Brian {{had never}} gotten over {{the end of}} his {{relationship}} with Jillian, Lauren encourages him to let her know about his still-strong feelings for her. Brian uses Jillian's wedding as this opportunity, interrupting the ceremony to passionately profess his love for her. Jillian, however, tells Brian (gently) that he had his chance and blew it, as she decided to move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> needs to as well. Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E

5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|Wallace had {{financial}} difficulties {{throughout much of}} his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and Charles Lyell, he had no family wealth to fall back <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.|$|E

25|$|While {{living in}} London in 1768, he {{developed}} a phonetic alphabet in A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. His new alphabet, however, never caught <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> eventually lost interest.|$|E
25|$|Beaumarchais's {{business}} deals dragged <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{spent much of}} his time soaking up the atmosphere of Spain, which would become a major influence on his later writings. Although he befriended important figures such as the foreign minister Grimaldi, his attempts to secure the contracts for Duverney eventually came to nothing and he went home in March 1765. Although Beaumarchais returned to France with little profit, he had managed to acquire new experience, musical ideas, and ideas for theatrical characters. Beaumarchais considered turning the affair into a play, but decided to leave it to others—including Goethe, who wrote Clavigo in 1774.|$|E
25|$|Hildyard {{was a more}} regular {{player in}} a weaker Oxford side in 1885 and was awarded a second Blue. In the match against MCC he {{increased}} his personal best score to 62. Then against Surrey at Oxford he scored an unbeaten 50 after Oxford {{had been made to}} follow <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> followed that in the return match against Surrey at The Oval with 62 not out, which with the earlier score against MCC was the highest score of his entire first-class career. In the 1885 University Match, he made 13 and 18. As in 1884, he played without much success for Lancashire after the university term was over.|$|E

He had been greeted with a hostile reception from the White Witch after arriving at her castle alone, {{and even more so}} after informing her that Aslan had come to Narnia. The harshness of the Witch's winter had made Edmund realise that he had been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side to be <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> realised the full extent of her evil when he witnessed her turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia - much to the Witch's horror after she had banished him.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Garrick, who {{had been}} educated at Lichfield Grammar School, {{enrolled}} in Samuel Johnson's Edial Hall School. Garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> appeared in a school production around {{this time in the}} role of Sergeant Kite in George Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer. After Johnson's school was closed, he and Garrick, now friends, travelled to London together to seek their fortunes. Upon his arrival in 1737, Garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both London and Lichfield with David taking the London operation. The business did not flourish, possibly due to Garrick's distraction by amateur theatricals. Playwright Samuel Foote remarked that he had known Garrick to have only three quarts of vinegar in his cellar and still calling himself a wine merchant.|$|E
25|$|Vettore Cappello {{was born}} to Giorgio Cappello and Coronea Lando. The date of his birth is unknown; his epitaph records that he {{died at the age}} of 63, but when he was inscribed at the Balla d'Oro in 1420, he is {{recorded}} as being twenty years of age, and serving as a sailor in the trade convoy to Alexandria. His family was engaged in commerce, and Vettore appears to have been active in his family's commercial interests: along with his brothers, he maintained agents at Bruges and London for a decade from 1431 <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was patrono (responsible for the equipping and manning of a trade galley) in the muda (annual trade convoy) to Flanders in the years 1428, 1438, and 1441.

25|$|The inaugural North v South {{match was}} held at Lord's Cricket Ground on 11 & 12 July 1836 and the North won by 6 wickets to confirm their {{capability}} and potential. Barker took ten wickets in the match and scored the most runs with 25 and 12 not out. The North's victory caused a sensation and a return match was quickly organised. This took place at Barker's Ground in Leicester and the South won by 218 runs. Redgate for the North and William Lillywhite for the South took twelve and eleven wickets in the match respectively, but the outstanding performance was an innings of 125 not out by Alfred Mynn despite a serious leg injury sustained in practice. His condition worsened as the match went <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> had to withdraw. With insufficient medical resources locally, Mynn was lifted onto {{the roof of a}} stagecoach and secured there to be taken to London, where he was admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital. The surgeon considered amputation but decided against it and Mynn was able to resume his cricket career in July 1838. Mynn's injury raised the issue of leg guards which were generally frowned upon at the time, but the legalisation of roundarm bowling in 1835 meant that bowling was much faster than formerly and, gradually, pads were introduced.|$|E
