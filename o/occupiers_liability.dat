2500|$|Occupiers' Liability {{is another}} example. Governed by the <b>Occupier's</b> <b>Liability</b> Acts, 1957 and 1984 whereby an occupier, {{such as a}} shop owner, who invites others onto land, or has trespassers, owes a minimum duty of care for people's safety.

50|$|At common law, in {{the case}} of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their {{premises}} varied depending on whether a person was classified as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions. For example, England enacted the <b>Occupiers</b> <b>Liability</b> Act 1957. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of Rowland v. Christian, the Supreme Court of California replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to all persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the California Legislature enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.|$|E
40|$|Public {{access to}} the Irish {{countryside}} for walking and recreation generally is a contentious issue. Increased affluence, mobility and changing values have brought about increased demands with respect to recreation in the countryside. There is also {{a greater emphasis on}} consumption demands for goods and services in rural areas. However, provision of a walking product has not been without problems in Ireland. This paper focuses on how public access provision for recreational walking might be enhanced by exploring the situation and precedent in a cross section of European and other developed nations and by examining the concerns of landowners especially with regard to public liability. Supply side factors affecting public access provision are examined in an economic context and a discussion is offered on how the supply might be improved. In the absence of compulsion through legislation, which seems unlikely in an Irish context, this paper contends that the supply of public access is dependent on factors such as cost of provision, potential monetary incentives and landowner preferences. Finally, a change to the <b>Occupiers</b> <b>Liability</b> Act to a definitive enter at your own risk situation would help dissipate liability concerns. peer-reviewedDepartment of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{the doctrine}} of occupiers’ liability {{for the safety of}} child trespassers has been developed in English Law over the last 100 years by applying Pierre Bourdieu’s theorising on the operation of the ‘juridical field’ (Bourdieu 1987). The analysis traces the evolution across the ‘no duty’ dictum of Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) –v- Dumbreck (1929), the ‘duty of humanity’ advanced in British Railways Board –v- Herrington (1972), the qualified duty of care introduced by the <b>Occupiers</b> <b>Liability</b> Act 1984 following the Law Commission, Report on Liability for Damage or Injury to Trespassers, Cmnd 6428 (1976) and the subsequent interpretation of that duty in case law such as Tomlinson –v- Congleton Borough Council (2002) and Mann v Northern Electric Distribution Ltd (2010). The paper analyses {{the ways in which the}} judiciary’s operation as an ‘interpretive community’ (Fish, 1980; 1989) has steered this evolution and the ways in which external, supra-juridical, factors have also influenced how occupiers’ liability law has been interpreted and applied. The analysis is based upon a doctrinal and narrative analysis of the key cases, policy and legislative instalments. This analysis includes assessment of how child trespassers have been depicted and their motivations interpreted by English judges; evaluation of the impact of the 1984 Act; the influence of parallel developments in other common law jurisdictions and the interaction of occupiers’ liability law with other ‘safety’ based legislation. The analysis shows how within the broad policy and legal framework set by legislators, the common law and the 1957 and 1984 Occupiers’ Liability Acts, the courts have marked out (and pragmatically adjusted) the limits of the ‘reasonable’ safety provision required of occupiers for lawful visitors and trespassers...|$|E

The House of Lords ruled that the fencing around the railway was adequate, and the girl had voluntarily {{accepted}} the risk by breaking through it. In the second case, a student who had broken into a closed swimming-pool and injured himself by diving into the shallow end was similarly held responsible for his own injuries. The third case involved a man who dived into a shallow lake, despite the presence of [...] "No Swimming" [...] signs; the signs were held to be an adequate warning.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Occupier's</b> <b>Liability</b> Act 1957 imposes {{upon the}} {{occupier}} a duty of care. The occupier must [...] "take such care {{as in all}} {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The standard of care an occupier is expected to meet is the standard of [...] "a reasonable occupier", no different from the usual common law negligence standard of care. Under Australian Law the Scope and content of a duty of care depends on 6 main factors. (1) magnitude of the risk as perceived by the reasonable occupier;(2) degree of probability of its occurrence;(3) expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking precautions;(4) obviousness of the harm;(5) type of occupier(6) degree of the entrant’s skill or knowledge.|$|R

The initial surge of cases after the {{enactment}} of the federal Crown Liability Act in 1953 [...] mirrored also in developments at the provincial level [...] were typically 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 tort claims. Indeed a significant percentage of claims against the federal government continue to be nothing more than automobile accident, <b>occupier</b> <b>liability</b> claims and lawsuits arising out of similar relatively minor bureaucratic error. Recently, however, as a result of both the imagination of litigators and the growth of the regulatory state, claims against governments have extended to claims for recovery of economic losses related to the negligent enforcement of building regulation, the negligent failure to resolve labour disputes in the federal civil service, the negligent regulation of financial institutions, and the failure to enact regulations establishing oil and gas royalties payable to Indian bands...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{case study}} on the {{management}} of the grounds of a city-fringe pub to explore land and premises owners’ perception of, and responses to, the legal requirements and risks of public access to their property. The paper examines how an approximate lay notion of occupiers’ liability is acquired and used from an actor’s ‘internal point of view’ (Hart 1994). The study set out to empirically explore the suggestion (e. g. Jones 1984; Bennett & Crowe 2008) that landowners’ expressions of concern about potential occupiers’ liability for visitor injuries may function as a polite and acceptable proxy for a more visceral (and less publically expressible) sense of proprietorship but actually found something more prosaic. In the case study the ‘liability risk’ theme was invoked through copious cautionary signage by a premises manager who showed little overt anxiety about liability or safety and no strong proprietorial orientation towards his land. To make sense of this conundrum the paper develops a theoretically informed interpretation of the case study which draws upon Bourdieu’s notion of the guiding hand of ‘habitus’ (2005), Mutch’s (2000, 2001 and 2003) and Pratten’s (2007 a, b and c) work on the constancies and changes within UK pub management, Berger & Luckmann’s (1971) concept of the ‘sedimentation’ of knowledge, Delaney’s (2010) call for holistic, multi-disciplinary, ‘nomospheric investigations’ when studying spatio-legal behaviour, Sack’s (1986) notion of the ‘space clearing’ function of territoriality and Altman’s (1975) highlighting of the importance of express normative declarations for ambiguous ‘secondary territories’ that are neither wholly public nor private. Through this synthesis insight is given into how a form of thinking and acting about law, liability and proprietorship can become embedded and replicated without needing at any stage a consciously developed self-understanding of that action. The paper considers the implications of this for land and premises management and the study of legal cognition within lay professional communities.

40|$|Modern law often {{rests on}} the {{assumption}} that a uniform cost/benefit formula is the proper way to determine fault in ordinary contract disputes. This Article disputes that vision by defending the view that different standards of fault are appropriate in different contexts. The central distinction is one that holds parties in gratuitous transactions only to the standard of care that they bring to their own affairs, while insisting on the higher objective standard of ordinary care in commercial transactions. That bifurcation leads to efficient searches. Persons who hold themselves out in particular lines of business in effect warrant their ability to achieve uniform standards, while individuals who seek favors from their friends are incentivized to choose them carefully given the subjective standard of care. These results, moreover, derive from the Roman conceptions of care brought into the Anglo-American law through the 1703 decision in Coggs v. Bernard, and are shown to have surprising durability in dealing with agency, medical malpractice, <b>occupier</b> <b>liability,</b> guest statute and frustration cases. Often the efficient standard of fault is given only to those who do economics without really trying...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} to negligence liability of the obviousness {{of a risk}} of injury {{has been the subject}} of a case law "explosion" in recent years. This article analyses the application of this concept, at common law and under the tort reform legislation, to an <b>occupier's</b> <b>liability</b> for failing to warn of risks arising from premises or the activities conducted upon them. Particular regard will be had to: the policy underpinning this area of law; the High Court’s decisions in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council; Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council; and more generally, Neindorf v Junkovic; and the interaction between obvious risk and claimant inadvertence in determining breach and standard of care. Whilst the legislative reforms' impact is investigated throughout, the article concludes by arguing, with reference to the term's legislative definition and the decisions in Dederer v Roads and Traffic Authority, that the difference between the significance of "obviousness" at common law and under the reforms is not as great as the legislation suggests. Furthermore, similarly to the common law, whether a risk is obvious, and the relative weight afforded to the factors impacting upon this assessment (such as the potential for claimant inadvertence), remains uncertain and hard to predict...|$|R
500|$|A {{warning of}} danger {{is to be}} taken into account when working out if the common duty of care has been breached. Section 2(4)a says that [...] "where damage is caused to a visitor by a danger of which he had been warned by the occupier, the warning is not to be treated without more as absolving the <b>occupier</b> from <b>liability,</b> unless in all the {{circumstances}} it was enough to enable the visitor to be reasonably safe". Warning may discharge the common duty of care, as in Roles v Nathan, this is not enough unless the visitor can still be reasonably safe. In Rae v Mars (UK) Ltd [...] it was held that where danger is extreme or unusual, it not enough for there to be a warning; a barrier or additional notice should be placed. Staples v West Dorset District Council [...] established that where a danger is obvious and the visitor is able to appreciate it, there is no need for a warning sign.|$|R
500|$|Section 2(5) of the Act {{provides}} {{that there is}} no liability for [...] "risks willingly accepted as his by the visitor", an application of volenti non fit injuria. An occupier can also restrict or exclude liability via a notice providing warnings and conditions of entry, although under section 65 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) this cannot exclude liability for death or personal injury due to negligence where the premises are occupied for the business purposes of the occupier. Before CRA it was treated differently; in Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [...] 1 QB 409 the Court of Appeal held that an <b>occupier</b> could exclude <b>liability</b> by displaying a notice disclaiming as such, even if the claimant had not read the notice. This provision of the Act has been heavily criticised by commentators.|$|R
