40|$|The {{method for}} {{determining}} the voltage security operation limits in a practical voltage security analysis (VSA) system based on VSAT software for large power systems is introduced in this paper. These operation limits include bus voltage limits, branch/corridor transfer power limits and P-load limit of the whole system. The voltage security operation limits {{are determined by the}} most critical contingency among the studied contingency set. The most critical contingency determines the P-load limit of the whole system, and all kinds of <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> limits are <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> values corresponding to this P-load limit under pre-contingency. An <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> limit is upper limit if the function relationship between this <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> and load power is an increasing curve, or lower limit if the function relationship between this <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> and load power is an decreasing curve. These <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> limits are helpful for operators to monitor the system operation state. © 2005 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

30|$|One <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> {{and three}} {{controlled}} design parameters were selected as input variables: mud pressure, elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and void ratio. Mud pressure {{is a well}} <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> that represents the mud weight commonly applied to maintain well integrity during drilling and extraction process. It is {{also referred to as}} the bottom-hole pressure. The magnitude and gradient of this pressure must exceed the formation pressure gradient to avert the inflow of formation fluid to the wellbore and well breakout; however, excessive mud pressure increases the potential for tensile fracturing and fluid loss. The elastic modulus and Poisson ratio are deformation parameters that dominate control of the rock strain characteristics, particularly at the elastic range. The void ratio is a measure of consistency and packing of the rock grains and can be used to estimate porosity, specific gravity, density and saturation.|$|E

30|$|<b>Operation</b> <b>parameters</b> (fracturing fluid {{viscosity}} and injection rate) {{would significantly}} affect the fracture propagation and penetration behavior. Appropriate viscosity {{as well as}} injection rate would ensure a large vertical propagation distance of the fracture and increase {{the possibility of a}} fracture network forming. Too low a viscosity or injection rate of fluids would cause leakage through weak planes and as a result forming multiple fractures with limited fracture height. Too high a viscosity or injection rate of fluids would lead to forming a single fracture with lower SRV. Additionally, comparing with <b>operation</b> <b>parameters,</b> the natural weak plane characteristics (such as development of weak planes and distribution) of coal were the main controlling factor.|$|R

At present, however, the practical utility of such annotations {{is limited by the}} small number of service annotations available for general use. Manual annotation of services is a time consuming and thus expensive task, so some means are required by which services can be automatically (or semi-automatically) annotated. In this paper, we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> based on their connections to other (annotated) <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> within tried-and-tested workflows. Because the data links in the workflows do not necessarily contain every possible connection of compatible parameters, we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters. We show that despite their imprecise nature these so-called loose annotations are still of value in supporting the manual annotation task, inspecting workflows and discovering services. We also show that derived annotations for already annotated parameters are useful. By comparing existing and newly derived annotations of <b>operation</b> <b>parameters,</b> we can support the detection of errors in existing annotations, the ontology used for annotation and in workflows. The derivation mechanism has been implemented, and its practical applicability for inferring new annotations has been established through an experimental evaluation.
