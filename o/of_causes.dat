5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations, with populations in {{disturbed}} environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland. This {{has been attributed to}} a range <b>of</b> <b>causes.</b> Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} the {{different points of}} view on the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> (consideration) in contract in the Serbian doctrine of civil law as until the adoption of the Law on Obligations in 1978. Having in mind that the Law, adhering to the normative solutions of the French Civil Code, explicitly regulates the institution <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract, as one of the conditions of formation and validity of contract, its adoption can certainly be considered as an event of a watershed importance in respect of the analysis of various theoretical points of view on the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract in the Serbian literature. The fact that the institution <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract had not been explicitly regulated in Serbian positive law as until the adoption of Law on Obligations had its effect on the evolution of doctrine in this period in two ways. On one hand, the range of differing theoretical points of view was very wide, covered as good as all the relevant streams in the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>cause,</b> from the ones accepting this institution (so-called causalistic theories) to the ones denying its legal significance in any sense (so-called anticausalistic theories). By the adoption of the Law on Obligations in 1978 the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract became a legal institution in Serbian positive law that {{had a profound impact on}} the evolution of doctrine. On one hand, the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract was not a neglectable legal notion any more, therefore it seems entirely logical that there is as good as no authority since then who has not dedicated to the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract an article or two, or at least a separate part in their textbooks. On the other hand, the determination of the legislator to assign the Serbian legal system to the family of legal systems in which the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract is stipulated as one of conditions of formation and validity of contract, led to the shrinkage of the diapason of various, often conflicting, points <b>of</b> view on <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract in the Serbian literature. In contrast to the period before the adoption of the Law on Obligations, after its adoption a tendency of abandonment of points of view disavowing any legal relevance <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract can be recognized and the majority of contemporary authorities argue that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract is a necessary legal institution, although they may differ in the conceptual determination of this notion. In the period after the adoption of the Law on Obligations in the Serbian literature of law of contract many authorities analyzed various aspects <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract, especially Professors Stojan Cigoj, Ljubiša Milošević, Živomir Đorđević, Boris Vizner, Martin Vedriš, Želimir Šmalcelj, Jakov Radišić, Slobodan Perović, Jožef Salma, Oliver Antić and others. The author in this paper gives an overview of the points of view of authorities in the Serbian literature of law contract on the notion <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> contract who marked the period until the adoption of the Law on Obligations, namely the works of Professors Dragoljub Aranđelović, Živojin Perić, Lazar Marković, Andrija Gams, Stevan Jakšić, Vladimir Kapor and Mihajlo Konstantinović...|$|R

Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

Although the economic Panic of 1893 had a number <b>of</b> <b>causes,</b> President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act {{to be a major}} factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E
