Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often {{there will be an}} easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
