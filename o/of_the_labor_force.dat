5|$|During {{the civil}} war and the ensuing Soviet war in Afghanistan, most of the country's {{infrastructure}} was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The Gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and malnutrition and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E

Between 1990 and 2006 the value of taxable sales increased from $4.8million to $15.5million, and between 1990 and 2014 the unemployment rate fell from 4.2percent to 1.4percent. Formerly vacant buildings house boutiques, gift shops, antique and craft shops; the town also has five art galleries, a library, three parks and two museums, including the Mine Museum run by the Jerome Historical Society, and a former church building that houses the society's offices and archives. Annual events include a home tour ("Paso de Casas") in May, a reunion for former mining families in October, and a Festival of Lights in December.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected {{to work on the}} most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E

25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a modern economy is diversification and an advanced division of labor. By the mid-17th century under 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> was employed in agriculture, whereas 30 percent was engaged in a highly diversified industrial sector, the balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> being engaged in commerce and other service industries. The numerous cities formed a complex web of interdependencies, with the lesser ports performing specialized functions to the major ones; the industrial towns specializing in specific types of production; the countryside becoming highly differentiated by agricultural specialization, with the villages evolving into service centers (or later sometimes centers of outsourced industrial production). However, the integration of specialized agriculture and industry with the growing entrepôt functions of the ports (at least before these functions became disaggregated again in the 18th century) imparted a special dynamism to the Dutch economy during the Golden Age economy.|$|E
