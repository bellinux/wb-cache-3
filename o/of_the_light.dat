5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> on the detector. The resulting intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E

The first chapter discusses <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play, <b>the</b> historical context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era in which the play was written, and presents a broad analytical perspective on <b>the</b> dramatic elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text. The second chapter details the conceptual approach to the production and explains the research and preliminary ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> design. <b>The</b> third chapter focuses on <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> design, emphasizing <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design through the technical and dress rehearsals. The final chapter is an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production and self-evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> design...|$|R

5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
