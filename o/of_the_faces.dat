5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> look green.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with any or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could {{reduce the number of}} faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E

30|$|Changes in {{lighting}} conditions mainly lead {{to changes}} in the brightness and contrast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image. After <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are obtained. In order to more accurately analyze <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> illumination on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image and <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image are processed separately. <b>The</b> high-frequency component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image represents detailed information such as texture and edge, and <b>the</b> high-frequency information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image is mainly reflected in <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes, the nose, the lips, the mouth, <b>the</b> wrinkles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>the</b> skin color changes. When the brightness and contrast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are changed, <b>the</b> low-frequency components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> change and <b>the</b> high-frequency components change a little. Therefore, when the illumination causes <b>the</b> grayscale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image to change, <b>the</b> high-frequency <b>face</b> image is basically unaffected, mainly affecting <b>the</b> low-frequency <b>face</b> image. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> image is transformed by the wavelet transform multi-resolution feature to realize <b>the</b> separate processing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-frequency component and <b>the</b> high-frequency component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, so that <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image not only contains useful information of face recognition but also avoids <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> illumination.|$|R

5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Mont Blanc massif {{does not}} contain any species that are endemic to it, there are many rare and legally {{protected}} species found within its four major habitat zones. These are the: montane forests, sub-alpine, alpine and nival zones. The major habitats are coniferous forests, moors, rock and talus slopes, plus glacial moraines. The biological richness is further influenced by the different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces,</b> by the geology, and by the influence of man on the lower and middle slopes where forest clearance has created open grassland. The native forest habitats are essential {{for the survival of}} many species, with the key conifer species including larch, pine, stone pine and red pine.|$|E
5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found that the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To retain {{the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing {{in the shape of the}} face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E
30|$|We applied PCA on {{a subset}} <b>of</b> markers: in <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> (jaw, lips, and cheeks - see Figure 1). <b>The</b> {{movements}} <b>of</b> markers on <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are tightly {{connected to the}} speech gestures. As this synthesis technique was designed for neutral speech (affirmative sentences) and not expressive speech, markers on <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> move very little. We retained the 12 first principal components, which explain about 94 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} pressure period, being {{similar to}} the coal wall spalling at <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> coal wall spalling decreased with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>face</b> advance speed in <b>the</b> middle part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> spalling ratio showed a trend of non-linear decrease with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>face</b> advance speed.|$|R
50|$|Initial facial changes usually involve <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{covered by}} <b>the</b> {{temporal}} or buccinator muscles. The disease progressively spreads {{from the initial}} location, resulting in atrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin and its adnexa, as well as underlying subcutaneous structures such as connective tissue, (fat, fascia, cartilage, bones) and/or muscles of one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> mouth and nose are typically deviated towards <b>the</b> affected side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

50|$|Facial {{bilateral}} symmetry is measured via fluctuating asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> comparing random differences in facial features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> that develop and accumulate throughout one's lifetime {{as a result}} of stressors.|$|R
40|$|Hills and Lewis (2006) reduced White participants’ own-race bias (ORB) in face {{recognition}} by training them {{to attend to}} features critical for Black <b>faces</b> (lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face).</b> Here, <b>the</b> ORB was investigated following a brief fixation cross either in <b>the</b> upper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> (critical for White <b>faces)</b> or <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Results showed that when the cross preceded <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> Black faces were recognized more accurately than White faces and vice versa when it preceded <b>the</b> upper portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> A second experiment demonstrated that this effect disappears if the participants are forced to delay their responses by 4 s. These results suggest that an immediate attentional mechanism can attenuate the ORB when immediate {{attention is paid to}} diagnostic features but this can be overridden with increased time spent viewing face...|$|R

25|$|The {{octahedron}} {{is unique}} among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, {{it is the}} only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|E
30|$|Due to <b>the</b> peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{shape and}} {{variability}} of several aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> recognition problem {{is different from}} the other object recognition problems. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous work used <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> local as well as global representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> descriptors to solve this problem. Multi-resolution histograms of local variation pattern [10] is one such method which describes <b>face</b> images as <b>the</b> concatenation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local spatial histogram of local variation patterns computed from multi-resolution Gabor features.|$|R
