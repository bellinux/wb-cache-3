50|$|In {{the time}} which had elapsed during the {{incident}} {{and as the}} car was being repaired, the 3 litre Ariès had slipped past and was beginning to establish a sizeable lead. Benjafied set about reducing the French cars advantage, pushing the Bentley hard despite running with only <b>one</b> <b>headlamp</b> and a flashlight strapped to the windscreen frame to guide him through the dark of night. By midday on Sunday they had reduced Laly and Chassagnes lead to only a single lap, assisted by a few mechanical maladies which afflicted the French car in the pits. The Ariès had a fault with its ignition system, which had resulted in lengthy delays during driver changes, and on its 122nd lap the system failed completely, stranding Chassagne out on the circuit. With its only remaining rival now out of contention, Benjafield and Davies completed the remaining time of the race at greatly reduced speed, nursing the injured Bentley home. They won the race having completed only 1472 miles (2369 km), {{at an average of}} just over 61 mph (98 km/h), far fewer than the record, set the previous year, of 1586 miles (2552 km).|$|E
40|$|Headlamps with high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{sources have}} been available on vehicles sold in the U. S. for a little over ten years. Although estimates of the proportion of HID headlamps in the vehicle fleet can be made based on sales data, there are uncertainties in those estimates {{because of lack of}} comprehensive compilation of data, unknown retention rates in the fleet, and complex regional differences in sales. Furthermore, number of vehicles sold and/or registered is not necessarily predictive of vehicles in use because of possible differences in overall driving rates or, most importantly, in nighttime driving rates. This study was therefore designed to obtain direct measurements of the proportion of vehicles with HID headlamps in nighttime traffic. Eight sites (two in each of four metropolitan areas) were selected, and traffic at those sites was video recorded between the hours of 7 : 00 p. m. and 10 : 00 p. m. The observations were made in late February and early March 2008, when those evening hours were dark and virtually all vehicles had their headlamps on. Video recording was done with diffraction gratings mounted on the cameras so that the type of headlamps—HID or tungsten-halogen (TH) —could be easily discriminated by the spectrally dispersed headlamp images. Investigators later scored the videos, counting the numbers of vehicles (except for motorcycles) in terms of headlamp type (HID or TH), and number of headlamps on (both, one, or none). The proportions of vehicles with HID headlamps varied by more than an order of magnitude, from 0. 0151 to 0. 200, across the eight sites. The proportion of HID headlamps did not vary over time within the three-hour observation periods. The proportions of TH-equipped vehicles with <b>one</b> <b>headlamp</b> not functioning varied from 0. 0018 to 0. 0129 across the eight sites...|$|E

Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.The Southern Pacific and Cotton Belt were the only buyers of the EMD SD45T-2 [...] "Tunnel Motor" [...] locomotive. This locomotive was necessary because the standard configuration EMD SD45 could not get a sufficient amount of cool air into the diesel locomotive's radiator while working Southern Pacific's through snow sheds and tunnels in the Cascades and Donner Pass. These [...] "Tunnel Motors" [...] were EMD SD45-2's with radiator air intakes at the locomotive car body's walkway level, rather than EMD's typical setup with fans on the locomotive's long hood roof pulling air through radiators at the top/side of the locomotive's body. Inside tunnels and snow sheds hot exhaust from lead units would accumulate {{near the top of the}} tunnel or snow shed and be drawn into the radiators of trailing EMD (non-tunnel motor) locomotives, leading these locomotives to shut down as their diesel prime mover overheated. The Southern Pacific also operated EMD SD40T-2s, as did the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.|$|R
40|$|Headlamps with high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) sources {{produce more}} light than lamps with tungsten-halogen (TH) sources. The extra light offers {{the possibility of}} improving a driver’s ability to see at night, which in turn may lead to better safety. Because low-beam headlighting necessarily involves a tradeoff between seeing and glare control, the extra light has also {{raised questions about the}} glare from HID headlamps. However, photometric analyses of the possible benefits of HID headlamps suggest that, in terms of the test points in U. S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 (FMVSS 108), HID headlamps achieve both greater seeing light and lower glare levels. The fact that HID lamps produce less glare in formal terms is at odds with the popular impression that they are more glaring than TH <b>headlamps.</b> <b>One</b> possible {{reason for this is that}} the test points in FMVSS 108 represent headlamp performance in static terms, without explicitly considering vehicle movement and road geometry. In contrast, the Comprehensive Headlamp Environment Systems Simulation (CHESS) model that was developed in the 1970 s by Ford Motor Company is an attempt to evaluate headlighting performance under a wide range of real-world conditions. In this study, we applied the CHESS model to headlamps from surveys of U. S. headlighting for the 2004 model year that included TH and HID lamps. The results indicate that: (1) HID headlamps as a group achieve substantially higher scores than TH lamps in terms of the CHESS overall figure of merit, which is intended to balance seeing and glare effects, (2) TH lamps produce a large range of discomfort glare effects and the HID lamps are within that range, although at the high end, and (3) differences among lamps, and the advantage of HID lamps over TH lamps, are more pronounced in the CHESS subscales that are intended to measure pedestrian visibility than in the CHESS overall figure of merit...|$|R

In-depth accident {{studies have shown}} that perceptual errors made by other vehicle drivers are a very frequent cause of motorcyclists' accidents and fatalities. Two kinds of perceptual errors can be distinguished. The first one is no or late detection of the motorcycle, which is mainly due to its low visual conspicuity (especially because of their small size). The principal safety measure in the past has been the use of daytime running lights (DRLs) by motorcycles, which became compulsory in the seventies in many countries. This conspicuity advantage of motorcycles as the only vehicles with DRLs is presently getting lost by the growing use of DRLs by cars as well. In an earlier study we have shown that car DRLs are actually competing light patterns that create visual noise and decrease the detectability of motorcycles. The second kind of perceptual error, less well known, is the misperception of the approaching motorcycle's speed (which is underestimated) and time-to-arrival (which is overestimated) that also contributes to accident occurrence. In order to reduce motorcycle accidents, and especially to improve motorcycle perceptibility (both detection and speed perception) by other vehicle drivers, ITS based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication will probably provide effective long-term solutions (> 15 years). But until then, other solutions have to be found and could quite easily be implemented, by considering innovative headlight configurations for motorcycles. In two simulator studies, we tested various motorcycle headlight configurations, intended for remedying simultaneously the two perceptual errors made by other vehicle drivers. The impact of different headlight configurations (using colour coding and additional lights) was studied in the presence of visual distractors (car front lights: only LEDs, only dipped beams, LEDs and dipped beams) and in different illumination conditions (nighttime, dusk and daytime conditions). The results of the first study on motorcycle motion perception indicated that headlight configurations that accentuate the vertical dimension of the motorcycle (additional lights on the fork and on the rider's helmet) led automobilists to adopt larger safety margins towards motorcycles. The advantage provided by the innovative headlight configuration showed up especially at low illumination conditions (night and dusk) where the motorcycle outline was not visible or difficult to perceive. On the contrary, a triangular design (with two additional lights on the handlebars) showed no significant improvement. The findings of the second study on motorcycle detection showed that additional yellow lights (on the motorcyclist's helmet and the motorcycle fork) significantly improved motorcycle conspicuity and produced the best motorcycle detection performance, even {{in the presence of a}} great number of competing car headlights (when LEDs and dipped beams were lit at the same time). When combining the results of our studies, we suggest a motorcycle headlight configuration that consists in <b>one</b> white central <b>headlamp,</b> an additional yellow light on the helmet and two additional yellow lights on the fork.

La communication a porté sur le projet Avimoto qui s'est intéressé à la perceptibilité des motocyclistes. Deux expériences ont été présentées, abordant les deux principales erreurs perceptives (erreur de détection et mauvaise perception du mouvement du motocycle) faites par les autres conducteurs lors de leur interaction avec des motocyclistes. Plusieurs configurations de feux avant de moto ont été testées sur simulateur, débouchant sur la recommandation d'une configuration consistant en un feux central blanc et 3 feux additionnels jaunes sur le casque du motard et la fourche de la moto. Cette configuration a montré être capable de remédier simultanément aux deux types d'erreurs perceptives mentionnées plus haut...|$|R
