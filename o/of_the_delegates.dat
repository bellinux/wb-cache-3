5|$|The {{sovereignty}} convention {{gathered at}} the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18, 1861. Burnett also presided over this convention. Fearing for the safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates,</b> he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8, 1862, but Scott County's George W. Johnson convinced the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> to continue. By the third day, the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower {{on the campus of}} Bethel Female College, a now-defunct institution in Russellville.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> had trained as lawyers (several {{had even been}} judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception}} of Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. George Washington and Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the convention, Mason {{supported}} much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more powerful than the states.|$|E
5|$|Most of the book's {{scientific}} chapters {{were reviewed}} by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring to many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates,</b> and promoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's {{rejection of the}} Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson {{with some of the}} material included in her chapter on herbicides).|$|E

5|$|On September 8, 1913, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} sixteenth {{biennial}} national encampment convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> took a river steamer trip {{the next day}} and went up the Delaware River from the Arch street wharf to Port Richmond. They were shown various piers and shipbuilding yards and stopped at League Island. Colonel H. Ogden Lake was presented as the next commander of the national organization, since Commander Downs retired from the position. There were about a thousand delegates that attended this convention.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian Diet {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Gyalu in August. The {{representatives of the}} noblemen of the Partium (the counties between the Tisza and Transylvania) also consented to a war against the Ottoman Empire in November. However, the Habsburgs' army was unable to recapture Pest or defeat the Ottomans. Caspar Serédy came to Gyalu to take possession of John Sigismund's realm on Ferdinand's behalf, but Isabella refused him on 17December. Three days later, the Diet declared the Treaty of Gyalu null and void, over the objections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> of the Transylvanian Saxons.|$|E
5|$|The second {{agreement}} was again {{regarded as a}} provisional compromise by both parties. The charter prescribed that a joint delegation of the rebels and the noblemen {{should be sent to}} the king, who was staying in Prague, to seek his arbitration. There is no evidence of the appointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> or their departure for Prague. Sigismund of Luxemburg died on 9 December 1437.|$|E

5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories {{to all three of}} the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E

50|$|As of October 1, 2006, Dion had {{captured}} approximately 17% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegate</b> spots {{available for the}} December leadership convention in Montreal. This resulted in his entering the convention in fourth place behind Ignatieff, Rae and former Ontario Education Minister Gerard Kennedy.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|At {{the state}} {{convention}} in June 1816 Jennings may have informed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> {{that he intended}} to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy. Thomas Posey, Indiana's last territorial governor, was Jennings's opponent. Posey announced his own candidacy for governor prior to the convention's adjournment on June 29, 1816. With just five weeks before the August 5 election, there was little active campaigning. Posey, who thought Indiana statehood was premature, was not a popular candidate and suffered from health issues. Jennings won by a large majority, 5,211 votes to 3,934. Most of Jennings's votes probably came from the eastern portion of the state, where his support was particularly strong, while Posey's probably came from the western portion. Jennings moved to the new state capital at Corydon, where he served the duration of his term as governor.|$|E
50|$|Hoover's {{managers}} at the Republican National Convention, which met in Chicago between June 14 and 16, ran a tight ship, not allowing expressions <b>of</b> concern for <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation.

50|$|At the Democratic National Convention held in Institute Hall in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1860, 51 Southern Democrats {{walked out}} over a {{platform}} dispute. The extreme pro-slavery “Fire-Eater” William Lowndes Yancey and the Alabama delegation first left the hall, followed by <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> <b>of</b> Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>delegates</b> from Arkansas, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>delegates</b> from Delaware.|$|R

Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would {{have a say in}} the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one who}} went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections procedures were offered, the process of selecting the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> came from areas that are now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as from areas that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, political groups, government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E
5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>delegates</b> were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
