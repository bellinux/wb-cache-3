40|$|We {{consider}} "unphysical", kinematic <b>observables</b> {{that do not}} commute {{with the}} constraints of a gauge system {{in the context of}} an extension of the system. We show that these <b>observables,</b> while not predictable, can nevertheless be said to have a physical interpretation. They implement Rovelli's concept of partial and relational <b>observables.</b> We investigate the propositional structure of these <b>observables</b> and point out interpretational issues.

5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each <b>observable</b> is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an <b>observable</b> corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the <b>observable</b> in that eigenstate.|$|E

For background independent field theories we will show that partial and complete <b>observables</b> can be related to Kuchaˇr’s Bubble Time Formalism [2]. Moreover one can define a non-trivial gauge action on the space of complete <b>observables</b> and also state the Poisson brackets of these functions.
