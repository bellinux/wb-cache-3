25|$|Mainly, {{this is an}} {{attribute}} of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are most electropositive <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{because they have a}} single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.|$|E
25|$|The {{implication}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial {{step in the}} creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, 'God's revenge' on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
25|$|The outcome <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} {{kinetics}} of the NaV channels {{are governed by}} a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way. Since these channels themselves {{play a major role}} in determining the voltage, the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out. Hodgkin and Huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states, known as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. These equations have been extensively modified by later research, but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics.|$|E

25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E

500|$|Iñárritu {{has made}} a special point of {{emphasizing}} the importance of historical issues of ethnicity approached in the film and reflected in the mixed ethnic background of Hugh Glass's son portrayed in the film (portrayed as half Pawnee by Glass's wife) as relating to his own life and his identification with ethnic concerns. Iñárritu has referred to having encountered constant xenophobia and stated that: [...] "These constant and relentless xenophobic (comments) have been widely spread by the media without shame, embraced and cheered by leaders and communities around the U.S. The foundation <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so outrageous that it can easily be minimized as an SNL sketch, a mere entertainment, a joke ...

50|$|A key {{component}} to making sense <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to simply recognize {{that all these}} issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.|$|R
500|$|... "Three Words" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it [...] "extremely well-performed by all concerned." [...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is never {{going to be the same}} again". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B", although she felt that by this stage the series' mythology was moving [...] "in concentric circles of pain and confusion".|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Another cost is {{the excess}} energy and time {{expenditure}} {{that comes with}} mating. For example, female water striders, Gerridae, [...] and marine snails of the genus Littorina 24 have to carry the males on their backs while they mate. First <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a great loss of energy. Second, both the male and the female are at a much greater risk of predation in this position. Furthermore, the time spent mating interferes with the time {{that could have been}} spent foraging [...] and feeding.|$|E

2500|$|Blainey and {{his family}} were subject to threats of violence, {{prompting}} him at the police's request to remove his name and address from the public telephone book and organise security for his home. According to fellow historian Keith Windschuttle: [...] "The immediate consequence <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that Blainey, easily Australia's best and most prolific living historian, was effectively silenced from speaking at his own university.... This violation of academic freedom, clearly the worst in Australian history, provoked no protest at all from the university's academic staff association, nor from the university council, let alone his own departmental colleagues." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cromwell led a Parliamentary {{invasion}} of Ireland from 164950. Parliament's key opposition was the military {{threat posed by}} the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged {{to be the biggest}} single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the royalist alliance, and Protestant royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said {{in a speech to the}} army Council on 23 March that [...] "I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the most dangerous".|$|E
2500|$|The result <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{that only}} 16 episodes {{remained}} in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including {{the first and last}} episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, [...] "D For Destruction", thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, in the BBC Archives in a mislabelled film can. It has been shown in public at the Missing Believed Wiped event, and is included in the [...] "Complete Collection" [...] DVD set.|$|E
2500|$|The Introduction closes with Arthur – still {{refusing to}} claim that the play is real – facilitating its {{publication}} anyway. Arthur meditates on the artificiality of endings, and points out that the reader's reaction to The Tragedy of Arthur rests on how they interpret the story told in the Introduction. He sums up the project by claiming that those [...] "who know [...] personally know to a fine degree how much <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true, how much an apology (and how sincere), how much a boast or a con job. To the rest of you, it's a muddle or it's a thing of beauty.

50|$|After {{the fall}} of Manerplaw the KNU also lost its stronghold just north of it called Kawmoora. A direct result <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that the KNU lost most of its income derived from tax revenue, logging deals and {{cross-border}} trade. The loss of its financial base was also due to changing international relations. The threat of Communism disappeared in the 1990s, thus the US and Thai government changed policies. When the KNU attacked an oil pipeline in Karen state in 1995, the US government gave an official warning to the KNU for the first time.|$|R

2500|$|While for {{an outside}} {{observer}} the harmonic innovations in bebop {{would appear to}} be inspired by experiences in Western [...] "serious" [...] music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing, and {{it is also true that}} Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz. But bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions.|$|E
2500|$|In present day, the {{residents}} discover that Grif has disappeared, but Arthur, {{who had his}} squire killed, kept silent about his [...] "whereabouts." [...] Henry, on the other hand, believes {{the only way to}} stay positive in light <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to hold a dance, which in turn was a way to ask Violet out. At the same time, Emma continues to make a real man out of Gold without telling him exactly why she needed him. Gold tried to tell Emma that being the Dark One would cost her the ones she loved, but she didn’t want to listen. She then brings in Merida to do her bidding and sends them to the woods. Emma, heeding Gold's words, was having second thoughts about everything as she went to her shed full of dreamcatchers and cried. As they arrive in the woods, Merida began putting Gold to work on making him a hero, but he is shown to be weak, which infuriated the Scottish archer from DunBroch. She then finds something that he can fight for by showing him Belle's chipped teacup, then taunts Gold on how cowardly he was, even to Belle. Gold immediately takes the sword and swings at Merida, who stops and tells him that what he did was an act of bravery, he was not thinking about himself or his limp: he was thinking of her. But, [...] she also says that they {{have a long way to}} go so they can kill Emma.|$|E
