He commented, [...] "Wed be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and Id think, <b>Oh</b> <b>shit,</b> because Id know what was coming.

5000|$|Lennon {{claimed he}} wrote the first two lines on {{separate}} acid trips; he explained much of the song to Playboy in 1980: The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko ... I'd seen Allen Ginsberg and some other people who liked Dylan and Jesus going on about Hare Krishna. It was Ginsberg, in particular, I was referring to. The words 'Element'ry penguin' meant that it's naïve to just go around chanting Hare Krishna or putting all your faith in one idol. In those days I was writing obscurely, à la Dylan. ...It never {{dawned on me that}} Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, <b>Oh,</b> <b>shit,</b> I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it? laughing 'I am the carpenter ...' ...|$|E

5000|$|Growing up J. Cole idolized American rapper Nas, even posting his rap verses on his wall. Once J. Cole {{had signed}} to Roc Nation in 2009, he began {{preparing}} his debut album Cole World: The Sideline Story. On May 31, 2010 he released {{the first single}} [...] "Who Dat" [...] which failed to garner commercial success. After that Cole tried harder {{to find a good}} hit record for his record label. Through that long process, Cole had countless meetings with Jay-Z to discuss new songs he had made. Although Jay backed them as good songs, Roc Nation concluded that none of them were hits. Cole explained that soon after all these dead ends, One night I was in this hotel room after a show and I was listening to The College Dropout, as I do. And on the worst song on that album, which is my favorite album, so I'm not dissing. But on the worse song on that album, [...] "The New Workout Plan," [...] I heard the shit that I had been hearing for like—eight years now. I heard it different as a producer like <b>oh</b> <b>shit...</b> made a rough version of the beat right there in the hotel room. By the time I got back to Europe a few days later I had [...] "Work Out".|$|E
5000|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a person named Stanley [...] "Stan" [...] Mitchell who claims to be the biggest fan of Eminem. Stan writes a plethora of letters to Eminem; with each verse he becomes {{gradually}} more obsessed with him, and when there is no reply he becomes progressively angrier. He finally creates a voice recording of himself driving his car into a lake, with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk, as shown in the lyrics: [...] "So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now, doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? See Slim... (Stan's girlfriend screams from the trunk) Shut up, bitch! I'm trying to talk! Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you, 'cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now... <b>Oh,</b> <b>shit!</b> I forgot! How am I supposed to send this shit out?! (car tires squeal, followed by the sounds of the car crashing through the bridge's railing and falling into the river below)" [...] The first three verses are delivered by Eminem as Stan while the fourth verse is Eminem as himself attempting to write to Stan and reason with the troubled young man, only to realize that he had already heard about Stan's death on the news.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oh</b> <b>shit,</b> [I have] said fuck! Oh fuck, [I have] said shit!” Brian Blessed spoke {{these words}} on {{an episode of}} Stephen Fry’s show Planet World (Fry, 2011 b). Why might some people {{perceive}} this sentence as shocking, rude or offensive? For {{the simple reason that}} it contains swearwords. Swearing is not something one is supposed to do and this is told us in, amongst others, the Bible: “But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne : / Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. / Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black” (The Bible, Mat. 5. 34 – 36). Swearing has always been taboo (Montagu, 1967; Stapleton 289). In one of his comedy routines, the American comedian George Carlin talked about the number of swearwords in the English language compared to the total number of words in it: “There are 400, 000 words in the English language, but there are seven of them you cannot say on television. What a ratio that is!” (2011; Pinker, 2008). These seven words are shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. As a reaction to this sketch, the US Supreme Court and the federal government established a law which could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States (Poetry Genius) : if one uttered one of the ‘seven dirty –’ or ‘filthy words’ on television or radio, one had to pay a large fine. The ban has been established about thirty years ago and there is an ongoing debate on whether it should be lifted (Nighty News, 2012). What makes a word an effective swearword? “In order to be useful for the purposes of swearing, a word […] must have reference to an object possessing, or thought to possess, force or power of some kind” (Montagu 15). Many of these words refer to excrement and filth, like shit, or sexual intercourse, like fuck. Not all words can function as swearwords, “because they [lack] the acquired weight of tradition in the speech community” (Hughes, 1992 : 22). All swearwords are therefore emotionally charged terms (Hughes, 1992). Native speakers of English mainly use English words when they swear. Native speakers of Dutch, however, swear both in their native tongue and in English (van de Krol, 2013). Are people these days really offended when someone utters a “filthy word”? Is the perceived rudeness of swearing dependent on factors such as nationality and gender? Do British people perceive swearwords with a different level of harshness than Americans? How do their results compare to people who are native speakers of Dutch? These are questions which this thesis would like to answer...|$|E
