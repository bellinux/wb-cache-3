The following day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals." ...|$|E

[...] He opposed the BBC's spending money on a Nelson Mandela concert in 1988, saying [...] "those who want the arts and who support them should pay for them themselves". He also opposed the government spending on AIDS treatment, saying that the disease was [...] "largely self-inflicted". He was a fan of Elvis Presley and treasurer of the all-party Music Appreciation Group, and a couple of Presley's songs were played at Forth's memorial service in October 2006.|$|E

She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience. [...] Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, [...] "I don't care who you vote for. [...] Do not take this great privilege for granted." ...|$|E

[...] In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying [...] "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog… who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her… Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" [...] Madonna went on to shout, [...] "Support education! Support the people who support women!" [...] Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.|$|E

6000|$|Well, she and {{her husband}} had worked the thing out, and they had come to the {{conclusion}} that what was the matter with the great mass of English people was first that they had rather too much loose money, and secondly that they had rather too much loose time. (A voice: [...] "What O!" [...] and the Rev. Jopling Baynes suddenly extended his neck, knitted his brows, and became observant of the interrupter.) She did not say they had too much money (a second voice: [...] "Not Arf!"), but too much loose money. She did not say they had too much time but too much loose time, that is to say, they had money and time they did not know how to spend properly. And so they got into mischief. A great number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> she maintained, and this was especially true of the lower classes, did not know how to spend either money or time; they bought themselves wasteful things and injurious things, and they frittered away their hours in all sorts of foolish, unprofitable ways. And, after the most careful and scientific study of this problem, {{she and her}} husband had come to the conclusion that two main principles must underlie any remedial measures that were attempted, the first of which was the Principle of Payment in Kind, which had already had so interesting a trial at the great carriage works of East Purblow, and the second, the Principle of Continuous Occupation, which had been recognized long ago in popular wisdom by that admirable proverb--or rather quotation--she believed it was a quotation, though she gave, she feared, very little time to poetry ("Better employed," [...] from Mr. Pope)-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{remarkable}} how dominant is this disposition {{to get a}} phrase, a word, a simple recipe, for an undertaking so vast in reality that for {{all the rest of}} our lives a large part of the activities of us, forty million people, will be devoted to its partial accomplishment. In the presence of very great issues people become impatient and irritated, as they would not allow themselves to be irritated by far more limited problems. Nobody in his senses expects a panacea for the comparatively simple and trivial business of playing chess. Nobody wants to be told to [...] "rely wholly upon your pawns," [...] or [...] "never, never move your rook"; nobody clamours [...] "give me a third knight and all will be well"; but that is exactly what everybody seems to be doing in our present discussion And as another aspect of the same impatience, I note the disposition to clamour against all sorts of necessary processes in the development of a civilisation. For example, I read over and over again of the failure of representative government, and in nine cases out of ten I find that this amounts to a cry against any sort of representative government. It is perfectly true that our representative institutions do not work well and need a vigorous overhauling, but while I find scarcely any support for such a revision, the air is full of vague dangerous demands for aristocracy, for oligarchy, for autocracy. It is like a man who jumps out of his automobile because he has burst a tyre, refuses a proffered Stepney, and bawls passionately for anything--for a four-wheeler, or a donkey, as long as he can be free from that exploded mechanism. There are evidently quite a considerable number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> who would welcome a tyrant at the present time, a strong, silent, cruel, imprisoning, executing, melodramatic sort of person, who would somehow manage everything while they went on--being silly. I find that form of impatience cropping up everywhere. I hear echoes of Mr. Blatchford's [...] "Wanted, a Man," [...] and we may yet see a General Boulanger prancing in our streets. There never was a more foolish cry. It is not a man we want, but just exactly as many million men as there are in Great Britain at the present time, and it is you, the reader, and I, and the rest of us who must together go on with the perennial task of saving the country by firstly, doing our own jobs just as well as ever we can, and secondly--and this is really just as important as firstly--doing our utmost to grasp our national purpose, doing our utmost, that is, to develop and carry out our National Plan. It is Everyman who must be the saviour of the State in a modern community; we cannot shift our share in the burthen; and here again, I think, is something that may well be underlined and emphasised. At present our [...] "secondly" [...] is unduly subordinated to our [...] "firstly"; our game is better individually than collectively; we are like a football team that passes badly, and our need is not nearly so much to change the players as to broaden their style. And this brings me, in a spirit entirely antagonistic, up against Mr. Galsworthy's suggestion of an autocratic revolution in the methods of our public schools.|$|E
