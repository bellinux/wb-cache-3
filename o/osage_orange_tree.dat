In the photo you see one of the tremendous Cedar of Lebanon conifers. There are some <b>Osage</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>trees</b> not far from the property as well. The farm originally encompassed land across the main thoroughfare of Hylan Boulevard, between that road and the beach.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyBiological & Agricultural EngineeringMark E. CasadaRonaldo G. MaghirangWind erosion is an {{important}} problem in many locations, including the Great Plains, {{that needs to be}} controlled to protect soil and land resources. This research was conducted to assess the effectiveness of vegetation (specifically, standing vegetation and tree barriers) as controls for wind erosion. Specific objectives were to: (1) measure sand transport and abrasion on artificial standing vegetation, (2) determine porosity and drag of a single row of <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> (Maclura pomifera) barrier, (3) assess effectiveness of <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> barriers in reducing dust, (4) predict airflow through standing vegetation, and (5) predict airflow and particle collection through <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> barriers. Wind tunnel tests were conducted to measure wind speed profiles, relative abrasion energies, and sand discharge rates for bare sand and for two vegetation heights (150 and 220 mm) at various densities of vegetation. Results showed that vegetation density was directly related to threshold velocity and inversely related to sand discharge. The coefficient of abrasion was adversely affected by saltation discharge but did not depend on wind speed. Field tests measured the aerodynamic and optical porosities of <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> using wind profiles and image analysis, respectively, and an empirical relationship between the two porosities was derived. Vertical wind profiles were also used to estimate drag coefficients. Optical porosity correlated well with the drag coefficient. Field measurements also showed a row of <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> barrier resulted in particulate concentration reduction of 15 to 54 % for PM 2. 5 and 23 to 65 % for PM 10. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software (OpenFOAM) was used to predict airflow in a wind tunnel with artificial standing vegetation. Predicted wind speeds differed slightly from the measured values, possibly due to oscillatory motions of the standing vegetation not accounted for in the CFD simulation. OpenFOAM was also used to simulate airflow and particle transport through a row of <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> barrier. Predicted and measured wind speeds agreed well. Measured dust concentration reduction at two points (upwind and downwind) were also similar to the predicted results...|$|R

In preparation for his marriage in 1847 to Carrie Winder, John McGavock created a 1 acre garden {{to the west of the}} house based on the writings of Andrew Jackson Downing, the “father of American landscape architecture.” The working garden had vegetable squares, each surrounded by ornamental borders, but the presence of a large <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree</b> in the center of the southeast quadrant suggests that vegetable growing was eventually discontinued in garden plots nearest the house. The garden was surrounded by a white picket fence as well as a high board fence on the north side, to protect the plants from animals and severe weather. The fence also gave a degree of privacy to the occupants of the house from the outbuildings and the many slaves moving about on the grounds.|$|E

Two isoflavones, osajin and pomiferin, were isolated from the mature fruit of M. pomifera in high purity (≥ 95 %). Testing of purified osajin and pomiferin failed to show repellency. Repellency is likely caused by factors other than isoflavones in the fruit...|$|E
50|$|The first Anglo-American {{settlers}} in the region were Tom Hubbard and his family, who came from Mississippi in 1851. They began farming along Harvey Creek which formed part of a land grant to Henry Austin, cousin of Stephen F. Austin. A major influx of Scotch-Irish and English immigrants from Laurel, Mississippi arrived in a 36-wagon caravan in 1855. After building homes and bringing in the first harvest the following year, their leader Dr. Samuel D. McLeary named the community Osage after the <b>Osage</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>trees</b> found in the area. In {{the early part of}} the War Between the States, Osage and other area communities supplied the men who formed Company A of the 5th Texas Cavalry Regiment. In 1862 the town boasted a blacksmith, cotton gin, a number of well-built homes, several stores and a Confederate States of America post office. E. B. Carruth opened a school at Osage in 1874 and it soon became locally famous, drawing students from a 100-mile radius who boarded with area families. However, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad was built west from Columbus and the new town of Weimar was established on the railroad in 1873. Between that year and 1900, every business abandoned Osage and moved approximately 4 mi southwest to Weimar. By the 1980s only a few scattered farms and ranches remained in the area. One source dubs Osage a ghost town.|$|R
50|$|The 149-acre {{property}} is mostly farm land and pasture. It includes {{a large number}} of field stone rock walls (stone fences) in excellent condition. Many wooded tree lines and hedgerows follow field lines depicted on old Civil War-era map sketches. The remnants of many old roadways also remain, evidenced by stonework, fences, tree lines, and bridge abutments. The field lines include numerous large black walnut, hackberry, black locust, honey locust, chinquapin oak, and eastern redcedar trees. The western side of the {{property is}} a steep hill which old photos from the 1930s show as farmed but which are now wooded. A well-preserved abandoned roadway follows a sunken course along the western perimeter of the property. A few <b>osage</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> remain near the roadway and drop their large green tennis ball sized fruits on the ground. The eastern part of the property is a roughly 30-acre tract of pasture land that contains multiple scattered small woodlots, most of which surround abrupt rock outcrops of 20 feet or more. These woodlots, which also show up on 1930s-era aerial photos, are dominated by very large red and white oaks, hickories, and other deciduous trees that may be remnants of virgin tree cover. Several other areas of rock outcroppings support dense patches of eastern redcedar. The Doub Farm pastures, combined with the similar pastures on the adjoining Baker Farm, provide some of the best remaining grassland bird habitat in a region where much of that habitat has been lost to plowing, urbanization, and forest succession.|$|R

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the independent variable}} Exposure, laundering had a different influence than light exposure on color compositions of mordanted and nonmordanted dyed specimens. For black walnut, mordanted and nonmordanted specimens were greener (a*) and bluer (b*) when subjected to laundering (Table  3). Mordanted specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted specimens but only before laundering. After laundering, b* value became similar for both mordanted and nonmordanted. For <b>Osage</b> <b>orange,</b> mordanted specimens were redder (a*) than nonmordanted before laundering, but a* of both became similar after laundering. Mordanted <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> was also yellower (b*) and nonmordanted <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> was bluer (b*) after laundering. For eastern redcedar, specimens turned lighter, redder, and bluer after laundering both for mordanted and nonmordanted. When visually inspecting the specimens, mordanted and laundered <b>Osage</b> <b>orange</b> was a brighter and clearer yellow when compared to nonmordanted.

Other extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon and gomphothere, may have fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal.
