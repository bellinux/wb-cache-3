5|$|Before the Spring Offensive on the Western Front began, the War <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> {{decided to}} {{substitute}} British {{units in the}} EEF with British Indian Army units.

50|$|Many county record <b>offices</b> <b>have</b> issued printed {{guides to}} their collections, {{although}} {{the addition of}} new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many <b>offices</b> also <b>have</b> considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials.

His <b>office</b> <b>had</b> issued an edict that a resident remove her landscape renovations. However, an e-mail campaign {{in defense of the}} resident caused the mayor to rethink his stance.|$|E
5|$|The Hays <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> never officially {{recommended}} banning {{violence in}} any form in the 1920s—unlike profanity, the drug trade or prostitution—but advised that it be handled carefully. New York's censor board was more thorough than {{that of any other}} state, missing only around 50 of the country's 1,000 to 1,300 annual releases.|$|E

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that <b>office</b> <b>had</b> apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|Bondfield {{remained}} {{active in}} NUGMW affairs until 1938, {{and during the}} Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, {{she has not been}} greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, Barbara Castle, Bondfield's actions in <b>office</b> <b>had</b> brought her close to betrayal of the movement.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the company}} had 100 tied houses. In March 1890 Samuel Webster & Sons became a {{registered}} company with £175,000 (£17.5million in 2010) of capital and Isaac Webster, Samuel's eldest son, its first chairman. In 1892 net profit was £20,000 (£2million in 2010). In 1896 the company took over H & T T Ormerod of Brighouse, West Yorkshire which could trace its origins back to 1760.

5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{was posted}} to the Office of the Cable Censor in New York City after {{returning}} to the US {{at the end of}} March 1942. As the <b>office</b> <b>had</b> recently ceased to be an organ of Naval Intelligence, his status was amended to Deck Officer.

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Christmas break, in a faxed letter to NDP {{candidate}} Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the Commissioner of the RCMP, Giuliano Zaccardelli announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her complaint that it appeared Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale's <b>office</b> <b>had</b> leaked information leading to insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. On December 27, 2005, the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release. At {{the conclusion of the}} investigation, Serge Nadeau, a top Finance Department civil servant, was charged with criminal breach of trust. No charges were laid against then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's <b>office</b> <b>had</b> {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} capture of Jerusalem, the British War <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> been very worried about Allenby's {{extended}} advance and warned of a possible retirement back to Gaza and Beersheba if the war on the Western Front dictated the transfer {{of large numbers of}} troops from the Levant. This attitude changed immediately after Jerusalem was captured. The War Office then wanted to know how Allenby might exploit his success {{with the addition of a}} division from Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|On June 23, 2011, in the NBA draft, the Trail Blazers drafted guards Nolan Smith from Duke University {{with the}} 21st {{selection}} and Jon Diebler from Ohio State University with the 51st selection. On the same day, the Blazers front <b>office</b> <b>had</b> made a three-team {{trade with the}} Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks. The trade sent Blazers guards Andre Miller to Denver and Rudy Fernández to Dallas along with international player Petteri Koponen, who had yet to make an appearance for Portland; Denver then sent guard Raymond Felton to Portland and Denver also received rookie forward Jordan Hamilton from Dallas {{as well as a}} future second-round pick from Portland.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field <b>Office</b> <b>had</b> warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E
5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793.
