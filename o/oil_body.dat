In this study, the use of <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> as a flavour delivery agent is evaluated. Fresh aromatized <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> show comparable headspace flavour intensity to phospholipid-stabilized emulsions when in a static equilibrium state, and when evaluated by dynamic headspace dilution, aromatized <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> showed a significantly stronger potential to maintain their headspace volatile concentration, which may indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> would offer greater retronasal flavour delivery than current commercial systems...|$|R

40|$|Soybeans contain <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> {{that are}} {{naturally}} coated by {{a layer of}} phospholipids and proteins. In nature, this coating protects the <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> from environmental stresses and could be utilized by food manufacturers for the same purpose. However, natural <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> are physically unstable to aggregation because of the relatively weak electrostatic repulsion between them, which limits their application in many foods. In this study, <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> were extracted from soybean using an aqueous extraction method and then coated by a pectin layer using electrostatic deposition. The influence of NaCl (0 – 500 mM), pH (2 – 8), and freeze–thaw cycling (− 20 °C, 22 h/ 40 °C, 2 h) on the properties and stability of the <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> coated by the pectin layer was analyzed using ζ-potential, particle size, and creaming stability measurements.

In the present study we investigated the <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> emergence and variations in Brassica napus cv. Topas. The results demonstrate that the oil bodies could be detected already at the heart stage, {{at the same time as}} the embryos began to turn green, and the starch grains accumulated in the chloroplast stroma. In comparison, we have studied the development of oil bodies between Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Col) and the low-seed-oil mutant wrinkled 1 – 3. We observed that the <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> development in the embryos of Col is similar to that of B. napus cv.

40|$|Oleosins {{are major}} {{proteins}} associated with oil storage vesicles known as oil bodies in many plant seeds. These oil bodies and oleosins have recently gained attention, due to potential applications in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The oleosin proteins coat the oil bodies making them very stable. This work studied the characterization and properties of oleosins {{with respect to}} aqueous solubility, <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> separation processing, and edible films and coatings for food products. ^ The effects of salts, solvents, surfactants, denaturants, temperature, and pH on oleosin electrical charge, physical structure, and aqueous solubility were measured along with their effects on <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> suspension stability and <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> integrity. An aqueous separation method for oil bodies was developed based on the observation of rapid <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> coagulation induced by low levels of cationic salts. This non-solvent oil extraction procedure is a promising alternative to current edible oil solvent extraction methods. ^ As highly protective natural barrier proteins for seed oil, oleosin-based edible films were developed to serve as moisture barriers to improve food quality. <b>Oil</b> <b>body</b> films contain both oleosin membranes and oils making them very hydrophobic. The water vapor permeability (WVP) of <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> films was 3. 3 -times {{lower than that of}} soy protein isolate counterparts but 67 % higher than that of zein films. Mechanical properties of <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> films were effectively modified by plasticizing with Tris-HCl, Ca 2 +/Mg 2 + cross-linking, or adding carboxymethyl cellulose. The resulting films had a wide range of tensile strength and elongation properties, varying from 0. 2 MPa and 60 % to 5. 1 MPa and 6 %, and could be engineered for specific packaging applications. More importantly, <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> film-forming mechanisms were illustrated. Oleosins are predominately β-sheet proteins associated through hydrophobic, electrostatic, and Van der Waals interactions to form films. The film-forming process and film-modifying treatments were found to affect the structure of oleosins. Specific secondary structural changes were correlated to changes in the thickness, tensile strength, elasticity, and WVP of the films. Additionally, film storage stability and coating applications to food systems were examined. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>bodies</b> act as lipid storage {{compartments}} {{in plant}} cells.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>bodies</b> were {{observed}} in cells of both embryo and aleurone layers of mature adlay grains (Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf). Stable <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> were successfully isolated from the adlay grains. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the contents stored in the adlay <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> were mainly neutral lipids (> 90 % triacylglycerols and about 5 % diacylglycerols). The integrity of the isolated <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> was presumably maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance provided by their surface proteins.

40|$|Oleosin {{protein is}} {{targeted}} to oil bodies via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{and consists of}} a lipid-submerged hydrophobic (H) domain that is flanked by cytosolic hydrophilic domains. We investigated the relationship between oleosin ER topology and its subsequent ability to target to oil bodies. Oleosin variants were created to yield differing ER membrane topologies and tagged with a reporter enzyme. Localisation was assessed by fractionation after transient expression in embryonic cells. Membrane-straddled topologies with N-terminal sequence in the ER lumen and C-terminal sequence in the cytosol were unable to target to oil bodies efficiently. Similarly, a translocated topology with only ER membrane and lumenal sequence was unable to target to oil bodies efficiently. Both topology variants accumulated proportionately higher in ER microsomal fractions, demonstrating a block in transferring from ER to oil bodies. The residual <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> accumulation for the inverted topology was shown to be because of partial adoption of native ER membrane topology, using a reporter variant, which becomes inactivated by ER-mediated glycosylation. In addition, the importance of H domain sequence for <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> targeting was assessed using variants that maintain native ER topology. The central proline knot motif (PKM) has previously {{been shown to be}} critical for <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> targeting, but here the arms of the H domain flanking this motif were shown to be interchangeable with only a moderate reduction in <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> targeting.

40|$|Background: Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an {{important}} oil crop in the world, and increasing its oil content is a major breeding goal.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here {{we report on the}} seed ultrastructure of an ultrahigh oil content rapeseed line YN 171, whose oil content is 64. 8 %, and compared with other high and low oil content rapeseed lines. The results indicated that the cytoplasms of cotyledon, radicle, and aleuronic cells were completely filled with oil and protein bodies, and YN 171 had a high <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> organelle to cell area ratio for all cell types. In the cotyledon cells, <b>oil</b> <b>body</b> organelles comprised 81 % of the total cell area in YN 171, but only 53 to 58 % in three high oil content lines and 33 to 38 % in three low oil content lines.

40|$|Plant seeds store neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols in {{intracellular}} particles termed <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> {{as energy}} sources for a forthcoming active period of metabolism. Seed <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> contain a triacylglycerol matrix {{surrounded by a}} layer of phospholipids and unique proteins. In the past years, we successfully established the technique for the constitution of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> and intended to develop several biotechnological applications. Seeing the limitation of a single laboratory, we intend to cooperate with experts in different research areas to expand the applications of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies.</b> We proposed to establish three biotechnological platforms in the following three years. (1) To engineer and produce recombinant oleosin or caleosin for the encapsulation of artificial oil bodies: For a better stability in long-term storage, techniques will be developed for solidification of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> in the forms of powder or tablet. (2) To engineer and produce recombinant caleosin for the encapsulation of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> containing functional antioxidant ingredient, curcumin or an anti-cancer drug, camptothecin. The compounds will be tested for incorporation into triacylglycerol homogenously and then constituted into artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies.</b> Bioavailability will be evaluated in rats. (3) To engineer and produce recombinant oleosin or caleosin for the encapsulation of artificial <b>oil</b> <b>bodies</b> to generate antibodies against small molecules, such as catechin ECGC by presenting it on their surface. Different conditions will be tested for the covalent linkage between oleosin/caleosin and the compound. The new engineered oil-body protein {{will serve as a}} platform for the production of antibodies against small compounds. 油體為種子儲存三酸甘油酯做為發芽所需能量之特有胞器。油體構造中，三酸甘油酯被一層磷脂質包覆，此磷脂質層鑲滿豐富的油體特有蛋白質。近年來本研究室成功建立人造油體重組系統，並著手研發其生物科技上的應用性。有鑑於單一實驗室有限的專長與研究能量之不足，本計畫擬結合不同專長的研究專家，共同研發擴大人造油體的應用範圍。規劃三年擬開發下列技術平台：(1) 開發人造油體粉末與錠劑之技術：人造油體技術包埋的食品或藥物，未來產品化時為求其安定性，必須將人造油體包埋的產品固體化，並且不能破壞人造油體的結構。(2) 改造與生產特用人造油體提供開發人造油體包埋藥物之技術：擬測試不同配方嘗試將喜樹鹼、薑黃素均勻融入三酸甘油酯，組成人造油體，再經動物試驗測試包埋效果及評估生體可利用率。(3) 發展利用人造油體技術來生產各種抗小分子抗體的平台：擬以基因工程技術改造適用的新型油體蛋白質，再將小分子，例如生物素(biotin) 、兒茶素(EGCG) ，利用化學反應的方式，連結在油體蛋白上並經人造油體技術表現於人造油體表面。預期可產生較強的免疫反應，且效價較高的抗體...|$|R
