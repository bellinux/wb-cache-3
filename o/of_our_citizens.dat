Shortly after the war, Russian president Medvedev unveiled a five-point Russian foreign policy. The Medvedev Doctrine stated that [...] "protecting the lives and dignity <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>citizens,</b> wherever they may be, is an unquestionable priority for our country". The presence of Russian citizens in foreign countries would form a doctrinal foundation for invasion if needed.

The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris.
