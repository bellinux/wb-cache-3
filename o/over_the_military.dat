5|$|From March 1781, the Congress of the Confederation and the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were {{situated}} at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Under {{the authority of the}} Articles of Confederation, Congress did not have direct control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> except in times of war, and was largely reliant on the use of state militias to enforce laws and keep order.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Mubarak's speech, {{contradictory}} {{reports from}} various media sources {{around the world}} stated that either Suleiman or Tantawi was expected to take <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> <b>military</b> council also met without Mubarak. The Muslim Brotherhood had feared a coup at one point. The head of the NDP said that Mubarak should go {{for the good of}} the country.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E

5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
5|$|The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo {{held their}} final {{demonstration}} in 2006, believing that Kirchner, unlike previous presidents, {{was not their}} enemy. They became political allies of Kirchner, who placed them in prominent locations during his speeches, and the group became a powerful NGO. He further underscored civilian control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> by appointing Nilda Garré — {{who had been a}} political prisoner during the Dirty War — the country's first woman Minister of Defense. As a result of his policies and approach, relations between the civilian authorities and the military remained tense throughout Kirchner's presidency.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{accession}} to the imperial throne, Joseph ruled less land {{than his father}} had in 1740. Believing that the emperor must possess enough land to maintain the Empire's integrity, Maria Theresa, who was used to being assisted {{in the administration of}} her vast realms, declared Joseph to be her new co-ruler on 17 September 1765. From then on, mother and son had frequent ideological disagreements. The 22million gulden that Joseph inherited from his father was injected into the treasury. Maria Theresa had another loss in February 1766 when Haugwitz died. She gave her son absolute control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> following the death of Count Leopold Joseph von Daun.|$|E
5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1938, Hitler used {{blackmail}} {{to consolidate}} his hold <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> by instigating the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair. Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign {{by using a}} police dossier that showed that Blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution. Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship. Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938. Hitler assumed Blomberg's title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces. He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command: OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi. By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.|$|E

5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially {{how to pay for}} them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E
5|$|Thơ also {{retained}} {{a degree of}} influence over domestic economic policies, which ran far behind Diệm's priorities of absolute control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and other apparatus through which he maintained his rule. Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand {{in the administration of}} the Commodity Import Program, an American initiative akin to the Marshall Plan, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, in order to avoid inflation. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to {{the vast majority of the}} imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's economic capacity. Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the opposite of what was recommended.|$|E
5|$|The anti-Khrushchev {{minority}} in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck {{at the heart of}} Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At a 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern day}} ROC {{military}} is styled after western military systems, mostly the US military. Internally, {{it has a}} political warfare branch/department that tightly controls and monitors each level of the ROC military, and reports directly to the General Headquarters of the ROC military, and if necessary, directly to the President of the ROC. This is a carryover from the pre-1949 era, when KMT and its army were penetrated by Communist agents repeatedly and led to frontline units defecting to Communist China. To strengthen their control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and prevent massive defection after retreating to Taiwan in 1949, CKS and CCK employed tight control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> by installing political officers and commissioners down to the company level, {{in order to ensure}} political correctness in the military and loyalty toward ROC leadership. This gave the political officers/commissars a great deal of power, allowing them to overrule the unit commander and take over the unit. Only in recent years has the political warfare department (due to cutbacks) reduced its power within the ROC military.|$|E
