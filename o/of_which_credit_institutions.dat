Such a move was impossible in the case of the Tryggingarsjóður as the remaining Icelandic <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> were far too small in relation to the claims of Icesave depositors, and a fortiori because Icelandic law states that [...] "Member Companies shall not be liable for any commitments entered into by the Fund beyond their statutory contributions to the Fund." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - <b>which</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|R

Credit is the choicest jewel the tradesman is trusted with; it is better than money many ways; if a man has £10,000 in money, he may certainly trade for £10,000, and if he has no credit, he cannot trade for a shilling more.|$|R
40|$|We apply copula {{functions}} to evaluate counterpart risk in swap transactions. Using copulas allows to generalise the approach proposed by Sorensen and Bollier (1994), allowing for dependence between swap rates and counterparty default [...] Counterpart risk {{is represented by}} a sequence <b>of</b> vulnerable swaptions, <b>which</b> are priced using Cherubini and Luciano (2002) approach. Using copulas grants maximum flexibility with the choice of term structure and default risk models, {{as well as with}} the specification of the dependence structure between interest rate and credit risk. Closed form hedging and pricing formulas are derived for extreme dependence cases and for copula functions of the Fréchet family. An empirical application based on actual market data has shown that dependence affects both the level and the slope credit spreads, particularly for the case in <b>which</b> a <b>credit</b> <b>institution</b> is paying fixed. The effect is reversed in the case in which the financial institution pays floating. ...|$|R
