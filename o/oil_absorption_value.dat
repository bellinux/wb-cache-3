Results of the exposure test on acrylic solvent based paints after 500 hours shows Maya type pigments have superior performance as compared to Ultramarine blue and slightly inferior performance as compared against Copper Phthalocyanine Blue.

40|$|In potato {{processing}} the common cooking methods are frying and roasting. During frying several chemical and physical changes take place, including {{oil and water}} interaction which {{is related to the}} heat-mass transfer phenomena wherefrom the nutritional quality of the product is changed. The aim of the research was to evaluate <b>oil</b> <b>absorption</b> by roasted and fried potatoes. <b>Oil</b> <b>absorption</b> and water loss of five common Latvian potato varieties Lenora, Brasla, Imanta, Zile and Madara was evaluated A two-year research was conducted during two periods: just after harvesting and after six months of storage. Three commonly used cooking methods were applied: deep fat frying, shallow frying and roasting in oven. Time-temperature was controlled. Fat content in fried potatoes in 100 g of DW by the types of frying differs significantly (p < 0. 001). A close linear correlation was found between the fat content and moisture (R 2 = 0. 815) ...|$|R
