5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} important {{causes of}} premature mortality among Aboriginal {{adults in the}} Northern Territory (NT), 1979 - 1991. METHODS: All <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> NT Aboriginal residents aged 15 - 64 years which occurred in the NT between 1979 and 1991 and which were recorded by the Registry <b>of</b> Births, <b>Deaths</b> <b>and</b> Marriages were included. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were {{used to compare the}} number <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> observed among Aboriginals in the NT to those expected, based on overall Australian rates. Years of potential life lost before age 65 (YPLL 65) were estimated for specific causes <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> RESULTS: Aboriginal women (overall SMR, 5. 5) and Aboriginal men (SMR, 4. 7) experienced a high burden of excess mortality from almost every cause <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> This excess increased over time, especially for Aboriginal women. Among Aboriginal men, the most important causes <b>of</b> premature <b>death</b> were motor vehicle accidents (11 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 17 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), ischaemic heart disease (10 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 10 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), pneumonia and influenza (8 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 6 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), and homicide (7 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 8 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65). For Aboriginal women, the most important causes included homicide (7 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 11 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 5 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), rheumatic heart disease (7 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 8 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65), and ischaemic heart disease (6 % <b>of</b> excess <b>deaths</b> <b>and</b> 5 % <b>of</b> YPLL 65). CONCLUSIONS: The wide variety of causes of excess mortality will require an equally wide variety of solutions, both medical and non-medical, and a long term commitment will be necessary to achieve reductions in premature mortality among NT Aboriginal adults...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{inquiries}} into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47-year-old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid-1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow as a cleaner and to look after the licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green. Police believed at first that she had died of natural causes. An autopsy failed to establish a cause <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> her body was returned to Ireland for burial.|$|E
