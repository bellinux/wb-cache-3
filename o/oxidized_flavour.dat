40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quality of Omaze Uozongombe, a traditional Herero community Ghee in Namibia in order to improve it for commercial purposes. Ghee is not well known and not found in the formal market in Namibia, except from the Herero community who live their lives around cattle in the rural Namibia. The traditional ghee is made from fermented milk that has been incubated for 2 - 3 days at ambient temperatures in a seeded calabash containing roots of Omunkunzi (Boscia albitrunca) tree in order to speed up the fermentation process, add flavour and to assist in the churning process. The resulting fermented milk is churned by shaking the calabash for 1 - 2 hours to obtain butter. The butter is scooped off, washed, boiled and clarified into a golden yellow product (Ghee). The Ghee is then packed in recycled metal or plastic containers. Traditional ghee in Namibia is characterized by short shelf life, high moisture and sediment contents, rancid taste and <b>oxidized</b> <b>flavour.</b> Samples of traditional and laboratory made ghee were analyzed for physico-chemical and sensory characteristics for quality comparison, extension o...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{reports on}} the main problems decreasing productivity of dairy cows (e. g. fatty liver syndrome and poor fertility) and how antioxidants could enhance it. High producing dairy cows are prone to oxidative stress, and the situation can be exacerbated under certain environmental, physiological, and dietary conditions. Antioxidants have important effects on the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant status, which may enhance animal health and reproduction. Moreover, antioxidants may contribute to decrease the incidence of spontaneous <b>oxidized</b> <b>flavour</b> in milk enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Plant lignans are strong antioxidants and flax is the richest source of plant lignans. Flax lignans are converted in the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol. The main mammalian lignan in milk is enterolactone and flax lignans are converted in enterolactone mainly under the action of ruminal microbiota. Therefore, ruminal microbiota {{may be the most}} important flora to target for plant lignan metabolism in order to increase concentration of mammalian lignan antioxidants in milk of dairy cows. However, more research is required to improve our knowledge on metabolism of other antioxidants in dairy cows and how they can contribute in decreasing milk oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous <b>oxidized</b> <b>flavour</b> (SOF) is an {{off-flavour}} in milk {{that has}} received attention {{in only a few}} countries, primarily due to lack of monitoring. The poly unsaturated fatty acids in milk are considered to make it more prone to oxidize, with effects like shorter shelf life of dairy products and a reduction in consumer acceptance of milk. On the other hand, unsaturated fatty acids have a reputation of being healthier than the saturated fatty acids. Means to optimize the fatty acid composition of milk include breeding measures, why acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), a major gene for milk fat content, has lately attracted a lot of research efforts. The risk of milk to develop SOF showed a strong and positive association with milk concentrations of both the well known prooxidant copper and its substrate the poly unsaturated milk fatty acids. The observed statistical interaction between copper and fatty acid composition suggests that SOF will not develop as easily in milk with high copper content unless sufficient amounts of substrate is available to promote the oxidation process. Breed and selection for fat content had an effect on the composition of milk fat where milk from Swedish Holstein cows generally had larger amounts of poly unsaturated fatty acids compared to the Swedish Red cows in the two selection lines in the SLU research herd. Selection for high milk fat content was associated with lower concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The selection for fat content created differences in allele frequencies of the DGAT 1 gene between selection lines, with a higher frequency of the 232 A allele within the low fat line. DGAT 1 genotype was associated with both composition of milk fat and occurrence of SOF, with the A allele being associated with a higher proportion of the polyunsaturated fatty acid CLA and an increased susceptibility of milk to develop SOF. The observed genetic variation in occurrence of SOF indicates that it may become a milk quality issue should bulls become selected that happen to carry genotypes predisposing for milk sensitive to oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The chief {{reason for}} storing butter in cold storage {{is to ensure}} a supply of good butter {{throughout}} the year. Most butter goes into storage in May, June and July, the season of the year which is best suited to cream production because of the freshening {{of the majority of}} the cows at this time, also the succulent condition of the pasture. Under normal conditions the bulk of butter in storage is taken out within nine months. Only in exceptional cases is butter held in storage over one year, and when this is done it is usually accompanied by a great sacrifice in quality and price. In order to justify storage and to have the storing of butter fulfill the purpose for which it is intended, the butter must be protected against agents and conditions which cause it to deteriorate in quality. By deterioration in butter is meant any change in flavour that will tend to make it less valuable. The chief conditions injurious to the quality of butter in storage are air, light, heat and humidity. Air and Light: It is a well known fact that prolonged exposure to air damages the flavour of butter and the changes brought about are believed to be due chiefly to oxidation. This oxidizing action is intensified in the presence of light. This fact can easily be proven by placing a sample of butter in direct sunlight and it will be found to rapidly acquire an <b>oxidized</b> or tallowy <b>flavour</b> and appearance. The tendency in storage is usually toward a tallowy character which begins on the surface and progresses toward the centre of the package. Heat intensifies every type of butter deterioration. It hastens oxidation and the action of bacteria and enzymes; it also favours mold development, and chemical activity. Butter that is intended for prolonged storage should be stored at a temperature of zero degrees Fahr, or lower. At higher temperatures its keeping quality is jeopardized and the poorer the quality the more rapid will be the deterioration with age. It not only assists in flavour deterioration, but the mold spots must be removed which means a lot of labour and loss of butter in the scraps. In commercial cold storages the air is dry, but when butter is removed from such a storage moisture frequently condenses on the surface. When such butter is held for a few days at temperature above freezing, mold may develop and cause serious loss. Thus storage at temperatures above freezing should always be in a dry atmosphere if possible. Storage does not improve the quality of butter, rather the flavour tends to deteriorate with age. The deterioration is usually retarded and only very gradual at the low temperatures of commercial cold storage. The exact changes responsible for the development of specific flavour defects have not been determined in the great majority of cases. It is assumed with reasonable certainty, however, that rancidity and tallowiness are due to the cleavage of the butterfat, rancidity to hydrolysis through bacterial or enzymatic action, or both, and tallowiness to oxidation through chemical means. Butterfat, on account of its relatively high percentage of the lower fatty acids, especially butyric, readily produces a strong odour characteristic of these acids upon slight hydrolysis. Most other fats contain relatively small amounts of the lower fatty acids and a larger amount of the higher acids, such as palmitic and stearic which are less susceptible to hydrolysis. Fishiness in butter was first thought to be due to bacterial decomposition but now is supposed to be the result of the hydrolysis of lecethin, forming trimethylamine. The work done for this thesis was to find out what types of bacteria had survived for six years, rather than to determine any specific defect that they might have caused. The sample of butter worked with had been kept in commercial cold storage for a period of six years and it was found that it had developed a tallowy appearance during this time...|$|R
