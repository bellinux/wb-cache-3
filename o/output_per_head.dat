The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe.

50|$|The primary {{relationship}} between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited.This gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the existing wage rate.A large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in disguised unemployment in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth.|$|E

5000|$|Agricultural Involution: The Processes of Ecological Change in Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous of the early works of Clifford Geertz. Written for a {{particular}} US-funded project on the local developments and following the modernisation theory of Walt Whitman Rostow, Geertz examines in this book the agricultural system in Indonesia. The two dominant forms of agriculture are swidden and sawah. Swidden is also known as slash and burn and sawah is irrigated rice paddy. The geographical location of these different types is important. Sawah is the dominant form in both Java and Bali where nearly three quarters of Indonesia's population live and swidden more common in the less central regions. Having looked at the agricultural system the book turns to an examination of the systems historical development. Of particular note is Geertz's discussion of what he famously describes as the process of [...] "agricultural involution". This is his description of the process in Java where both the external economic demands of the Dutch rulers and the internal pressures due to population growth led to intensification rather than change. What this amounted was increasing the labour intensity in the paddies, increasing output per area but not increasing <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
40|$|GDP {{figures for}} Africa are unreliable. More {{dependable}} {{information can be}} found in government expenditure and international trade records. These records, though, provide little insight into non-market output. In this paper an attempt is made to draw explicit conjectures on real <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> in preindependence Africa on the basis of trade data so that conjectures can be established about Africa’s long-run growth. Two alternative approaches are considered. One estimates per capita GDP by assuming no increase in <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> outside the tradable sector, for which the purchasing power of per capita exports is accepted as a proxy. Another approach establishes an econometric association between real per capita GDP and the income terms of trade per head for 1950 - 1990 and, {{on the basis of the}} prediction equation’s parameters and the values of the RHS variables, infers real <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> for 1870 - 1938. Trends in real <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> are then drawn for Africa (and its main regions). By comparing these trends with those from other developing regions, some conjectures about Africa’s relative position over time are put forward. It emerges that economic growth started earlier than usually assumed and there is continuity in growth before and after colonial independence. Sub- Saharan Africa’s retardation is a gradual process, as growing and falling behind took place simultaneously. But it is in the period 1975 - 1995 when the worst setback in modern Africa’s history took placeFinancial support from Fundación Rafael del Pino’s research project on "Economic Freedom in History" is gratefully acknowledge...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{agriculture}} in Spain's contribution to the little divergence in Europe. On the basis of tithes collected by historians over the years, long-run trends in agricultural output are drawn.

The demand contraction, resulting from the collapse of domestic markets, monetary instability, and war in Iberia, helps to explain a less intensive use of labour and land as incentives to produce for the market sharply diminished. Agricultural <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>head</b> moved along population up to 1750. This finding confirms the view of Spain as a land abundant frontier economy.

When sub-optimality {{is caused by a}} lack of human capital at the steady state, a minimum wage or a redistribution policy makes it possible to increase <b>output</b> <b>per</b> capita and to reduce inequality because both increase the educated share of the population by raising certain households above the trap. These policies only need to be implemented over one period of time, i. e. one generation. Moreover, the sooner they are laid down, the more efficient these policies become. Finally, the income <b>per</b> <b>head</b> at the steady state is higher when individuals have myopic rather than perfect expectations.
