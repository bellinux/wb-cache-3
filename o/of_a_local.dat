5|$|Beaumaris Castle {{was taken}} by Welsh forces in 1403 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr, but was recaptured by royal forces in 1405.

Despite forming part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> royalist rebellion in 1648 the castle escaped slighting and was garrisoned by Parliament, but fell into ruin around 1660, eventually forming part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> stately home and park in the 19th century. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction.|$|E

40|$|For <b>a</b> <b>local</b> {{endomorphism}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> noetherian <b>local</b> ring we introduce <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> entropy, {{along with}} two other asymptotic invariants. We use this notion of entropy to extend numerical conditions in Kunz' regularity criterion to every contracting endomorphism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> noetherian <b>local</b> ring, and to give <b>a</b> characteristic-free interpretation <b>of</b> the definition of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. We also show that everyfinite endomorphism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete noetherian <b>local</b> ring of equal characteristic can be lifted to afinite endomorphism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete regular <b>local</b> ring. The <b>local</b> ring <b>of</b> <b>an</b> algebraic or analytic variety at a pointfixed by afinite self-morphism inherits <b>a</b> <b>local</b> endomorphism whose entropy is well-defined. This situation arises at the vertex of the fine cone over a projective variety with a polarized self-morphism, where we compare entropy with degree...|$|R

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> alignment.|$|E
