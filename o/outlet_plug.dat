40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} to determine sulfite in beer samples using a fill and flow channel biosensor. A droplet of sample is placed into the inlet of a rectangular flow cell {{and begins to}} flow through the channel by capillarity. The flow is maintained and controlled by a porous <b>outlet</b> <b>plug</b> of defined porosity. In a rectangular flow cell, the sample solution flows through three consecutive zones: over a predictor electrode, an enzyme layer and a detector electrode. Together these three zones enable the differentiation between current due to sulfite and current due to other electroactive species in the sample. The predictor electrode is located upstream, and on the opposite channel wall to the enzyme layer and detector electrode, and is poised at the same potential (+ 0. 65 V versus Ag/AgCl) as the detector electrode. On this electrode, the current contribution from all species in the sample solution that are oxidized at that potential is determined. The enzyme layer contains sulfite oxidase, which, {{in the process of}} oxidizing sulfite, produces hydrogen peroxide, which itself is reduced by excess sulfite. The current at the downstream detector electrode is therefore different from that at the predictor electrode {{as a result of the}} enzyme reaction and the difference of the currents, corrected for the dimensions of the electrodes, is proportional to the concentration of sulfite. The method enables a straightforward correction of the interfering current at the detector electrode and a determination of the analyte concentration. The effect of interferences from ascorbic acid, ethanol, sorbic acid and tartaric acid in the detection of sulfite is efficiently removed. The concentration of sulfite in a sample of beer measured by the biosensor is equivalent to that measured using a reference method based on the AOAC-recommended Monier-Williams method. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{pilot study}} evaluates the {{effectiveness}} of a community based childhood injury prevention program on the reduction of home hazards. METHODS: High risk pregnant women, who were enrolled in a home visiting program that augments existing health and human services, received initial home safety assessments. Clients received education about injury prevention practices, in addition to receiving selected home safety supplies. Fourteen questions from the initial assessment tool were repeated upon discharge from the program. Matched analyses were conducted to evaluate differences from initial assessment to discharge. RESULTS: A significantly larger proportion of homes were assessed as safe at discharge, compared with the initial assessment, for the following hazards: children riding unbuckled in all auto travel, Massachusetts Poison Center sticker on the telephone, <b>outlet</b> <b>plugs</b> in all unused electrical outlets, safety latches on cabinets and drawers, and syrup of ipecac in the home. CONCLUSIONS: A community based childhood injury prevention program providing education and safety supplies to clients significantly reduced four home hazards for which safety supplies were provided. Education and promotion of the proper use of child restraint systems in automobiles significantly reduced a fifth hazard, children riding unbuckled in auto travel. This program appears to reduce the prevalence of home hazards and, therefore, to increase home safety...|$|R

5000|$|Many early {{examples}} of the 'All-American Five' posed a shock hazard to users. Lacking a mains transformer, the chassis of the AA5 radio was directly connected {{to one side of}} the mains electric supply.

2500|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark <b>plug</b> <b>outlets</b> and a plastic valve cover. The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design.

40|$|With the {{increase}} of heat flux densities generated by electronics, manufacturers are facing tremendous new challenges in which component heat flux might reach 100 W/cmÂ². This scenario is pushing the research efforts towards the development of alternative solutions, which {{will be able to}} ensure the needed cooling demands of high-integrated electronics. Furthermore, when considering the aeronautical applications, the reliability, compactness, and lightness of the cooling systems represent essential and mandatory characteristics. With the continuous miniaturization of the components, passive and active two-phase cooling devices can now be applied to electronics systems while maintaining the fundamental compactness and lightness of the whole system. This paper presents the experimental assessment of an electronic cooling prototype especially designed for helicopter avionics thermal management in the framework of 7 th FP EU project TOICA (Thermal Overall Integrated Conception of Aircraft, www. toica-fp 7. eu). The prototype consists of a set of compact Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) especially designed for the hot spot treatment at blade level and an air cooled mini-Vapor Cycle System (mini-VCS), which is devoted to the overall heat rejection. One innovative concept of this system design lies {{in the presence of a}} thermal connector, named thermal plug, which acts as the evaporator of the mini-VCS, that cools down the LHP condenser. The experimental results are carried out at different hot spot heat loads, from 10 W to 50 W. The effect of different heat sink temperatures on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. Furthermore, for a fixed evaporating temperature of the mini-VCS, the effects of vapor superheating at the <b>outlet</b> of the <b>plug</b> evaporator on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. The proposed preliminary results allow to exploit the potentiality to use the proposed cooling technology in a typical airborne scenario...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{effectiveness}} of soil management practices on surface and subsurface water quality {{at the field}} scale is becoming increasingly important in the Lake Champlain Basin and other agricultural watersheds. During 2012 and 2013, field plots (22. 9 x 45. 7 m) were established at the Lake Alice Wildlife Area in Chazy, NY to begin a long-term water quality monitoring study. Plots were established in a cool season grass field (1 ha) leased and managed by the William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy, NY. The soil type transitions from an excessively drained outwash soil on the upslope to a very poorly drained silty clay series at the toeslope. Tile drainage lines were installed in each plot and drained to concrete manholes {{at the corner of}} each plot where water was sampled and measured. Plots were randomly assigned to a tile-drained (TD) or naturally-drained treatment (UD). Tile <b>outlets</b> were <b>plugged</b> in the UD treatment to enable natural drainage conditions. Surface runoff water was collected at the lower boundary of each plot by shallow PVC-lined trenches that outlet to the manholes. Continuous water flow from each hydrologic pathway was measured in 5 -gallon buckets with v-notch weirs and pressure transducers. Total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus SRP), unreactive phosphorus (UP) and sediment (TSS) loads were estimated by multiplying the mean hourly runoff volume by the respective sample concentration for each hydrologic pathway. Data were collected April 21, 2014 through June 30, 2015. Loading rates were unable to be calculated from February 22, 2015 through April 9, 2015 due to freeze/thaw cycles preventing accurate water flow data collection. Event-based loading for TP, SRP, UP, TSS, and water yield were calculated in addition to cumulative losses over the study duration. No significant differences in cumulative TP exports were found between treatments (UD = 230. 9 g ha- 1; TD = 233. 9 g ha- 1). Approximately 55 % more SRP and 158 % more TSS was exported by UD (130. 8 g ha- 1; 168. 8 kg ha- 1) than TD (84. 2 g ha- 1; 65. 5 kg ha- 1). Unreactive P exports from TD (149. 7 g ha- 1) were 50 % greater than UD (100. 1 g ha- 1). Two runoff events dominated the treatment response. An intense rain storm on May 16, 2014 generated the greatest sediment losses in both treatments during an individual event, contributing 65 and 67 % of the cumulative losses from TD and UD, respectively. This event was also responsible for 40 % of UP losses from TD. A 3 d rain/snowmelt event beginning on December 24, 2014 resulted in 61 and 84 % of all SRP losses for TD and UD, respectively. The results {{of this study indicate that}} tile drainage may not have a negative impact on water quality relative to a naturally drained field. However, additional years of data are needed to develop more robust conclusions as different management strategies and weather conditions could result in different outcomes...|$|R

The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines.

Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column).
