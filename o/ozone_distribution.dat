40|$|International audienceAn ozone {{climatology}} {{based on}} ozonesonde measurements {{taken over the}} last 17 yr has been constructed for model evaluation and comparisons to other observations. Vertical ozone profiles for 42 stations around the globe have been compiled for the period 1995 - 2011, in pressure and tropopause-referenced altitudes. For each profile, the mean, standard deviation, median, the half-width are provided, {{as well as information}} about interannual variability. Regional aggregates are formed in combining stations with similar ozone characteristics. The Hellinger distance is introduced as a new diagnostic to identify stations that describe similar shapes of <b>ozone</b> probability <b>distribution</b> functions (PDFs). In this way, 12 regions were selected covering at least 2 stations and the variability among those stations is discussed. Significant variability with longitude of <b>ozone</b> <b>distributions</b> in the troposphere and lower stratosphere in the northern mid- and high latitudes is found. The representativeness of regional aggregates is discussed for high northern latitudes, Western Europe, Eastern US, and Japan, using independent observations from surface stations and MOZAIC aircraft data. Good agreement exists between ozonesondes and aircraft observations in the mid-troposphere and between ozonesondes and surface observations for Western Europe. For Eastern US and high northern latitudes, surface ozone values from ozonesondes are biased 10 ppb high compared to independent measurements. An application of the climatology is presented using the NCAR CAM-Chem model.

SOLSE is intended to perform <b>ozone</b> <b>distribution</b> that a nadir instrument can achieve. This will be performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized Door Assembly (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region 20 km to 50 km altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.|$|E

In comparison to observations from the PICO-NARE observatory in the Azores, ozonesondes across Canada, and the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI) satellite instruments, the model <b>ozone</b> <b>distribution</b> is shown to be in reasonable agreement with mean biases less than 10 ppbv. We use the adjoint of GEOS-Chem to show the model <b>ozone</b> <b>distribution</b> in the free troposphere over Maritime Canada is largely sensitive to NOx emissions from biomass burning sources in Central Canada, lightning sources in the central US, and anthropogenic sources in eastern US and south-eastern Canada. We also use the adjoint of GEOS-Chem to evaluate the Fire Locating And Monitoring of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) inventory through assimilation of CO observations from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument. The CO inversion showed that, on average the FLAMBE emissions needed to be reduced to 89 % of their original values, with scaling factors ranging from 12 % to 102 %, to fit the MOPITT observations in the boreal regions. Applying the CO scaling factors to all species emitted from boreal biomass burning sources led to a decrease of the model tropospheric distributions of CO, PAN, and NOx by as much as − 20 ppbv, − 50 ppbv, and − 20 ppbv respectively. The impact of optimizing the biomass burning emissions was to reduce the model <b>ozone</b> <b>distribution</b> by approximately − 3 ppbv (− 8 %) and on average improved the agreement of the model <b>ozone</b> <b>distribution</b> compared to the observations throughout the free troposphere reducing the mean model bias from 5. 5 to 4. 0 ppbv for the PICO-NARE observatory, 3. 0 to 0. 9 ppbv for ozonesondes, 2. 0 to 0. 9 ppbv for TES, and 2. 8 to 1. 4 ppbv for IASI...|$|E
