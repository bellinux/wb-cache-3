5|$|Though the {{original}} release of God of War III {{was met with}} critical acclaim, God of War III Remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Sony decided to remaster God of War III for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of God of War II, which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise {{was given to the}} smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because {{the original}} already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.|$|E
25|$|In the Lois Duncan novel Locked in Time {{the main}} protagonist Nora finds it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> her 13 year old stepsister Josie commented {{how she was}} almost trampled to death at the Ringling Circus Fire, even though the event had {{occurred}} many years before Josie was born.|$|E
25|$|Commentators who {{characterize}} the Muslim reaction as hypocritical claim to several inconsistencies. First, the numerous anti-Semitic publications in Arab media. One website, Filibuster Cartoons, pointed out this criticism {{in a political}} cartoon. Also countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Libya where demonstrations are tightly controlled, {{have been accused of}} allowing violent riots as a distraction. In the case of Syria, protests would not be inconvenient in light of the current Hariri investigation. Furthermore, they believe it is <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> cartoons are considered blasphemous when terrorist attacks in the name of Islam are not equally condemned by Muslims.|$|E

25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> a man {{who appeared to be}} a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found {{it hard to believe that}} a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Andreotti, who he had never spoken to, would suddenly contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E
25|$|The name Ám {{agrees with}} that of a son of Dag in the Ættartolur and Jöfurmar is {{probably}} identical with Jöfur of the Ættartolur. Fradmar, Gyrd, Álf the Old, and the two Frekis bring the total to seven. Adding the names Óli and Arngrím to this list from the Ættartolur brings the tally to nine, as the Ættartolur promised. This may be coincidental. It is <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> the Hyndluljód here leaves out the only two names for which the Hversu provides descendants. It is possible that the following stanzas of the Hyndluljód down to stanza24 cover otherwise unknown members of the Dögling lineage since stanza23 at least returns to the Dödlings, providing the names of the twelve sons of Arngrím and the following stanza tells of their birth to Arngrím and Eyfura. Áli mentioned in stanza14 of the Hyndluljód (quoted near the beginning of this article) may be identical to Óli son of Dag mentioned in the Ættartolur.|$|E

500|$|A {{huge amount}} of press {{publicity}} ensued, with all the major newspapers and press organisations reporting that Whiteread had won both awards. Media reaction to the K Foundation award was mixed. David Mills wrote in The Times that The K Foundation's campaign was [...] "tiresome", and he asked [...] "Doesn't it strike anyone as <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> {{a group of people}} who made their money with such artistic endeavours as a disco-version of the Dr Who theme should be suggesting that contemporary art was somehow more fatuous than that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Felix Schoonen of Vampire Magazine {{said it was}} <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> {{the album}} was self-released by the band, asking, [...] "why should a band like Devourment release their own album... every week countless useless {{releases}} are thrown on the market by bands that nobody will ever care for and Devourment is somehow forced to release its own album." [...] In 2006, the band signed a two-album deal with label Brutal Bands, and proceeded to re-record and re-release Butcher the Weak. The new release's cover was yellow, while the self-released version sported a green cover, though they bore the same design.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, {{it made me feel}} a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit <b>odd,</b> <b>that</b> period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} strongly positive {{responses from}} critics, {{and it was}} frequently cited as {{the highlight of the}} album. Phil Sutcliffe in Sounds magazine said the song was [...] "so honest you might even risk calling it truth". Music website AllMusic called [...] "Biko" [...] a [...] "stunning achievement for its time", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> such a bleak song can sound so freeing and liberating". Writing in 2013, Mark Pedelty would say that [...] "Biko" [...] "stood out for its unusual instrumentation (bagpipes and synthesizer), haunting vocals, and funerary chant," [...] and credited Gabriel with doing a [...] "masterful job of creating catalytic imagery and getting out of the way". Music scholar Michael Drewett wrote that the lyrics skillfully engaged the listener by moving from a specific story to a call for action.|$|E
500|$|In May 2000, he was rehired {{and brought}} back into the role with a multi-year contract. The return story scripted for the Dimitri {{character}} centered on the romance between his brother Edmund and his wife Alex. Dimitri was revealed to be alive just as his wife, Alex, and brother, Edmund, had sex for the first time. Nader {{said he wanted to}} create a deeper layer in the character instead of focusing solely on the love triangle between Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund. [...] "I do hope to pursue some sort of subtle spiritual change, some perception that Dimitri is different," [...] he said. He questioned the writers' storyline choice in not exploring the popular Dimitri and Erica romance again. [...] "I found it sort of <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> they'd move me so far away from Susan," [...] Nader said. [...] "They're trying to explore these other themes." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends {{wrote that}} the {{collection}} [...] "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available", and that for fans of the series, [...] "this collection is not for you" [...] as all games (with the exception of God of War III) are available for download, and it will [...] "likely be redundant." [...] However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that it was <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> the PSP games were included as downloads, {{and would like to}} have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a 4 out of 5 and called it [...] "an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood-drenched action–especially newcomers who get five titles for the price of one", but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection.|$|E

500|$|As {{the wife}} of Den Watts, one of British soap's biggest figures, Chrissie was a {{high-profile}} character, with the turns in her storylines regularly splashed across the tabloid papers. According to Steve Hendry of the Daily Mail (Glasgow), Oberman was an [...] "overnight success" [...] {{in the role of}} Chrissie, and successfully [...] "exorcised the iconic ghost of long-dead Queen Vic lush Angie Watts", becoming, in the words of reporter Katherine Hassell, [...] "a national TV heroine after she arrived in Albert Square in 2004 as {{the wife of}} the resurrected Dirty Den". The character's tough and steely persona was widely cited by TV critics, such as Imogen Ridgway of The Evening Standard, who felt Chrissie to be the [...] "dominant female character" [...] in the show, maintaining an increasingly threatened EastEnders tradition of the independent, forceful female figure: [...] "For a soap originally underpinned by dominant female characters, it seems <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Chrissie Watts is apparently the only strong woman left in Walford".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] on The MDNA Tour in 2012. The {{performance of}} the song closed the show's first segment known as Transgression, and found Madonna playing the guitar while Minaj appeared on the backdrops sitting on a throne singing her verse. Saeed Saeed of The National praised Madonna for [...] "re-emerging once again triumphant in rock star mode," [...] during the performance Kat Keogh of Birmingham Mail described that [...] "The crowd was awash with a sea of camera phones as Madge grabbed a guitar for Nicki Minaj duet 'I Don’t Give A'." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times was mixed in his review, writing that Madonna [...] "still looks silly when, as she did in 'I Don’t Give A', she slings an electric guitar and makes rocker-chick faces" [...] and found it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> [...] "someone so physically disciplined can’t fake better guitar moves." [...] The performance was included on Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Bill Panzer {{said that}} Tessa became {{popular with the}} program's audience. Rob Lineberger called Tessa [...] "...beautiful and spirited," [...] and said that [...] "...she is the perfect mortal foil for MacLeod's heavy concerns. She lightens and {{strengthens}} him." [...] Reviewer Abbie Bernstein of the Audio Video Revolution website wrote that Tessa was [...] "...depicted not as a screechy, in-the-dark Lois Lane {{but rather as a}} woman who handles her lover’s supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism." [...] Berstein added that Tessa was [...] "estimable" [...] and [...] "...an unusually gutsy love interest (not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine, as opposed to the coy 'sexual tension'-generating females who usually populate the genre)." [...] Other reviewers had a more negative opinion. Reviewer Gord Lacey of TVShowsOnDVD.com [...] "...found it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> everyone liked Tessa because [...] found her rather annoying." [...] Reviewer Doug Anderson of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Tessa was [...] "...too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero's vengeance." ...|$|E

500|$|ANN {{noted that}} the second anime season tends to overdramatize, {{especially}} {{in the last three}} episodes. ANN also describes the second season as [...] "more embarrassing and shoujo-ai oriented" [...] than the first season, but that the solid characterization is still a strength of the series. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime appreciated the focus on characters other than Yumi and Sachiko for the second season, regarding Shimako's loss of Sei and befriending Noriko as being [...] "one of the more moving" [...] arcs of Printemps. ANN regarded the OVA season as the best of the first three seasons, citing the improved production standards and the less melodramatic storylines. ANN notes that the fourth season is [...] "a return to dramatic form" [...] after the relaxation of the OVA series, but it is not as melodramatic as the second season, due to the increased maturity of the cast. [...] Chris Beveridge, writing for Mania.com, found it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Yumi and Sachiko did not spend so much time together in the fourth season, and felt that the series needed an epilogue, but enjoyed seeing Yumi taking on some [...] "adult responsibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, {{appears in}} several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech {{at the end of}} the nunnery scene: [...] "Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state" [...] and [...] "And I, of ladies most deject and wretched". Many {{scholars}} have found it <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he [...] "showed how a character's language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, [...] "get thee to a nunnery", which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.|$|E
500|$|Leading pro-establishment figures {{cast doubt}} on the mainland's {{supposed}} role in the disappearances: Ip Kwok-him said {{that it was possible to}} use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, Yiu Si-wing disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; Michael Tien said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; Wong Kwok-kin said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports. Regina Ip said it was <b>odd</b> <b>that</b> Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong. Ng Leung-sing, during a Legislative Council discussion, claimed to have received a tip from [...] "an old friend" [...] that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island (...) , an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes. The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as character assassination, were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item. Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name. Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.|$|E
