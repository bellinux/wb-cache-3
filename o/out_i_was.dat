25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
500|$|Morrison has said, [...] "When Astral Weeks came <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> starving, literally." [...] Released in 1968, {{the album}} {{eventually}} achieved critical acclaim, but it originally received an indifferent {{response from the}} public. It was described by AllMusic's William Ruhlmann as hypnotic, meditative, and as possessing a unique musical power. It {{has been compared to}} French Impressionism and mystical Celtic poetry.|$|E

500|$|Comedian Russell Brand guest starred as himself. He told The Sun that, [...] "I {{was having}} an amazing {{birthday}} party and found <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going into space. Then my agent says, 'Oh, The Simpsons want you in an episode.' Once you've gone yellow, you've made it. My ideal show would be where I have a cartoon relapse with Barney and Homer and get smashed {{out of my mind}} with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of Grossman's {{hostility to}} Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson. Wilson recalled: [...] "I didn't even {{particularly}} like folk music. I'd been recording Sun Ra and Coltrane ... I thought folk music {{was for the}} dumb guys. [...] played like the dumb guys, but then these words came <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> flabbergasted." [...] At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Talkin' World War III Blues", [...] "Bob Dylan's Dream", and [...] "Walls of Red Wing". [...] "Walls of Red Wing" [...] was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.|$|E
500|$|Michele bases Rachel {{on herself}} {{when she was}} younger, and also draws {{inspiration}} from the film Election, and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester). She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't matter anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things <b>out</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. Records premiered {{the final}} mix of [...] "Ghost" [...] for {{streaming}} on December 10, 2013, {{and the song}} became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a [...] "demented dance-floor delight." [...] A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to [...] "make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday {{is just a little}} bit closer than it should be." [...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they found <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?

500|$|TV Overmind Carissa Pavlica {{commented on}} Tom Pelphrey guest role saying [...] "I adored Guiding Light and {{considering}} the roles Tom Pelphrey (my beloved Jonathan from GL) gets after his run as the bad-boy, I immediately suspected {{he would be}} the killer. Turned <b>out</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong, but he was still a class A jerk". Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up so fast and furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell you. She added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know. Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E

2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms.

2500|$|The {{production}} of the single cost Spector around $35,000, then a considerable amount. Spector himself was deeply concerned about the reception to a song that was unusual for its time, worrying that his vision would not be understood. He canvassed a few opinions - his publisher Don Kirshner suggested that the song should be re-titled [...] "Bring Back That Lovin' Feelin'", while New York DJ Murray the K thought that bass line in the middle section {{similar to that of}} a slowed-down [...] "La Bamba" [...] should be the start of the song. [...] Spector took these as criticisms and later said: [...] "I didn't sleep for a week when that record came <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so sick, I got a spastic colon; I had an ulcer." ...|$|E
