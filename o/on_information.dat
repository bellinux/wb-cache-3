5|$|The National Register of Electors is updated {{to reflect}} various {{changes in the}} Canadian population, {{including}} address changes, reaching voting age, naturalisation, and death. Every year, about 3,000,000 address changes are processed by Elections Canada from information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, Canada Post, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Every year, about 400,000 Canadians reach voting age and 200,000 Canadians die, resulting in changes to the National Register of Electors based <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Additionally, 120,000 individuals a year become naturalised Canadians, and {{are added to the}} National Register of Electors by Elections Canada based <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

5|$|By {{capturing}} Glina, the HV trapped {{the bulk}} of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojnić, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and non-commissioned officers with side arms to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as defined in the National Geographic Database. That data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based <b>on</b> <b>information</b> received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely <b>on</b> <b>information</b> gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). Other instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E
5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely <b>on</b> <b>information</b> gained from economics.
