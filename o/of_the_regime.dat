5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E

5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths {{and the concept of}} blood and soil. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E

5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything {{in his power to}} make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or other aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was very}} fond of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close {{relationship}} with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends.

5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order.

5|$|The Nazi party's {{goal was}} to remove Jews from German {{cultural}} and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions. Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin {{in the early years}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E

5000|$|Papadopoulos' regime imposed martial law. The {{press was}} {{subjected}} to harsh censorship. Thousands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime's</b> political opponents were thrown into prison or exiled ("forced into vacation", as <b>the</b> friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> junta cynically put it) on small Aegean islands. Amnesty International issued a report detailing numerous instances <b>of</b> torture under <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> Papadopoulos excused these actions as necessary to save the nation from a [...] "Communist takeover." [...] <b>The</b> <b>regime</b> {{was supported by the}} United States because of its staunchly anti-Communist stance.|$|R
5000|$|Rajavi's {{assassination}} required enormous resources, extensive planning, {{and coordination}} among several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime's</b> organizations. After extensive investigations, Roland Chatelain, the Swiss magistrate in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, and Swiss judicial and police officials confirmed <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> Iran's government under Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> thirteen official agents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iranian <b>regime</b> {{who had used}} [...] "service passports" [...] to enter Switzerland for their plot.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1934, top {{officials}} of the SA and opponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels {{was present at the}} arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor).|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E

3000|$|A {{dynamical}} behaviour {{of molecules}} encapsulated inside nanotubes can {{correspond to the}} following regimes: oscillations about a fixed position and/or a fixed orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule (<b>regime</b> A), hindered motion along the nanotube axis and/or rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule (<b>regime</b> B) and free motion and/or rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule (<b>regime</b> C).

5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as the brains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July 1944, a {{group of}} German army {{officers}} led by Claus von Stauffenberg and {{including some of the}} highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so. The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people. Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E
