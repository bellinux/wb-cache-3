5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set aside for a series <b>of</b> <b>funny,</b> colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street. These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|We write jokes, and {{the jokes}} are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

25|$|Walter Reade Jr.'s company Continental Distributors {{purchased}} the U.S rights of War and Peace for $1.5 million.

Its premiere {{was held in the}} DeMille Theater, New York, on 28 April 1968, and attended by actresses Ludmila Savelyeva and Irina Skobtseva, as well as ambassadors Anatoly Dobrynin and Yakov Malik.

On 23 January 1969, Kresel's edition opened in London's Curzun cinema.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{cells are}} exposed to {{different}} environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When myocardial cell {{are exposed to}} hyperkaliemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized {{as a result of}} the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> current even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.|$|E
50|$|The main use <b>of</b> <b>funnies</b> {{is to add}} {{interest}} to informal matchplay games as they enable players to win something regardless of the overall outcome of the match. They are frequently associated with gambling, with money, usually small stakes, changing hands depending on which funnies occur.|$|R

500|$|This is {{the only}} episode {{that does not have}} [...] "the" [...] in the title. A {{decision}} was made to name all the episodes in this way so that the writers would not waste time trying to think <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> titles and instead make the content of the episode funny. However, this decision was made after the script for [...] "Male Unbonding" [...] was completed.

500|$|In 1972, Justin Green asked Spiegelman to do a three-page strip for {{the first}} issue <b>of</b> <b>Funny</b> [...] [...] He wanted to do one about racism, and at first {{considered}} a story with African-Americans as mice and cats taking {{on the role of}} the Ku Klux Klan. [...] Instead, he turned to the Holocaust that his parents had survived. [...] He titled the strip [...] "Maus" [...] and depicted the Jews as mice persecuted by die Katzen, which were Nazis as cats. [...] The narrator related the story to a mouse named [...] "Mickey". [...] With this story Spiegelman felt he had found his voice.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received.

Doug Perry of IGN commended the [...] "sharp looking" [...] environments as [...] "clean and fully formed" [...] and the characters are [...] "full <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> animations and cleanly designed". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot said that the environments [...] "are reasonably large, and they convey the cartoon-like attitude {{of the game}} very nicely."

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like {{that they have a}} message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing. Even I found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E

500|$|Charles Bramesco of The A.V. Club {{recommended}} the film, writing that [...] "The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity. It’s {{hard not to}} respect", and noted the film's [...] "enduring appeal". Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances [...] "a little rough", and wrote [...] "If Killer Klowns isn't especially scary, it's only kind <b>of</b> <b>funny</b> but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif". Dread Central gave the film three {{out of a possible}} five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film [...] "is the KING of 80's B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads".
