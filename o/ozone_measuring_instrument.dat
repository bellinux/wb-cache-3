The second generation is for the <b>Ozone</b> <b>Measuring</b> <b>Instrument</b> flying on the EOS Aura spacecraft launched in 2004. We are now developing a third generation of the system for evaluation science data processing for the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) to be flown by the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) in 2006. The initial system was based on large scale proprietary hardware, operating and database systems. The current OMI system and the OMPS system being developed are based on commodity hardware, the LINUX Operating System and on PostgreSQL, an Open Source RDBMS. The new system distributes its data archive across multiple server hosts and processes jobs on multiple processor boxes. We have created several instances of this system, including one for operational processing, one for testing and reprocessing and one for applications development and scientific analysis. Prior to receiving the first data from OMI we applied the system to reprocessing information from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments flown from 1978 until now. The system was able to process 25 years (108, 000 orbits) of data and produce 800, 000 files (400 GiB) of level 2 and level 3 products {{in less than a}} week.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ozone layer}} is under threat due to warming in the {{troposphere}} {{brought about by}} the increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations. Warming in the troposphere makes the stratosphere cooler, producing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) that support chemical reactions that produce active chlorine which destroys ozone. Ozone measurements and analyses with different instrument platforms (satellite-borne and ground-based) must still be performed as they remain essential even with the signing of the Montréal Protocol. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) contributes to the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) Program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) [2006 - 2013] by <b>measuring</b> daily total <b>ozone</b> column using a Dobson spectrophotometer. Maximum amount of ozone was observed during the northern hemisphere summer period and minimum throughout the northern hemisphere winter due to unequal solar radiation which is a factor for ozone production. The differences between satellite-borne and ground-based <b>ozone</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> were investigated and it was found out that the measurements vary due to local weather events, solar zenith angle, sky conditions, and the relatively large footprint of the satellites. Comparing the ground-based Dobson spectrophotometer and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument on-board the ENVISAT satellite yielded a correlation coefficient and a root-mean-squar...|$|R
40|$|The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has been}} {{monitoring}} {{the ozone layer}} from space using optical remote sensing techniques since 1970. With concern over catalytic destruction of ozone (mid- 1970 s) {{and the development of}} the Antarctic ozone hole (mid- 1980 s), long term ozone monitoring has become the primary focus of NASA's series of <b>ozone</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments.</b> A series of TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) and SBUV (Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet) instruments has produced a nearly continuous record of global ozone from 1979 to the present. These <b>instruments</b> infer <b>ozone</b> by <b>measuring</b> sunlight backscattered from the atmosphere in the ultraviolet through differential absorption. These measurements have documented a 15 Dobson Unit drop in global average ozone since 1980, and the declines in ozone in the antarctic each October have been far more dramatic. <b>Instruments</b> that <b>measure</b> the <b>ozone</b> vertical distribution, the SBUV and SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) instruments for example, show that the largest changes are occurring in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. The goal of ozone measurement in the next decades will be to document the predicted recovery of the ozone layer as CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) levels decline. This will require a continuation of global measurements of total column ozone on a global basis, but using data from successor instruments to TOMS. Hyperspectral <b>instruments</b> capable of <b>measuring</b> in the UV will be needed for this purpose.

40|$|In {{order to}} exploit the full-earth viewing {{potential}} of satellite instruments to globally characterise aerosols, new algorithms are required to deduce key microphysical parameters like the particle size distribution and optical parameters associated with scattering and absorption from space remote sensing data. Here, a methodology based on neural networks is developed to retrieve such parameters from satellite inputs and to validate them with ground-based remote sensing data. For key combinations of input variables available from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the <b>Ozone</b> <b>Measuring</b> <b>Instrument</b> (OMI) Level 3 data sets, a grid of 100 feed-forward neural network architectures is produced, each having a different number of neurons and training proportion. The networks are trained with principal components accounting for 98 % of the variance of the inputs together with principal components formed from 38 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Level 2. 0 (Version 2) retrieved parameters as outputs. Daily averaged, co-located and synchronous data drawn from a cluster of AERONET sites centred on the peak of dust extinction in Northern Africa is used for network training and validation, and the optimal network architecture for each input parameter combination is identified {{with reference to the}} lowest mean squared error. The trained networks are then fed with unseen data at the coastal dust site Dakar to test their simulation performance. A neural network (NN), trained with co-located and synchronous satellite inputs comprising three aerosol optical depth measurements at 470, 550 and 660 nm, plus the columnar water vapour (from MODIS) and the modelled absorption aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (from OMI), was able to simultaneously retrieve the daily averaged size distribution, the coarse mode volume, the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, and the spectral single scattering albedo – with moderate precision: correlation coefficients in the range 0. 368 ≤ R ≤ 0. 514. The network failed to recover the spectral behaviour of the real part of the complex refractive index. This new methodological approach appears to offer some potential for moderately accurate daily retrieval of the total volume concentration of the coarse mode of aerosol at the Saharan dust peak in the area of Northern Africa...|$|E
