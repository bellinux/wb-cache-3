5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ADS</b> or armoured suit, which isolates the diver {{from the pressure}} at depth, {{at the cost of}} mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} hype related to {{commercials}} {{in the months}} leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like YouTube. Frito-Lay announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their Doritos brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their Chevrolet brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} in atmospheric pressure suits stagnated in the 1940s through 1960s, as efforts were concentrated on solving {{the problems of}} deep diving by dealing with the physiological problems of ambient pressure diving instead of avoiding them by isolating the diver from the pressure.

Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population.

MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a dialogue about the issue. This emphasis on morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading {{to an increase in}} unsafe abortions in India.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Blackwell Co {{was among}} the first to {{implement}} a large-scale outdoor advertising campaign around the country. The company partnered with the New York Sign Company and hired skilled ad painter, Jule Gilmer Körner, or “Rueben Rink,” builder of the landmark home Korner's Folly, as head of advertising. These ads started in the late 1870s and consisted of giant depictions of the bull with catchy sayings or a depiction of the price. Rink hired 4 teams of painters to go around the states and constantly paint ads. These signs were placed on huge billboards along major roads and rails, on the side of various buildings, and any other place that would be regularly seen. This was done in hopes that spreading the name of the product and the continuity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> would increase sales.|$|E

500|$|The Whopper {{has been}} at the center of several hoaxes and pranks from the company. In a 1998 April Fool's Day prank, Burger King took out a full page {{advertisement}} in several national publications such as USA Today advertising a new version of the sandwich called the [...] "Left-Handed Whopper". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws. Another prank from 2013 claimed that the company was introducing a [...] "hands-free Whopper holder" [...] to allow people to eat the sandwich while doing other activities. The unit, similar to a harmonica holder, was supposed to be introduced in Puerto Rico to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. It was later revealed to be a joke. A 2007 advertising campaign celebrating the golden anniversary of the Whopper showed real customers in Las Vegas reacting to the false news the Whopper has been discontinued. While it was not permanently discontinued, the ad claims it was discontinued for one day. Later versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ads</b> had customers receiving a Big Mac or Wendy's Single and their reactions to the sandwich.
