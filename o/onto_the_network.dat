30|$|In this paper, we {{take the}} first step in the {{direction}} of a multiple layer approach by performing a combined analysis of <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> obtained from SMSs, voice phone calls, and spatial proximity at a metropolitan scale.

Data have been structured like a network of three networks [15] and formally described by a directed multigraph. By computing a set of complex network metrics, at different scales, <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> three single <b>networks</b> and their extensions <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> multiplex <b>network</b> [16], we contribute to some findings on human behavior in the different dimensions captured by mobile phone data.|$|R
