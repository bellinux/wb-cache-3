The buoyancy frequency N {{is used to}} make the time dimensionless, "t*.

40|$|An annual-mean surface-forced {{component}} of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) in density space, surf(,?), is diagnosed from observed surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The climatological mean of surf over 1980 – 97 indicates steady <b>overturning</b> rates for those water masses that are principally formed through surface buoyancy forcing: 8 Sv of Greenland Sea Deep Water (GSDW), 4 Sv of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), and 4 Sv of 18 ° Water (STMW). Obtained for each year over 1980 – 97, surf reveals interannual-to-decadal variability in the renewal and <b>overturning</b> of these water masses. The total surface-forced <b>overturning</b> rate varies in the range 10 – 20 Sv, reaching peak values in 1989 – 90 and generally decreasing over the period 1990 – 97. More dramatic changes are apparent in the <b>overturning</b> of different water masses. The <b>overturning</b> of STMW exhibits large-amplitude interannual variability. A background positive trend over 1980 – 97 is dominated by variance of 13. 4 Sv. By contrast, the <b>overturning</b> rates of LSW and GSDW vary more slowly, on decadal timescales. LSW <b>overturning</b> rates increase from near zero in the early 1980 s {{to a maximum of}} 10 Sv in 1990 and return to near zero by 1997. Seemingly in antiphase, GSDW <b>overturning</b> rates decline from a peak rate of 11 Sv in 1981 to a minimum of 3. 5 Sv in 1991, and then increase somewhat up to 1997. The variability in these <b>overturning</b> rates is related to changes in the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic oscillation (AO) over 1980 – 97. Correlation coefficients between total <b>overturning</b> rate and three versions of the NAO index are significantly positive at a 99 % confidence level. Also highly significant is a correlation of LSW <b>overturning</b> and the AO index, and an anticorrelation between <b>overturning</b> of LSW and GSDW. The <b>overturning</b> of STMW is more weakly (and not significantly) anticorrelated with NAO indices, although there is highly significant anticorrelation between interannual changes in STMW <b>overturning</b> and one version of the NAO index. Stronger LSW (GSDW) <b>overturning</b> in years when NAO indices are relatively high (low) is consistent with recent hydrographic evidence. The extent to which these relationships support a hypothesis that the NAO drives interannual-to-decadal variability in the THC, through wintertime atmospheric buoyancy forcing of the ocean, is discussed. <br/...|$|R

Emphasis {{is placed on}} possible measures {{that can be taken}} to prevent <b>overturning</b> of lorries. In Europe, <b>overturning</b> occurs in 3 % to 10 % of all accidents involving lorries. In the United States, <b>overturning</b> occurs in 4 % to 9 % of all accidents involving lorries, in one third of single vehicle accidents with lorries, and in 15 % of the fatal accidents with lorries.

40|$|Understanding {{changes in}} ocean {{circulation}} {{during the last}} deglaciation is crucial to unraveling the dynamics of glacial-interglacial and millennial climate shifts. We used neodymium isotope measurements on postdepositional iron-manganese oxide coatings precipitated on planktonic foraminifera to reconstruct changes in the bottom water source of the deep western North Atlantic at the Bermuda Rise. Comparison of our deep water source record with <b>overturning</b> strength proxies shows that both the deep water mass source and the <b>overturning</b> rate shifted rapidly and synchronously during the last deglacial transition. In contrast, any freshwater perturbation caused by Heinrich event 1 could have only affected shallow <b>overturning.</b> These findings show how changes in upper-ocean <b>overturning</b> associated with millennial-scale events differ from those associated with whole-ocean deglacial climate events. Changes in ocean <b>overturning</b> affect re-gional climate through the redistributionof heat energy to the high latitudes (1).

Proxy reconstructions, based on sedimentary Pa- 231 /Th- 230 ratios and the difference between surface-and deep-water radiocarbon ages, indicate that during the last glacial period, the <b>overturning</b> circulation was reduced during millennial-scale periods of cooling(1 - 5).

40|$|This study {{describes}} chores when {{farmers were}} either fatally or seriously injured and required {{emergency medical treatment}} {{as a result of}} <b>overturns</b> of tractors with or without rollover protective structures (ROPS). Data from the 2002 Kentucky Farm Tractor <b>Overturn</b> Survey were used for this study. The data were collected by a telephone survey of a population-based random sample of 6063 (7. 98 %) of Kentucky’s 76, 017 farm operators as listed in the Kentucky Agricultural Statistics Service database. Of farm operators interviewed, 551 (9. 1 %) reported 603 <b>overturns</b> and 5512 (90. 9 %) reported no <b>overturns</b> in the history of their farm, covering a period from 1925 to February 2002. Only the latest <b>overturn</b> was considered to improve recall accuracy. In addition, since the 1925 to 1959 time period had only 49 (8. 1 %) of the <b>overturns</b> reported, (14 farmers did not provide the year of most recent overturn); only data from the 1960 to 2002 period (approximately 41 years) were used. After making these adjustments, incidents evaluated included 25 cases (one fatal and four serious nonfatal injuries) that involved ROPS-equipped tractor <b>overturns</b> and 88 cases (24 fatal and 64 serious nonfatal injuries) that involved non-ROPS tractor <b>overturns.</b> Chores at highest risk for tractor <b>overturns</b> were identified for which educational and ROPS retrofit interventions could be emphasized.
