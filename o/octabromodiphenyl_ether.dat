40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are {{currently}} the largest market group of flame retardants. The five major BFRs are tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBP-A), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and three commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which {{are known as}} decabromodiphenyl ether (Deca-BDE), <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (Octa-BDE), and pentabromodiphenyl ether (Penta-BDE). PBDEs, HBCDs, HBCDs and TBBP-A are used {{in a variety of}} consumer products, including computers, electronics and electrical equipment, televisions, textiles, foam-padded furniture, insulating foams, and other building materials. Since their introduction about 20 years ago, BFRs are found everywhere in the environment, including in our food. Since the concentrations in food are very low, the chemical analysis of these chemicals is a challenging task with numerous pitfalls. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are widely}} used as flame retardants and have been detected in human blood, adipose tissue, and breast milk. Developmental and long-term exposures to these contaminants may pose a human health risk, especially to children. Previously, we demonstrated that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are neurotoxic and structurally similar to PBDEs, perturbed intracellular signaling events, including calcium homeostasis and subsequent events such as protein kinase C (PKC), which are critical for the normal function {{and development of the}} nervous system. The objective {{of the present study was}} to test whether commercial PBDE mixtures (DE- 71, a pentabrominated dipheyl ether mixture, and DE- 79, a mostly <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> mixture) affected intracellular signaling mechanisms in a similar way to that of PCBs and other organohalogens, as an attempt to understand the common mode of action for these persistent chemicals.

40|$|Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) {{is used as}} a flame {{retardant}} in a variety of products, including thermoset resin plastics, textiles, and adhesives. While decaBDE itself is not known to be highly toxic, it is capable of debrominating into other polybromominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners such as pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) or <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (octaBDE) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010, Environment Canada, 2010; Minnesota Pollution Control Agency [MPCA], 2008). These congeners can be more persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) than decaBDE (CDC, 2010; Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2009). Neither pentaBDE nor octaBDE have been produced in the United States since 2004, when the Great Lakes Chemical Corporation stopped production during a voluntary phase-out of the chemical (EPA, 2009). Although pentaBDE and octaBDE are no longer produced in the U. S, they continue {{to be found in the}} environment and in humans (Environment Canada, 2010; EPA, 2009; MPCA, 2008).

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} widely used as flame retardants in a number of applications. Three commercial PBDE mixtures have been produced and used in the United States and elsewhere: commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (c-pentaBDE), commercial <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (c-octaBDE), and commercial decabromodiphenyl ether (c-decaBDE). Although manufacture and import of c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE were phased out in 2004, PBDE congeners associated with those mixtures continue to be found in humans and the environment. Some reports indicate that levels are continuing to increase. Imported articles treated with c-pentaBDE and c-octaBDE could be a source of human and environmental exposure to these PBDE congeners. c-DecaBDE is still manufactured and used in the United States. Data suggest that debromination, physical or metabolic removal of bromine atoms, may convert decaBDE to more toxic PBDE congeners, contributing further to the potential risk from exposure to these congeners. EPA is concerned that some of the component congeners are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and intends to initiate a number of actions to limit the exposure and release of PBDE congeners and/or articles to which they have been added. These actions are to: (1) Initiat...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OctaBDE) {{was used}} as a flame {{retardant}} applied mostly in the manufacture of plastics utilized in the electrical and electronic industries. Owing to its long half-life and being regarded as an environmental pollutant, OctaBDE, like other polybrominated diphenyl ethers, has been classified as a persistent organic pollutant (POP). This study was carried out to assess the effects of oxidative stress (redox homeostasis) induced in rats by OctaBDE. Material and Methods: Female Wistar rats exposed intragastrically to OctaBDE at single (25, 200 or 2000 mg/kg b. w.), or repeated (0. 4, 2, 8, 40 or 200 mg/kg/day) doses during 7 – 28 days were used in the experiment. Selected oxidative stress parameters were determined in the liver and blood serum. Results: Administration (single or repeated) of OctaBDE to rats resulted in the impaired redox homeostasis, as evidenced by the increased levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the liver, the reduced total antioxidant status (TAS) in serum and the increased concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver. After multiple doses of OctaBDE, elevated activity of glutathione transferase (GST) in the liver was also noted. Conclusions: After repeated administration of OctaBDE at the lowest dose (0. 4 mg/kg/day), changes were observed in the parameters (MDA, TAS, GSSG) indicative of oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional system coupling ultra-performance {{liquid chromatography}} (UPLC) and ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) {{has been applied}} for the separation and analysis of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs). A complex mixture containing 23 OH-PBDE congeners ranging from hydroxylated monobromodiphenyl ether (OH-monoBDE) to hydroxylated <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OH-octaBDE) was satisfactorily separated within 16 min of analysis time. The first-dimensional reversed-phase UPLC was performed on a sub- 2 mu m BEH C(18) chromatographic column using acetonitrile-water gradient elution program with a flow rate ramp. It enabled excellent chromatographic separation for both between-class and within-class OH-PBDEs based on their differences in hydrophobicity. Following the pre-ionization resolution in the first dimension, the second-dimensional IM-MS employed a hybrid electrospray quadrupole ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and added an extra post-ionization separation for between-class OH-PBDE congeners on account of their relative mobility disparity during {{a very short period}} of 8. 80 ms. The orthogonality of the developed two-dimensional system was evaluated with the correlation coefficient of 0. 9665 and peak spreading angle of 14. 87 A degrees. The peak capacity of the system was calculated to be approximately 2 and 15 times higher than that of the two dimensions used alone, respectively. The two-dimensional separation plane also contributed to the removal of background interference ions and the enhanced confidence in the characterization of OH-PBDEs of interest...|$|E
40|$|The noncovalent {{interactions}} of 24 diversely structured hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PBDEs), ranging from hydroxylated monobromodiphenyl ether (OH-monoBDE) to hydroxylated <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OH-octaBDE), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{have been examined}} by employing an electrospray ionization source fitted on a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with a traveling wave ion mobility cell. The mass spectrometric parameters were finely optimized to favor the observation of noncovalent complexes. The experimental data confirm that due to the close structural resemblance with thyroid hormone thyroxine, some OH-PBDEs {{have been shown to}} conjugate with BSA. It is found that BSA preferentially interacts with one OH-octaBDE (4 '-OH-BDE- 201) and two hydroxylated heptabromodiphenyl ether (OH-heptaBDE) isomers (4 -OH-BDE- 187 and 6 -OH-BDE- 180) with 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 binding stoichiometries. The state of bound OH-PBDEs is inferred to be as both neutral and anionic species. The dissociation constants of corresponding noncovalent complexes are calculated by titration curve data fitting. Investigation into various OH-PBDE analogs demonstrates that both the degree of bromination and the positions of hydroxylation and bromine moieties may exert influence on the binding of OH-PBDEs to BSA. The possible conformational changes in BSA induced upon the binding of OH-PBDEs were explored by use of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to understand the details of the interactions in structural aspects.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{were the}} first brominated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) listed in the Stockholm Convention. Parties to the convention are currently establishing inventories for developing action plans for the environmentally sound management of PBDE-containing materials. The major use of commercial <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (c-OctaBDE) has been in casings from cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs and computer monitors. Large quantities of used e-waste and electronic equipment have been exported to developing countries with Nigeria being a major importer in Africa. The casings from 382 TVs and computers imported from major world regions to Nigeria were sampled in backyards and waste dumps. The samples were screened with X-ray flourescence (XRF) for bromine and analysed by gas chromatography/ electron capture detection (GC/ECD) for brominated flame retardants (BFRs). A high proportion of the CRT casings (61 %) contained more than 10, 000 ppm bromine from BFRs. Decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE) was the major flame retardant used in TV sets and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) for computer CRTs. The screening suggests that average PBDE levels (of c-OctaBDE[*]+[*]DecaBDE) in Nigerian-stockpiled CRT casings were 1. 1 % for TV and 0. 13 % for PC CRTs. These are above the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) limit and should be separated for RoHS compliant recycling. The Nigerian e-waste inventory of 237, 000 t of CRT plastic would therefore contain approx. 594 t c-OctaBDE and 1, 880 t of DecaBDE. In Nigeria, as for most developing countries, there is currently no adequate e-waste management, plastic separation or destruction capacity. The data highlight the urgent need to develop environmentally sound management for this large material flow...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are {{chemicals}} that {{are added to}} materials to inhibit or suppress ignition and are incorporated during the manufacture of e. g. electronic equipment, furniture, construction materials and textiles. BFRs have become an increasingly important group of organohalogen compounds, which include hexabromocyclododecane diastereomers (HBCDs), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) and commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PentaBDE, OctaBDE and DecaBDE) congeners. The use of BFRs has increased tremendously during the last decades mainly due to the high demand of petroleum-based polymeric materials which have to meet strict fire safety regulations to prevent possible accidents. There are five major classes of BFRs: tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), and three commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), or biphenyl oxides, which are known as pentabromodiphenyl ether (PentaBDE), <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OctaBDE) and decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE). However, OctaBDE and PentaBDE are not longer being produced or in use due to their ban in EU and voluntary withdrawal by the bromine industry in North America in 2004. The main purpose of this thesis is to assess the in vitro effects of brominated flame retardants and their metabolites on sex steroid hormone action. Sex steroid hormones, such as, estrogens or androgens are formed by steroidogenic enzymes in several endocrine glands. Two of the most relevant steroidogenic enzymes are the cytochrome P 450, CYP 17 and CYP 19 (also known as aromatase). Using the human adrenocortical carcinoma H 295 R cell line, the potential of BFRs (PBDEs, TBBPA and HBCD) {{and some of their}} metabolites (hydroxylated and methoxylated PBDEs) to alter aromatase activity was analyzed. Development and validation of an in vitro enzymatic technique to study the possible effects on CYP 17 activity by these compounds is included in the present thesis. In general, parent PBDEs did not significantly alter CYP 19 or CYP 17 activities, but pronounced inhibitory effects were found for their hydroxylated metabolites, although to some extend these effects were due to cytotoxicity. In order to differentiate between cytotoxic effects of these hydroxylated metabolites and actual catalytic inhibition of aromatase, a series of experiments with human placental microsomes were performed. All hydroxylated metabolites tested showed a significant inhibition of aromatase activity. Furthermore, the agonistic and antagonistic properties on the human androgen receptor (AR) by several BFRs and PBDE metabolites were studied in two different in vitro recombinant systems. No agonistic effects on the AR were detected by any of the tested compounds, although several of the BFRs and hydroxylated PBDEs exhibited anti-androgenic activity in both recombinant in vitro systems. Furthermore, two genomic techniques (microarray and qRT-PCR) were used to describe the changes in hepatic gene profiles in HBCD exposed rats. The results induced clear sex specific changes in the hepatic gene expression profiles, suggesting female rats to be more sensitive. The effects presented in this thesis are in good agreement with previous in vitro, as well as, in vivo studies and novel information about the mechanism of action of these BFRs and PBDE metabolites were elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} are {{a diverse group}} of chemicals, whose common points are that they all contain bromine and are all use to retard the {{combustibility}} of commercial goods. Two substances &# 8211; decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaDBE) and Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBP-A; this will be the subject of a separate Background Document) &# 8211; account for about 50 % of world use of brominated flame retardants. Two other polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PolyBDE) &# 8211; <b>octabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (OctaDBE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (PentaDBE) &# 8211; are used commercially, but in much smaller quantities than DecaBDE. Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) is also used in large volumes. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) have also been used, but production was stopped in September 2000. Some PolyBDE are toxic, especially those with smaller molecules. PentaDBE may disrupt the oestrogenic system. PBB have similar effects to polychlorinated biphenyls, and may also produce hypothyroidism. Some of these chemicals are bioaccumulated. Brominated flame retardants were given priority in the 1992 OSPAR Action Plan, and therefore included in 1998 in the List of Chemicals for Priority Action. The quantities of PolyBDE used in the EU in 1994 were estimated as: DecaBDE (8 210 tonnes) as a general-purpose flame retardant, especially in polymers, polypropylene fabric and other textiles (other than clothing fabrics); OctaBDE (2 550 tonnes) in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics (often used for casings of electrical and electronic equipment), nylon and other plastics and in adhesives and coatings; PentaBDE (125 tonnes) mainly in flexible polyurethane foam for furniture, as well as epoxy and phenolic resins, some polyesters and textiles. About 9 200 tonnes of HBCDD was used in the EU in 1999, 85 % of it in polystyrene. Since the products containing these chemicals are widely dispersed, their possible release from waste disposal routes may be of concern, together with their potential role in producing dioxins and furans during waste incineration. The degradation of DecaBDE to the more toxic and bioaccumulative lower levels of PolyBDE is also of concern. The overwhelming majority of samples of marine biota have not shown detectable quantities of DecaBDE; however, OctaBDE has been found in fish and molluscs (up to 325 &# 956;g/kg wet weight) and PentaBDE has been found in fish and marine mammals (up to 7 700 &# 956;g/kg in white-beaked dolphins). All these chemicals have been found in river or marine sediments. Action so far has been mainly through voluntary commitments by industry {{within the framework of the}} OECD. The risk assessment for PentaBDE under the EC existing substances regulation has concluded that risk reduction measures are needed. The PolyBDEs are proposed to be included as priority hazardous substances in the list of priority substances under the EC Water Framework Directive. The action recommended is: to support the inclusion of PBB in the draft EC Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment; to support early EC harmonised restrictions on PentaBDE; to await the completion of the EC risk assessment of OctaBDE, DecaBDE and HBCDD and seek appropriate risk-reduction strategies in the light of it; to support appropriate provision on PolyBDE in the draft EC Directives on Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment and on Restrictions on Certain Hazardous Substances in Electric and Electronic Equipment; to develop an OSPAR monitoring strategy for these chemicals; to review by OSPAR in 2003 of the need for further OSPAR measures to supplement the eventual EC measures; and to ask other relevant international forums to take account of the background document. A monitoring strategy for Certain Brominated Flame Retardants has been added to this background document...|$|E
