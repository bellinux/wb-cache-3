5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> but {{the final}} day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E

Australia batted {{strongly}} and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already ahead by 580. He made nine before his partner Ray Lindwall was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460. This left England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 5/294 {{meant that}} {{the first of the}} bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning.

5|$|Johnston {{took the}} new ball with Miller and {{delivered}} 59 overs {{in the second}} innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success {{in the first half}} of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day</b> as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 10 leadthe Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E

5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day</b> so he could attack the English openers {{for a short period}} before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63.

In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day.</b> Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was {{compounded by the fact that}} Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day</b> of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{breathing}} exercises {{are widely used}} in the postoperative care to prevent or reduce pulmonary complications, but no scientific evidence for the efficacy has been found after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The aim of the thesis was to describe postoperative pulmonary function and to evaluate the efficacy of deep {{breathing exercises}} performed {{with or without a}} blow bottle device for positive expiratory pressure (PEP) 10 cmH 2 O or an inspiratory resistance-positive expiratory pressure (IR-PEP) mask with an inspiratory pressure of - 5 cmH 2 O and an expiratory pressure of + 10 to + 15 cmH 2 O. Patients undergoing CABG were instructed to perform 30 slow deep breaths hourly during daytime for the first four postoperative days. Patient management was similar in the groups, except for the different breathing techniques. Measurements were performed preoperatively, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> and four months after surgery. The immediate effect of the deep breathing exercises was examined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second postoperative day. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gases. Atelectasis was determined by chest roentgenograms or spiral computed tomography (CT). Lung volumes were markedly reduced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> postoperative <b>day.</b> Four months after surgery the pulmonary function was still significantly reduced. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second and <b>fourth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> all patients had atelectasis visible on CT. A single session of deep breathing exercises performed with or without a mechanical device caused a significant reduction in atelectasis and an improvement in oxygenation. No major differences between deep breathing performed with or without a blow bottle or IR-PEP-device were found, except for a lesser decrease in total lung capacity in the blow bottle group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> postoperative <b>day.</b> Patients who performed deep breathing exercises after CABG had significantly smaller atelectasis and better pulmonary function <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> compared to a control group who performed no exercises...|$|R

5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{around the}} death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests that Michael Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day.</b> The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace. The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak says that Michael Shishman was captured and killed by {{the son of the}} Serbian king, Stephen Dušan. He was buried in the Church of St George in Staro Nagoričane.|$|E
5|$|The {{light was}} again poor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> but England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} {{to erase the}} deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England {{would not be in}} the lead should a sticky wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.|$|E

5|$|The {{momentum}} swung in Australia's favour. Harvey scored 112, while Loxton made 93, {{hitting a}} further five sixes from Laker. Lindwall added 77 {{late in the}} afternoon as Australia finished at 9/457 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> having added 394 in one day's play. At the start of the second innings, Miller bowled a tight opening spell and the English openers scored only five from his six overs as they tried to establish a solid start. Miller took 1/53 in the second innings, removing Bedser and catching Compton yet again as Australia was set a world record chase of 404 on the final day in just 345 minutes. A 301-run second wicket partnership between Morris and Bradman set up the run-chase and Miller came in with the score at 2/358. He made only 12 but Australia won by seven wickets to set a new world record and take a 3–0 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively.

They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict.

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia {{proceeded}} to reach 460/7Keith Miller making 74before Bradman declared, setting England {{a target of}} 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>day,</b> but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
