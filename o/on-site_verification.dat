Among its innovations are provisions for facility agreements to govern <b>on-site</b> <b>verification</b> inspections of certain facilities. A facility agreement is an agreement or arrangement between a State Party and the Organization [for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] relating to a specific facility subject to <b>on-site</b> <b>verification</b> pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 6.

Traditionally, the government examines the entire project, which includes project pre-feasibility study, project determination reports rule, project mid-term examination, and accreditation council before the project is completed. However, because the accreditation council is usually as short as several hours, specialists just can check the files which the auditee expects the auditor to examine and can’t have a real perception about the project.

Additionally, typhoons and torrential rains cause debris flows and flooding in metropolitan areas and threaten {{the safety of}} people’s lives and properties. Disaster prevention and reduction of damage caused by typhoons and torrential rains {{have always been a}} crucial task of government agencies. Bridges in Taiwan are generally old and have insufficient shock resistance; some bridge foundations are also severely eroded and exposed. Because of global climate changes in recent years, rainfall has become comparatively heavy and rapid. Furthermore, the soil in mountain areas has softened because of factors such as earthquakes or human developments. Debris rushes down with rain every time a torrential rain strikes, significantly impacting the safety of bridges downstream. Although government bridge management units have made budget plans to progressively renovate dangerous old bridges, these bridges are still being use for traffic and transportation. These dangerous old bridges pose a serious threat to the safety of people when an earthquake, typhoon, or flood occurs. During typhoons and floods, increased water levels and changes of the scouring depths have dramatic effects on the safety of bridges. The bridge maintenance unit currently uses the water level and water flow conditions as references when determining whether to close a bridge; however, {{this is not a good}} permanent solution. A bridge scour monitoring and warning system that is stable, reliable, and operates normally under flood attacks is required for <b>on-site</b> installation and <b>verification.</b> In recent years, the applied technologies of smart phones have expanded beyond entertainment and communication.

This framework comprises three key parts: (1) video positioning of forest insect damage based on digital elevation model (DEM) and the parameters obtained from the pan-tilt-zoom camera, (2) integration of two-dimensional/three-dimensional geographic information system and video surveillance to provide more intuitionistic monitoring and assistance for positioning, (3) <b>on-site</b> <b>verification</b> conducted by ground surveys and guided through global positioning system (GPS) integrated in the embedded devices.

The primary {{objective of the}} current study was to establish, using ground truthing (<b>on-site</b> <b>verification),</b> the validity of measures of availability of food stores and physical activity establishments that were obtained from commercial database and Internet searches. A secondary objective was to examine differences in validity results according to neighbourhood characteristics and commercial establishment categories. Methods Lists of food stores and physical activity-related establishments in 12 census tracts within the Montreal metropolitan region were compiled using a commercial database (n = 171 establishments) and Internet search engines (n = 123 establishments). Ground truthing through field observations was performed to assess the presence of listed establishments and identify those absent. Percentage agreement, sensitivity (proportion of establishments found in the field that were listed), and positive predictive value (proportion of listed establishments found in the field) were calculated and contrasted according to data sources, census tracts characteristics, and establishment categories. Results Agreement with field observations was good (0. 73) for the commercial list, and moderate (0. 60) for the Internet-based list. The commercial list was superior to the Internet-based list for correctly listing establishments present in the field (sensitivity), but slightly inferior in terms of the likelihood that a listed establishment was present in the field (positive predictive value). Agreement was higher for food stores than for activity-related establishments. Conclusion Commercial data sources may provide a valid alternative to field observations and could prove a valuable tool in the evaluation of commercial environments relevant to eating behaviour.

While supplying the population with sufficient water, the reduction of NRW has been a key issue in judging the performance of all water utilities. Background loss is one component of physical losses which is the most to contribute to NRW. This study aimed on pressure management method conducted at a site to reduce background loss. The pressure management method used is by the installation of a Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV) with timer-based pressure cut-off controller as an <b>on-site</b> <b>verification.</b> The BE 59 - Kg. Melayu Pandan, one of the District Meter Area (DMA) in Johor Bahru has been selected as a case study. The Step Tests are carried out to analyse and identify the steps with high background leakage and to find suitable location for the purpose of PRV installation. The DMA meter and a data logger are used to measure and record pressure and flow profiles to determine leakage at each step and to establish leakage baselines, before and after the activation of the PRV. The results indicated a high reduction of background loss and given significant impact on the NRW level in Johor Bahru. In financial terms, volume of water saved and the monthly expenditure shows the return of investment (R. O. I) is in a period of 6 months. This research findings show a higher reduction on background loss can be achieved by optimising the cut-off controller, analysing further excess pressure cutoff based on pressure profiles in the existing or new DMA with a PRV and controller in a large scale. Comparisons with other methods of pipe replacement and Active Leakage Control (ALC), indicate that, the pressure management by excess pressure cut-off is the most feasible, economical and effective method in the NRW reduction...|$|E

Iowa Code §§ 421. 17 (17) and 441. 21 (h) provide that assessment jurisdictions follow the guidelines and rules in this manual to help achieve uniformity in assessments. Assessors are encouraged to use the International Association of Assessing Officers’ Standard on Mass Appraisal of Real Property in their mass appraisal practices. Estimating market value in mass appraisal involves accurately listing properties, developing a sales file that includes the primary influences on market value, and developing models for subsets of properties that share common market influences using recognized mass appraisal techniques. The assessment of an individual property should not be {{based solely on the}} sale price. The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) standard 6 says “In developing a mass appraisal, an appraiser must be aware of, understand, and correctly employ those recognized methods and techniques necessary to produce and communicate credible mass appraisals. ” Accurate listing of property is the basis of a good mass appraisal program. On-site inspection and listing of property is essential in developing a good data base for revaluation. A physical review, including an <b>on-site</b> <b>verification</b> of property characteristics, should be conducted at least every four to six years. Land values should be reviewed every two years. Factors influencing the market of each property type should be identified and collected so that these factors can be considered in the mass appraisal model. It is equally important to maintain the data once it is collected. Accessing local government permit systems should {{be a part of a}} good data maintenance program along with an inspection program. Current cadastral maps and geographical information systems (GIS) are tools that are integral in checking accuracy of listings and maintaining a comprehensive data base. ...|$|E
