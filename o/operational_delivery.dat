The Tunnan was produced in five principal variants, these being the J 29A (the first model to enter service), J 29B and J 29E for the fighter mission, the S 29C for the reconnaissance mission, and the afterburner-equipped J 29F fighter, which was the final variant. From 1950 to 1956, at which point manufacturing was terminated, a total of 661 Tunnans were completed, making it the largest production run for any Saab aircraft.|$|R

25|$|Five Combat Talon IIs were {{delivered}} in 1985 {{but the problem}} of acquiring a navigation radar had not been resolved (the APQ-122 was no longer being built). IBM was contracted {{to develop a new}} terrain following/avoidance radar, who then subcontracted the task to Emerson Electric Company. The resulting radar performed so poorly that the Combat Talon II was nearly cancelled, but special operations advocates in Congress kept the program alive. Ultimately the AN/APQ-170(V)8 radar was developed into a system that exceeded specifications, but at a large cost overrun and with a further three-year delay in the Combat Talon II becoming <b>operational.</b> <b>Deliveries</b> in 1987, 1988, and 1989 brought the inventory to 18 aircraft, but all were still in modification, testing, or long term storage.|$|R

5000|$|Since I {{originally}} {{defined the}} Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums {{is not a}} [...] "meta Scrum". The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done {{at the end of}} the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an <b>operational</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|Psimon {{appears in}} the Young Justice episode [...] "Bereft", voiced by Alan Tudyk. Often when giving mental {{commands}} he will say [...] "Psimon says...." [...] to whomever {{he is trying to}} control. He was in collaboration with the Bialyan government in studying an extraterrestrial sphere that was sent from another world. Psimon was responsible for wiping the memories of the team when they were on a mission to Bialya. When Psimon tried to erase Miss Martian's mind again, they both end up in a mental battle. With help from Superboy after restoring his memories, Miss Martian manages to defeat Psimon and send him flying. Psimon later reports to the Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors) on his failure with the sphere and recapturing Superboy. L-4 of the Light reveals however that the operation can be considered a success given that the Light's newest partner has an <b>operational</b> <b>delivery</b> system that sent them the extraterrestrial sphere. In [...] "Image," [...] Psimon works with Queen Bee into brainwashing Rumaan Harjavti into giving up Qurac to Queen Bee. Miss Martian catches up to Psimon who uses his mind attacks to cause Miss Martian to turn into her true form being a White Martians. When Robin, Kid Flash, and Superboy catch up, Miss Martian brain blast them, before she ends up in another mental battle with Psimon as he digs deeper into Miss Martian's mind to see that her biggest fear would be the Justice League and the team finding out that Miss Martian is actually a White Martian (specifically Superboy, who says [...] "Love you? I can't even look at you!") and being expelled back to Mars. Miss Martian then turns the tides on Psimon in anger and defeats him, leaving him drooling on the floor. Even though Psimon was defeated, the info Psimon learned from Miss Martian was somehow given to Queen Bee. In [...] "Beneath," [...] Psimon comes out of his catatonic state and assists Mammoth, Shimmer, Icicle Jr., and Devastation into guarding a shipment of runaway children who are to be delivered to The Light's Partner. Psimon knows that Batman is off of the planet at the time. When Batgirl does her infiltration, Psimon knocks her out with a psychic attack enabling the other villains to capture Batgirl. When Miss Martian infiltrates the ship disguised as Shimmer, Psimon easily identifies her and notifies the other villains. Miss Martian and Psimon end up in a psychic fight. With help from Bumblebee, Miss Martian manages to defeat Psimon. In [...] "True Colors," [...] Vandal Savage borrows Psimon in order to help Black Manta get Aqualad's mind back to normal. In [...] "Fix," [...] Psimon tries to work on Aqualad until it turned out that Tigress has drugged him with a formula made by Sportsmaster. Psimon attacks her until he collapses upon Black Manta's arrival.|$|E

40|$|The ‘Bikeability’ cycle {{training}} scheme, a flagship {{policy of}} the government in England, aims to give children the skills and confidence to cycle more safely and more often. Little, however, is known about the scheme׳s reach. We used <b>operational</b> <b>delivery</b> data to examine which primary schools in England offered Bikeability. Predictors included the deprivation level of the student body and the local prevalence of cycling. We then examined cycle training participation using data from 6986 participants (age 10 – 11) in the nationally-representative Millennium Cohort Study. Parents reported whether their child had completed formal cycle training, along with other child and family factors. We used operational data to identify children whose school had previously delivered Bikeability...|$|E
40|$|Disodium glycyrrhetinic acid hemiphthalaic (GAP) was {{evaluated}} for developmental toxicity in pregnant NMRI mice.

On gestation day of IS, after <b>operational</b> <b>delivery,</b> the fetuses were examined for soft tissue, external and skeletal defects. "nIncreased absorptions, dead fetuses, and reduce fetal body weight per litter were observed at doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg/day.

40|$|Managing {{organisational}} {{performance in}} sectors such as equipment provision {{has become increasingly}} complex as competition has heightened and firms have felt pressure to add value through the provision of services (Baines et al, 2007; Howard and Caldwell, 2011; Neely et al., 2011). This provision is {{commonly referred to as}} the servitization of manufacturing (Vandermerwe & Rada, 1988). By extending the traditional offering of equipment to include service activities however, underlying <b>operational</b> <b>delivery</b> systems and processes have become more complex to manage and co-ordinate. No longer are firms simply making and shipping products; they are now engaged in a more complex world of design and delivery (Neely et al., 2011).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to frame the {{perception}} differences between the buyer and supplier on the supply chain’s <b>operational</b> <b>delivery,</b> and to investigate their causal relation to the overall supply chain performance. A conceptual 3 -level Model is developed to theorise the structural existence of the perception gaps in primarily a dyadic buyer-supplier setting. Using the primary data gathered through a major survey exercise, confirmative factor analysis and structural equation modelling were conducted to test the hypotheses on the significance and relevance of the perception gaps in supply chain management. This study provides a better conceptual understanding of the perception differences on the required as well as achieved operational deliveries within the supplier-buyer dyad, and reveals their significant and negative causal impact on the overall supply chain performance...|$|E

The difficulty in such projects is that there may be hundreds of thousands of design and implementation decisions to be made - once the architecture is agreed.
