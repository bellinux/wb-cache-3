5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the <b>Opalite</b> Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E

40|$|In this paper,an attempt {{has been}} made to briefly present the {{potential}} of the nonmetallic mineral resources in the Republic of Macedonia. A presentation of the condition of the nonmetallic mineral resources is done with a compilation approach, and the given data are result of the various types of geological research, done continuously during a long period of time. A special attention will be paid to the economical significant locations, and for some of them there will be a suggestion of perspective areas for further research. The nonmetallic mineral resources are mostly located in the range of the Pelagonian massif (locations and presence of feldspars,micas, marbles, marble onyx, dysten, staurolites, granites, syenites, diatomaceous earth, etc.) but there are also many other locations which are not equally located and other geotectonic units, like bentonite, secondary quartzite, native sulfur, <b>opalites,</b> etc., (Serbian-Macedonian massif), then the talc, marl, travertine, etc., (Vardar area), plaster, marbles, etc., (Western Macedonian area). ...|$|R

50|$|McDermitt's {{economy has}} {{historically}} been based on mining, ranching and farming. In the period 1917 to 1989 it was home to four nationally significant mercury mines in the McDermitt CalderaBretz, <b>Opalite,</b> Cordero and McDermittwhich from 1933 to 1989 were the largest producers in North America. In 1985 of the 16,530 flasks of mercury (each containing 76 pounds (34.473 kg)) produced in the US, 16,337 came from the McDermitt Mine. The closure of mercury mining in 1990 resulted in a significant decline in population.|$|E

40|$|Glass Buttes, a Pliocene silicic {{volcanic}} complex {{within the}} High Lava Plains province of Oregon, was erupted approximately 5. 0 to 5. 8 million years ago. Geologic mapping {{revealed that the}} eastern portion of the complex is underlain by rhyolitic glass domes, flows and rare pyroclastis flows. Basalt flows are interlayered with and onlap the silicic glass. Younger basalt flows, erupted from local vents, overlie silicic glass and onlapping basalts. The eastern end of Glass Buttes is hydrothermally altered at the surface; a weak geothermal anomaly coincides with the altered areas. Alteration, localized by northwest trending normal faults, occurs primarily as <b>opalite</b> replacement of rhyolite glass with associated cinnabar, alunite, clay-rich vein material, hematite, and hyalite. Alteration paragenesis at the surface was defined, and physicochemical conditions during hydrothermal activity were inferred from alteration minerals and assemblages and trace element content of alteration minerals. Alteration identified in the subsurface is interpreted {{to be related to}} an older hydrothermal system. Carbonate, pyrite, quartz, and minor smectite and chlorite occur in vugs and fractures, and partially replace subsurface basalt. Abundant fine-grained disseminated pyrite occurs in permeable units. Pyrite separates from disseminations and veins within basalt and permeable glassy units contain up to 13 ppm Au. The pyrite samples are also anomalous with respect to arsenic and antimony...|$|E
40|$|Aas~or: The opal mining {{areas of}} inland Australia have {{exposures}} {{in which a}} systematic association between ear-surface silcrete and one or more silicified horizons at depth is displayed. In the Stuart Creek opal field, the deepest horizons are <b>opalite</b> and glassy quartzites in which all primary sedimentary structures are conserved. Higher in the section, lenses and nodules of quartzite occur in bleached, unconsolidated sands. Near {{the top of the}} section, a nodular and columnar silcrcte displays numerous illuviation features. At the base of the section, the earliest phase of silicification is the pseudomorphic replacement of sedimentary clay minerals by opal. Subsequently, void linings of micro-laminated opal were formed, and fibrous silica was precipitated in residual cavities. In the middle part of the section, sedimentary clay minerals were replaced by microcrystalline quartz, while silicifieation of clay-free sands was achieved by overgrowth ofdetrital quartz grains. In both cases, residual voids were filled with chalcedony and euhedral quartz. In {{the upper part of the}} section, silicifieation produced microcrystalline quartz in the matrix of the host sediment and in titania-rich illuviation laminae at the base of voids and channels. The near-surface silcrete displays many features relating to infiltration and downward percolation of water. Variable rates of water percolation, as well as alternating periods of leaching and deposition, are inferred from macro- and micro-scale structures and fabrics. The presence of microquartz indicates that solutions contained comparatively low silica concentrations, but enough impurity elements to restrict he growth of large crystals. In the deepest horizons, the preservation of sedimentary structures, the occurrence of micro-laminated void cutans of silica, an...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} uranium geochemistry of diagenetically altered volcaniclastic sediments from {{parts of}} the western United States. Geochemical criteria based on analysis of selected volcaniclastic samples {{are found to be}} useful in recognizing functional uranium source rocks and act as a frame work and guide for future exploration for uranium in new areas. Comparison of the chemical composition of samples from different localities studied show that Ca, Fe and Mg are enriched relative to silicic igneous rocks. Lack of uranium enrichment in the zeolite facies samples in this study contrasts with the results of others that zeolites adsorb U. It {{is important to note that}} the efficiency of adsorption is a function of pH. High pH associated with zeolite formation favors U desorption. The association of uranium with <b>opalite</b> is illustrated by moderate positive correlation of U with Si. The association of U with silica is explained by the fact that both U and Si are released during diagenesis and by the fact that opal coprecipitates with U. High correlation of U with organic carbon in the Anderson Mine and Reese River samples indicate the ability of carbonaceous matter to adsorb and/or precipitate U. High Th/U ratio (more than 7) represent highly leached systems which have released a significant quantity of U to the ground water system. Low Th/U ratios (less than 2) are found in mineralized units, while Th/U ratios between 2 and 7 represent systems closed to U and Th. In systems that have not lost U the samples plot very close or on the trend found in unaltered igneous rocks on a log U-log Th graph. The scatter and relative position of the points relative to the igneous trend indicate whether the system has lost or gained uranium. In geologic systems that have not lost or gained uranium such as unaltered igneous rocks, the triangular variation diagram of Th-U-K shows a tight group that is closer to and projects to the Th corner. In systems that have lost or been enriched in U, the data points are scattered in the triangle. In systems in which there is uranium mineralization, the samples plot in a trend that projects to the U corner. The best indicator elements for U mineralization in volcaniclastic sediments are organic carbon, V, Mo, As, and Cu. Uranium has moderate positive correlation with Cs and Th in systems closed to uranium...|$|E
