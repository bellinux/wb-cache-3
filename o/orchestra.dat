5|$|The Peabody <b>Orchestra,</b> {{formed in}} 1866, {{was the first}} {{professional}} <b>orchestra</b> in Baltimore. The <b>Orchestra</b> premiered many works in its early years, including some by Asger Hamerik, a prominent Danish composer who became director of the <b>Orchestra.</b> Ross Jungnickel founded the Baltimore Symphony <b>Orchestra</b> before 1890, when the <b>Orchestra</b> first performed, and the Peabody <b>Orchestra</b> ceased to exist. Jungnickel's <b>orchestra,</b> however, lasted only until 1899.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the Berlin Philharmonic <b>Orchestra,</b> {{under its}} {{conductor}} Wilhelm Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts {{by the same}} <b>orchestra</b> in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the comparatively poor standards of London orchestras. Both the BBC and Sir Thomas Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways; the BBC established the BBC Symphony <b>Orchestra</b> under Adrian Boult, and Beecham, together with Malcolm Sargent, founded the London Philharmonic <b>Orchestra.</b>|$|E

Rodziński and the <b>orchestra</b> recorded it that same year, and there have been several modern recordings of the work since, notably one by John Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl <b>Orchestra.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which the {{economic}} challenges faced by symphony <b>orchestras</b> in the United States reflect collectively bargained wage increases and work rules. Since the late 1960 s, collective bargaining agreements have transformed the artistic expenses of <b>orchestras</b> from variable to fixed costs by providing both wage and employment guarantees. The resulting agreements limit the ability of <b>orchestras</b> to adjust labor costs in the face of financial challenges, and the paper presents econometric evidence indicating that musicians' wages are not significantly correlated with measures of their <b>orchestra's</b> financial balance. The paper discusses features of the nonprofit governance of symphony <b>orchestras</b> which reduces the bargaining resistance of <b>orchestras</b> to wage and employment security proposals. ...|$|R
5|$|On May 12, the Oregon Symphony {{repeated}} {{the program at}} the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, marking the orchestra's Carnegie Hall debut.

5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic <b>Orchestra,</b> {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself.

Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died.
