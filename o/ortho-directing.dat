40|$|Tese de dout., Química, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2012 The {{demand for}} enantiopure {{compounds}} in society motivates chemists to develop methods for asymmetric synthesis. Asymmetric catalysis is central in this context, its development significantly {{depending on the}} discovery of new successful chiral ligands. Ferrocenes represent powerful and unique chiral ligands which may contain a chiral plane. Such chirality is often built in the ferrocene backbone via diastereoselective ortho-lithiation and functionalization of monosubstituted ferrocenes containing a chiral <b>ortho-directing</b> group (CDG). Accordingly the oxazaphospholidine oxide group has been studied allowing highly stereoselective synthesis of planar chiral 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocenes. Herein we expand on the exploration of this interesting group aiming to further access on its potential for the synthesis of useful chiral ferrocenyl phosphines to be applied in catalysis. Thus observation of two P-epimers during {{the formation of the}} starting ferrocenyl oxazaphospholidine oxide led to the synthesis of novel ligands, including diastereopure 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocenes with opposite planar chirality, as shown below. Additional investigation included a second lithiation step at the 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocenes, preparation of P-chiral ligands based on stereoselective induction by the oxazaphospholidine oxide, and its reduction, all together leading to new structures. Coordination chemistry and catalysis involving our ligands were approached revealing oxazaphospholidine oxide group ability to act as a hemilabile ligand coordinating to palladium at the phosphoryl oxygen. The ligands displayed potential activity, both on the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling and Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation, this last case involving moderate enantioselectivities, up to 70 % ee.

The work is introduced by {{an overview of the}} significance of conformationally constrained amino acids in chemical biology. An example of how a potent and selective conformationally constrained tryptophan was designed and synthesized is provided. This section also reviews constrained phenylalanine analogues, detailing the influence of their constraints on their stereochemistry. The introductory Chapter ends with the description of an investigation into the use of a conformationally constrained phenylalanine analogue, Tic, in the development of potent bioactive peptides, and a discussion of the potential applications of higher homologues of Tic. The second Chapter commences with a short discussion about asymmetric synthesis and chiral resolution, followed by an example which illustrates these concepts. This is followed by a discussion on the work done in the modification and optimization of the Gibson synthesis of the amino acid Sic, which gave multigram quantities of this amino acid. Attempts to resolve racemic Sic were unsuccessful. The next Chapter begins with an introduction to aromatic C-H bond activation and a discussion of conventional Heck and oxidative Heck methodologies used in C-C bond formation. The syntheses of three novel cyclization substrates with varying degrees of electron densities in their aromatic rings are documented. Attempts to achieve intramolecular cyclization of these molecules via the Fujiwara addition method, the Gaunt oxidative Heck method and the Glorius oxidative Heck method, are described. The fourth Chapter introduces the concept of aromatic C-H bond activation via chelation assistance. A concise survey of different functional groups that are commonly used as <b>ortho-directing</b> groups via chelation with organometallic catalysts is presented along with an example that illustrates how this methodology has been used to synthesize potentially bioactive compounds.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScOver the years, Giles and {{co-workers}} have established that, upon treatment with potassium tert-butoxide, tetra-substituted naphthalenes undergo cyclisations to afford naphthopyrans. It was suggested that these base-induced cyclisations {{was as a}} result of the reacting centers being forced into close proximity as a consequence of steric crowding. This thesis describes the synthesis of 3 -allyl- 4 -ethyl- 2 -(1 ′-hydroxyethyl) - 1 -methoxy-naphthalene 177 and its behaviour towards Pd(0) and potassium tert-butoxide under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, to verify whether the base-promoted cyclisations are indeed caused by the steric influences of the substituents. Two synthetic routes were attempted in the synthesis of the target naphthalene 177. The first of these attempted routes involved the conversion of 2 -acetyl- 4 -hydroxy- 1 -methoxynaphthalene 182 into 2 -acetyl- 1 -methoxy- 4 -trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy-naphthalene 191 and subsequently into 2 -acetyl- 4 -ethyl- 1 -methoxynaphthalene 192 via Stille coupling. However, the subsequent Snieckus <b>ortho-directed</b> metalation reactions on the reduced 4 -ethyl- 2 -(1 ′-hydroxyethyl) - 1 -methoxynaphthalene 193, and analogues of it, to afford naphthalene 177 were unsuccessful. The second route entailed a Claisen rearrangement of the tri-substituted 2 -acetyl- 4 -allyloxy- 1 -methoxynaphthalene 209 to afford the unstable tetra-substituted 2 -acetyl- 3 -allyl- 4 -hydroxy- 1 -methoxynaphthalene 210, which was immediately converted into the corresponding 2 -acetyl- 3 -allyl- 1 -methoxy trifluoromethanesulpholnyloxynaphthalene 211. Stille coupling of the triflate 211 gave the 2 -acetyl- 3 -allyl- 4 -ethyl- 1 -methoxy-naphthalene 212, which was subsequently reduced to the target naphthalene alcohol 177.

Conformational rigidity {{was expected to}} reduce {{the side effects of}} these drugs by limiting their binding to multiple receptors. <b>Ortho-directed</b> metalation followed by acylation provided synthetic intermediates for the formation of the desired pentacyclic congeners. The known dilithiation of phenothiazine and iminodibenzyl and n-butyllithium, followed by acylation with dimethylformamide, gave carboxaldehydes at the 1 and 4 positions respectively. Ortho-lithiated nicotinamides were acylated by these aldehydes exclusively at the 4 position to provide the key intermediate alcohol amides. Difficulties in amide hydrolysis are discussed. Catalytic hydrogenation over palladium-on-carbon in refluxing acetic acid yielded carboxylic acids, apparently via the gamma-lactones formed in situ. The lactones could not be isolated easily due to instability to oxidation. Pentacyclic lactams were formed by dehydration, and borane was used to reduce the carbonyl function. Only the iminodibenzyl lactam was reduced, and problems encountered in subsequent pyridine ring reduction are discussed. Cis and trans ring fusion isomers were identified by ¹³C nmr. Attempted one-pot synthesis of this pentacycle and a regioisomer by double acylation of 4, 5 -dilithioiminodibenzyl with 2, 3 -pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride, and 3, 4 -pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride failed. Mechanistic considerations are discussed regarding regiochemistry and reactivity of the nitrogen and carbon anions involved. Ortho-lithiation of 3 -bromopyridine to form 3 -pyridyne {{in the presence of the}} preformed N-lithioiminodibenzyl- 4 -carboxaldehyde was unsuccessful in providing a pentacyclic benzonaphthyridinobenzazepine.

Metallacycle 10 was also isolated from the reaction of (η⁶-C₆Me₆) Ta(DIPP) ₂Cl with 3, 5 -lutidine. Examination of both crude reaction mixtures by ¹H NMR revealed 10 to be the major product without any indication of the formation of η²-lutidine species. These observations suggest that η²(N,C) -coordination of 3, 5 -lutidine is kinetically incompetitive with respect to the cyclometalation of DIPP by d² tantalum. Such undesired reactivity of DIPP can be potentially inhibited by the use of linked aryloxide ligands to prevent close approach of metalatable C-H bonds of DIPP to the metal center.
