In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan.

5|$|Emergency {{crews of}} the government's Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> (DSS) visited {{locations}} throughout the region, receiving damage claims, requests for monetary aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. The Commonwealth pledged to provide $150million in relief {{over a three-year}} period to the government of Queensland in exchange for deregulation; however, its offer was initially rejected. Planes flew claims adjusters and other officials to Innisfail, establishing an insurance emergency service in the city hall, while the Insurance Council of Queensland deployed its special emergency service employees for the first time. As a result of severe damage, a disaster declaration for northern regions was issued by Queensland Government on 4February. The first $10million in aid from the state government, paid by the federal government, was supplied the same day. Meanwhile, the SES continued its cleanup efforts, removing debris and repairing structures. Looters took advantage of confusion in the days following the cyclone, striking residences throughout Innisfail. By the end of the day, 2200tarpaulins had been distributed; however, the previously-smooth relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms in Cairns.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the days following the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

40|$|Because {{they ignore}} the household-level and {{macroeconomic}} adjustments associated with longevity improvements, the actuarial projections <b>of</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> Administration overestimate the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> crisis. Using a general-equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets, I show that accounting for these adjustments, a significantly smaller decline in benefits {{is needed to}} balance the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> budget. Households respond to the longevity improvements by delaying retirement and <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefit collection, working more hours, and by also saving more. In general equilibrium, these effects lead to a natural expansion <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> tax base and generate significant delayed retirement credits, which the actuarial estimates completely overlook. ...|$|R

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes.

Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>security,</b> an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
