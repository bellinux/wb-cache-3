5|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage {{was the first}} major test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical reservation established in the Peace of Augsburg, 1555. His loss of the Electorate strengthened the Catholic counter reformation in the northern German states, gave the Jesuits a stronghold in Cologne, and expanded the Wittelsbach family influence in imperial politics.|$|E
5|$|Other {{mathematical}} achievements include deriving {{an accurate}} approximation of pi, defining and investigating the spiral bearing his name, {{and creating a}} system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He {{was also one of}} the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding hydrostatics and statics, including an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the lever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.|$|E
5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> nonviolence, he was {{the first}} to apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E

5|$|Henson's {{beliefs on}} {{doctrine}} were still forming, but he inclined to high-churchmanship and {{was influenced by}} Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by more extreme Anglo-Catholic forms of ritualism. With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> establishment– the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion– and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, {{to counter the threat}} of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{superposition}} to combine waves {{in a way}} that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
5|$|The rule {{evolved from}} the {{principle}} of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision-making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Each deputy to a Sejm was elected at a sejmik (the local sejm for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm. Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> political equality.|$|E

5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|E. Budin {{collected}} the first specimen {{of the species}} on August 21, 1917, in Jujuy Province, northwestern Argentina, {{and the next year}} Oldfield Thomas used the animal as the holotype of a new subspecies of Akodon puer, a Bolivian species. He described the new subspecies Akodon puer cænosus as darker and duller in color than the Bolivian form, but otherwise identical. In 1920, Thomas recognized additional differences between the two after examining more specimens and classified the Argentine form as a separate species, Akodon cænosus. Most subsequent authors followed this arrangement, but since the 1980s some have placed the form (now spelled caenosus) in A.puer again. In 1990, Philip Myers and others reviewed the Akodon boliviensis group, which includes A.puer and A.caenosus, and again considered caenosus as a subspecies of puer. They retained caenosus as a separate subspecific name for the Argentine populations of puer because of its small size, dark fur, and distinctive karyotype. Myers and colleagues had included the name lutescens J.A. Allen, 1901, as a subspecies of Akodon puer Thomas, 1902, and in 1997 Sydney Anderson noted that the older name lutescens should instead be used for the species because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Priority; therefore, he utilized the combination Akodon lutescens caenosus for the Argentine subspecies. Through the 1990s and 2000s, authors continued to differ on the classification of caenosus as either a full species or a subspecies or puer (=lutescens).|$|E
