5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in {{the vastness of the}} Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear is a tear {{of one or}} more of the tendons of the four rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. A rotator cuff 'injury' can include any type <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> or overuse of those muscles or tendons, and is among the most common {{conditions}} affecting the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|An {{inflamed}} bursa {{is called}} bursitis. Tendinitis and impingement syndrome are {{often accompanied by}} inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis. Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and impingement.|$|E

25|$|Eastern {{yellow jackets}} destroy many insects that consume {{cultivated}} and ornamental plants, providing {{a valuable service}} to humans. They can, however, be a source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> when their nests are located near homes. They are adept at stinging, especially if the nest is threatened. Not {{to be confused with}} certain bees that die after a single sting, these wasps may sting repeatedly whenever they feel it necessary and can inflict a very painful sting.|$|E
25|$|Another source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> was the {{regional}} assemblies, {{which had been}} organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP {{wanted them to be}} more or less advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.|$|E
25|$|Bound feet : On {{sleepers}} {{made since}} the 1980s, {{the soles of}} the feet usually attach to the upper foot pieces with an inward-facing seam. In preceding years, it was more common for the seam to face outward, and to be covered with a narrow strip of material, forming a kind of ridge {{around the perimeter of}} the sole. This design was referred to in advertisements as a bound edge or bound foot, and was intended both to improve durability, and to improve comfort by eliminating a potential source <b>of</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Dermatitis is a {{group of}} skin {{conditions}} that includes atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination <b>of</b> <b>irritation,</b> allergy, and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet. Allergic contact dermatitis, however, can occur following brief exposures to substances a person is sensitive to.|$|E
25|$|Democrat Party is an epithet for the Democratic Party in the United States, {{used in a}} disparaging fashion by the party's opponents.

While there is grammatical argument regarding the propriety of use of both of the terms, with ending and without, ongoing use of the shortened term for political ends is a source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> to members of the Democratic Party.|$|E

A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began {{during the early stages}} of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases <b>of</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1872, the Tongzhi Emperor turned 17. Under the {{guidance}} of the Empress Dowager Ci'an, he was married to the Jiashun Empress. The empress's grandfather, Prince Zheng, was one of the eight regents ousted from power in the Xinyou Coup of 1861. He had been Cixi's rival during the coup and was ordered to commit suicide after Cixi's victory. As a consequence, there were tensions between Cixi and the empress, and this was often a source <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> for Cixi. Moreover, the empress's zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a goat. According to Cixi's belief, it was a warning from the gods that she would eventually fall prey to the empress.|$|E
25|$|When {{the lens}} first {{contacts}} the eye, {{it should be}} comfortable. A brief period <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, {{taking a break from}} lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.|$|E
25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known <b>of</b> <b>irritation</b> of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.|$|E

25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of acute poisoning. In this study, two adult cats and one kitten were fed a puréed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed nothing that would suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The forced feeding study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the tube feeding bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs <b>of</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|E
