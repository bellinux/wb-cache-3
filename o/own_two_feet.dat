500|$|Ryan Bray, {{writer for}} Consequence of Sound, {{concluded}} So was an [...] "all-too-rare record that manages {{to have it}} both ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving so much as an artistic inch". He added that [...] "it still stands on its <b>own</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> as one of the consensus best records of the 80s". Mark Blake of Q described the album as [...] "carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths". He added that [...] "Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd." [...] Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote [...] "Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence." [...] Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed [...] "a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole".|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his thought}} process towards the material, Vaughn {{said he was}} {{motivated}} by [...] "unfinished business" [...] with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both X-Men: The Last Stand and Thor. Vaughn declared {{that he was more}} enthusiastic about First Class than The Last Stand due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to [...] "start fresh", while [...] "nodding towards" [...] the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared First Class to both Batman Begins (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 Star Trek film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was [...] "to make as good a film that could stand on its <b>own</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> regardless of all the other films" [...] and also that could [...] "reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise". Goldman added the film was kind of an [...] "alternate history" [...] for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers {{did not want to go}} fully [...] "against the canon of the X-Men trilogy", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.|$|E

[...] Seli Graves referred to the character as [...] "delightfully," [...] and [...] "deliciously devious." [...] Us Magazine hailed the character as the bitchiest new character of the year in 1977.

60|$|However, I {{have nothing}} in {{particular}} to say about his early and active days, but rather of the time when, an old man, he had become the owner of vast estates by the means I have signified--among them the great manor of Stapleford, on which he lived, in the splendid old mansion now pulled down; likewise estates at Marlott, estates near Sherton Abbas, nearly all the borough of Millpool, and many properties near Ivell. Indeed, I can't call to mind half his landed possessions, and I don't know that it matters much {{at this time of}} day, seeing that he's been dead and gone many years. It is said that when he bought an estate he would not decide to pay the price till he had walked over every single acre with his <b>own</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet,</b> and prodded the soil at every point with his own spud, to test its quality, which, if we regard the extent of his properties, must have been a stiff business for him.|$|E
60|$|As Want was {{the prime}} foe these hardy exodists had to {{fortress}} themselves against, {{so it is}} little wonder if that traditional feud be long in wearing out of the stock. The wounds of the old warfare were long a-healing, and an east-wind of hard times puts a new ache into every one of them. Thrift was the first lesson in their horn-book, pointed out, letter after letter, by the lean finger of the hard schoolmistress, Necessity. Neither were those plump, rosy-gilled Englishmen that came hither, but a hard-faced, atrabilious, earnest-eyed race, stiff from long wrestling with the Lord in prayer, and who had taught Satan to dread the new Puritan hug. Add two hundred years' influence of soil, climate, and exposure, with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies, {{and we have the}} present Yankee, full of expedients, half-master of all trades, inventive in all but the beautiful, full of shifts, not yet capable of comfort, armed at all points against the old enemy Hunger, longanimous, good at patching, not so careful for what is best as for what will do, with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket, not skilled to build against Time, as in old countries, but against sore-pressing Need, accustomed to move the world with no [Greek: pou sto] but his <b>own</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet,</b> and no lever but his own long forecast. A strange hybrid, indeed, did circumstance beget, here in the New World, upon the old Puritan stock, and the earth never before saw such mystic-practicalism, such niggard-geniality, such calculating-fanaticism, such cast-iron-enthusiasm, such sour-faced-humor, such close-fisted-generosity. This new Græculus esuriens will make a living out of anything. He will invent new trades as well as tools. His brain is his capital, and he will get education at all risks. Put him on Juan Fernandez, and he would make a spelling-book first, and a salt-pan afterward. In coelum, jusseris, ibit,--or the other way either,--it is all one, so anything is to be got by it. Yet, after all, thin, speculative Jonathan is more like the Englishman of two centuries ago than John Bull himself is. He has lost somewhat in solidity, has become fluent and adaptable, but more of the original groundwork of character remains. He feels more at home with Fulke Greville, Herbert of Cherbury, Quarles, George Herbert, and Browne, than with his modern English cousins. He is nearer than John, by at least a hundred years, to Naseby, Marston Moor, Worcester, and the time when, if ever, there were true Englishmen. John Bull has suffered the idea of the Invisible to be very much fattened out of him. Jonathan is conscious still that he lives {{in the world of the}} Unseen as well as of the Seen. To move John you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding; an abstract idea will do for Jonathan.|$|E
