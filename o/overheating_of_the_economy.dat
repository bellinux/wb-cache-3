That is, banks tend to contract their lending activity when there are business downturns because of their concern about loan quality and repayment probability.

In contrast, banks expand their lending activity during boom periods, thereby contributing to a possible <b>overheating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> that may transform an economic expansion into an inflationary spiral.

Setting the central parity at which they will join has been {{and will be a}} {{challenging}} task, as there is a considerable amount of uncertainty, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, surrounding the determination of the optimal exchange rate.

40|$|Changes in {{monetary}} policy are typically implemented gradually, an empirical observation known as interest-rate smoothing. We propose {{an explanation of}} optimal interest-rate smoothing by applying the recent lesson from the related literature on the monetary transmission mechanism that time-non-separable preferences may be key to understanding dynamics in a monetary economy. We find that when consumers have “catching-up-with-the-Joneses” preferences, optimal {{monetary policy}} does react gradually to exogenous shocks {{in order to prevent}} <b>overheating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> In addition, the Friedman Rule is sub-optimal because the inflation tax reduces the distortion caused by the externality. We also extend our basic model to investigate the effects of capital formation and staggered price-setting on the dynamics of optimal monetary policy. Abstracting from capital formation but introducing staggered price-setting, dynamic optimal policy is largely unchanged. Allowing for capital formation but with prices flexible, optimal policy becomes excessively gradual in the absence of adjustment costs of capital. When both staggered price-setting and capital formation are present, optimal policy again matches fairly well the size and speed of nominal interest-rate adjustments found in U. S. data. Our results emphasize that interest-rate smoothing may be needed simply to guide the economy to an optimally smooth path and need not arise because of uncertainty on the part of policy-makers {{about the state of the}} economy, which has been one of the main explanations offered for gradualism. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{surge of}} private capital flows to {{developing}} countries {{that occurred in the}} 1990 s has been the most significant phenomenon of the decade for these countries. By the middle of the decade many developing countries in Asia and Latin America were awash with private foreign capital. In contrast to earlier periods when the scarcity of foreign capital dominated economic policy-making in these countries, the issue now for governments was how to manage the largescale capital inflows to generate higher rates of investment and growth. While a number of developing countries were able to benefit substantially from the private foreign financing that globalisation made available to them, it also became apparent that capital inflows were not a complete blessing and could even {{turn out to be a}} curse. Indeed, in some countries capital inflows led to rapid monetary expansion, inflationary pressures, real exchange rate appreciation, financial sector difficulties, widening current account deficits, and a rapid build-up of foreign debt. In addition, as the experience of Mexico in 1994 and the Asian crisis of 1997 - 98 demonstrated, financial integration and globalisation can cut both ways. Private capital flows are volatile and eventually there can be a large reversal of capital because of changes in expected asset returns, investor herding behaviour, and contagion effects. Such reversals can lead to recessions and serious problems for financial systems. This paper examines the characteristics, causes and consequences of capital flows {{to developing countries}} in the 1990 s. It also highlights the appropriate policy responses for governments facing such inflows, specifically to prevent <b>overheating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and to limit the vulnerability to reversals of capital flows. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter finds that—over {{the medium}} term—a more {{developed}} domestic financial market increases {{the volume and}} helps reduce the volatility of capital flows to emerging markets. Specifically, the estimation results find that, although growth is the primary determinant {{of the level of}} capital inflows, equity market liquidity and financial openness also help attract capital inflows. Moreover, financial openness is associated with lower capital inflow volatility. These results, which are consistent with the views expressed by institutional investors, point to the advantages of focusing on the medium-term goal of improving the quality of domestic financial markets. By adopting such a focus, emerging market countries will be {{in a better position to}} maximize the benefits of capital inflows while dealing with their potential volatility. The recent surge in capital flows to emerging market economies has stirred an intense debate about the appropriate policy response to this development. On the one hand, capital inflows are welcome because they encourage investment, help deepen financial intermediation, and, therefore, enhance economic development. However, in large sums over short time spans they can also impose policy challenges relating to upward pressure on the exchange rate, <b>overheating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and asset price bubbles. They also pose the risk of an abrupt reversal, potentially having negative real economic effects. This chapter analyzes the domestic determinants of capital inflows, with a view to assessing what actions emerging market countries can take to maximize the benefits of those inflows while minimizing the threat to financial stability. In particular, the chapter examines the influence of domestic financial markets on capital inflows, putting the large capital inflow increases to emerging markets that have occurred since 2002 within a medium-term perspective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to investigate consumption in the United States from 1952 to 2013. Consumer sentiment was the main explanatory variable, along with Real Gross Domestic Product, prime interest rate, unemployment rate, and recession. Consumption was measured in personal consumption expenditures. Consumer sentiment was measured with the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index survey. The research used Ordinary Least Squares as the methodology of estimating the parameters in the regression. The results revealed that when consumer sentiment increased by one point, personal consumption expenditures decreased, suggesting some predictive abilities in the consumer sentiment measure. The consumer sentiment variable was negative and significant {{in all of the}} regressions completed. The Real Gross Domestic Product variable was positive and significant at all levels each of the regressions. Contrary to economic theory, the log of the unemployment rate variable was positive in the regressions run. However, it was remained insignificant in each regression. It was recommended that the government lower taxes when consumer sentiment is low to prevent impending consumption expenditure declines that could lead to recession. An implication of this fiscal policy was that it would increase disposable income, which could increase aggregate consumption. A negative implication of this policy was a potential <b>overheating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Suggestions for further research were adding a race variable to investigate consumption patterns between races. Another suggestion for additional research is to split the time periods into two separate regressions: one examining consumption from 1952 to 1982 and a second regression from 1983 to 2013.
