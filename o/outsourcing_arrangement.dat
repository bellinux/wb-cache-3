This paper presents two case studies concentrating on the customer role in projects using outsourcing and extreme programming (XP). The studies follow an interpretive approach based on in-depth interviews, and suggest some tensions between some contractual <b>arrangements</b> in <b>outsourcing,</b> and the XP process. In particular, one suggests XP worked well {{in the context of}} their particular <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and the other study suggests difficulty in aligning XP with a different set of <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> ...|$|R

We report on research into Australian IT outsourcing conducted in 1999.

40|$|Service {{providers}} {{expected to}} see a simplification regarding security and compliance management as standards and best practice were applied to complex information technology (IT) <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> However, security and compliance management became even more complex and is presenting greater challenges to service providers than ever before. In this article, {{we focus on the}} work practices of service providers dealing with complex and transitory security requirements and distributed IT infrastructures. Based on the results of semi-structured interviews followed by a think-aloud study, we first describe specific requirements to be met by software supporting security and compliance management in complex IT <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and discuss the extent to which existing software already meets them. We show that existing software, which is primarily designed for in-house settings, fails to meet requirements of complex IT <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> such as (1) the use of standardized and formal descriptions of security requirements and configurations, (2) the definition of a interface allowing to exchange messages and to delegate tasks, (3) the provision of mechanisms for designing and implementing a configuration for specific security requirements across organizational boundaries, (4) the provision of mechanisms for verifying and approving the enforcement of these security requirements, and (5) the provision of mechanisms for searching and browsing security requirements, configurations and links between them. We then propose a software architecture that claims to be capable of meeting those requirements and outline how this claim was evaluated by means of another think-aloud study in which potential end users were asked to perform a series of tasks using a prototypical implementation of the architecture. The results of the evaluation confirm that the software meets the described requirements and suggests that it facilitates the management of security and compliance in complex IT <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R

40|$|Corporates are {{entering}} {{the brave new world}} of the internet and digitization without much regard for the fine print of a growing regulation regime. More traditional <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> are already falling foul of the regulators as rules and supervision intensifies. Furthermore, ‘shadow IT’ is proliferating as the attractions of SaaS, mobile, cloud services, social media, and endless new ‘apps’ drive usage outside corporate IT. Initial cost-benefit analyses of the Cloud make such arrangements look immediately attractive but losing control of architecture, security, applications and deployment can have far reaching and damaging regulatory consequences. From research in financial services, this paper details the increasing body of regulations, their inherent risks for businesses and how the dangers can be pre-empted and managed. We then delineate a model for managing these risks specifically focused on investigating, strategizing and governing <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> and related regulatory obligation...|$|R

40|$|Complex IT <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> promise {{numerous}} benefits such {{as increased}} cost predictability and reduced costs, higher flexibility and scalability upon demand. Organizations trying to realize these benefits, however, face several security and compliance challenges. In this article, we investigate the pressure to take action with respect to such challenges and discuss avenues toward promising responses. We collected perceptions on security and compliance challenges from multiple stakeholders {{by means of a}} series of interviews and an online survey, first, to analyze the current and future relevance of the challenges as well as potential adverse effects on organizational performance and, second, to discuss the nature and scope of potential responses. The survey participants confirmed the current and future relevance of the six challenges auditing clouds, managing heterogeneity of services, coordinating involved parties, managing relationships between clients and vendors, localizing and migrating data and coping with lack of security awareness. Additionally, they perceived these challenges as affecting organizational performance adversely in case they are not properly addressed. Responses in form of organizational measures were considered more promising than technical ones concerning all challenges except localizing and migrating data, for which the opposite was true. Balancing relational and contractual governance as well as employing specific client and vendor capabilities is essential for the success of IT <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> yet do not seem sufficient to overcome the investigated challenges.

Another early example of pension fund investment outsourcing involved General Dynamics. In November 1994 General Dynamics became the first client when its treasurer formed a new outsourced investment firm, Fiduciary Asset Management.

In 2001 another of the early large pension <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> occurred when Xerox hired General Motors Asset Management (GMAM) to manage its $4 billion defined pension plan.

40|$|Parties acting opportunistically are a {{major concern}} in many buyer-supplier relationships, {{especially}} in strategic <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The extant literature has focused mainly on opportunistic behavior of suppliers and the safeguards that buyers need {{to put in place}} to protect their interests. Buyers can also act opportunistically; however, this side of the dyadic relationship has not received adequate attention and remains an under researched area. We address this imbalance by establishing the antecedents of buyer opportunism and strategies to manage this. Based on the transaction cost economics theory, we tested a model consisting of three factors that could give rise to buyer opportunism with dyadic data from 51 <b>outsourcing</b> <b>arrangements</b> between firms in Australia. Our results indicate that only one predictor, frequency of exchange, had a significant and positive effect on buyer opportunism. The other two factors, investments made by suppliers and uncertainty, were not significant. These findings show that, in contrast to what has been found previously for suppliers, only one factor gives rise to buyer opportunism. The results suggest that buyers&# 039; opportunism can be controlled by the frequency of transactions that takes place.
