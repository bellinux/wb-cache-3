25|$|In 1959 during Dr. Theodore G. Lilley’s pastorate, {{the church}} merged with First United Presbyterian Church. With this church, which {{stood on the}} {{north-east}} corner of Summer St. and Richmond Ave. additional gifts for expansion became available; this was realized in 1968, during the pastorate of Dr. Arthur W. Mielke, D.D. The sanctuary underwent additional modifications, this time, the chancel was extended, the communion table enlarged by the same craftsmen that carved the <b>original</b> <b>table,</b> the pulpit and lectern were also redesigned, and the dividing wall in the chancel was removed to reduce congestion.|$|E

500|$|The catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of}} the <b>original</b> <b>table</b> readings, harking back to an {{incident}} when she was in high school. Cartwright was in the marching band at Fairmont High School, and one day while performing, the band chanted [...] "Eat my shorts" [...] rather than the usual [...] "Fairmont West! Fairmont West!" [...] Bart's other catchphrases, [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!", were featured on T-shirts manufactured during the production of the early seasons of The Simpsons. [...] "Cowabunga" [...] is also commonly associated with Bart, although it was mostly used on the show after it had been used as a slogan on the T-shirts. The use of catchphrase-based humor was mocked in the episode [...] "Bart Gets Famous" [...] (season five, 1994) in which Bart lands a popular role on Krusty the Clown's show for saying the line [...] "I didn't do it." [...] The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular".|$|E
500|$|In 1989, {{the shorts}} were spun {{off into a}} half-hour show on the Fox network called The Simpsons. Bart quickly became the show's {{breakout}} personality {{and one of the}} most celebrated characters on television—his popularity in 1990 and 1991 was known as [...] "Bartmania". Bart was described as [...] "television's brightest new star" [...] by Mike Boone of The Gazette and was named 1990's [...] "entertainer of the year" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Despite Bart's fame, however, Cartwright remained relatively unknown. During the first season of The Simpsons, Fox ordered Cartwright not to give interviews, because they did not want to publicize the fact that Bart was voiced by a woman. Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have [...] "no obvious traces of Bart", and she believes her role is [...] "the best acting job in the world" [...] since she is rarely recognized in public. When she is recognized and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright refuses because it [...] "freaks [...] out". Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the <b>original</b> <b>table</b> readings, referring to an incident from her high school days. Once while performing, members of the Fairmont West High School marching band switched their chant from the usual [...] "Fairmont West! Fairmont West!" [...] to the irreverent [...] "Eat my shorts!" [...] Cartwright felt it appropriate for Bart, and improvised the line; it became a popular catchphrase on the show.|$|E
500|$|Bartholomew JoJo [...] "Bart" [...] Simpson, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is the eldest child and only {{son in the}} family—at age 10. Bart's most {{prominent}} character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name [...] "Bart" [...] is an anagram of the word [...] "brat". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of the}} <b>original</b> <b>table</b> readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared {{on the cover of the}} December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which lead some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, [...] "We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons." [...] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990–2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!" ...|$|E
