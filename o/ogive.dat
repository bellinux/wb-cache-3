The choirs {{of the church}} possibly had <b>ogive</b> and rose windows like those at Vadstena Castle.

25|$|It {{was only}} {{during the period of}} the Reconquista that the Castle began to gain a {{specific}} form. Integrated into the Portuguese Crown after 1240, the monarchs took various steps to increase settlement and establish an authority within the region. They did this by reconstructing and reformulating the defences {{during the second half of}} the 13th century. In 1240, Alcoutim was taken by the forces loyal to King Sancho II of Portugal, who ordered the reconstruction of the castle and wall to defend the population. At the same time, Sancho elevated the settlement to the status of town. King Denis of Portugal restored the castle and walls during his reign, at the same time (1304) conceding a foral (charter) to the settlement, transferring its title to the Order of São Tiago. Unfortunately, little remains of the primitive medieval castle. In fact, there are no monographs that depict the transition between the Moorish settlement and early Portuguese settlements What did remain were the two <b>ogive</b> gates, which hinted as to its Gothic military structure.|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} floor {{was added to the}} tower {{in the middle of the}} 14th century, the sloping ridged roof of the earlier terrace was {{retained}} and became the floor of the new room. The rib vaulting is divided into three bays instead of two as on the lower two floors. The carved corbels and ceiling bosses are less skilful executed that those on the first floor. The room was originally lit by openings in six niches of which two were windows and four were arrowslits. Those with arrowslits were blocked when the tower was used as a prison and have not been reopened. The arches of the niches differ from those on the lower floors; they have an <b>ogive</b> shape rather than a semi-circular form. The fireplace is set into the north wall. There is an entrance to a gardrobe in the southwest corner of the room. The position is surprising as it would have been almost above the quarters of the châtelain and it is possible that the structure was originally a bartizan which was converted into a gardrobe when the upper floors were used as a prison.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ogives</b> are {{alternating}} wave crests {{and valleys}} that appear as {{dark and light}} bands of ice on glacier surfaces. [...] They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier. [...] <b>Ogives</b> are formed when ice from an icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer. [...] This creates a swale and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in turn creates a ridge. [...] Sometimes <b>ogives</b> consist only of undulations or color bands and are described as wave <b>ogives</b> or band <b>ogives.</b>|$|R

[...] After obtaining the permission of the Jones family, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on paperboard from the house's front yard. This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced <b>ogive</b> than the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work; however, Wood did not add figures to the sketch until he returned to Cedar Rapids. He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.|$|E

40|$|Population {{assessments}} of chondrichthyan species require several key parameters of their reproductive biology, which were estimated for Squalus megalops (Macleay, 1881). Length-at-maturity differed {{depending on the}} criterion adopted for defining maturity. In the case of males, length-at-maturity was smallest when condition of seminal vesicles was adopted as a maturity criterion. For females, length-at-maturity was smallest when the largest follicle diameter > 3 mm was adopted as the criterion for maturity; this was appropriate only {{as an indicator of}} the onset of maturity. Mature males are capable of mating throughout the year. Females have a continuous asynchronous reproductive cycle. The sex ratio of embryos is 1 : 1 and litter size and near-term embryo length increase with maternal length. Females have an ovarian cycle and gestation period of two years. This was reflected in the differences found between the maturity and maternity <b>ogives.</b> Although all females are mature at 600 mm, only 50 % of them contribute to annual recruitment each year. Hence, for chondrichthyan species with reproductive cycles of two, three or more years, if maturity <b>ogives</b> are used in population assessments instead of maternity <b>ogives,</b> the models will overestimate recruitment rates.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{criteria}} for judging the status of an exploited fish population {{is the size of}} the spawning stock or spawning stock biomass (SSB). Maturity data are the basic information to estimate maturity <b>ogives</b> that allow the estimation of the SSB. Maturity <b>ogives</b> are estimated based on length/age stock structure and sex ratio. Traditionally, fish maturity has been determined macroscopically, based on morphological features of gonads both, testis and ovaries. Nevertheless, maturity <b>ogives</b> based on histological data give more accurate estimation of SSB, however this approach is not always feasible due to the cost, both in time and resources, of histological process. Because of these, several alternative maturity indices, easier and quicker estimated, are being developing. Usually, macroscopic maturity scales change not only among species but also between laboratories. The lack of common criteria makes comparison between labs studies difficult. International efforts to harmonize maturity staging criteria has been or are being carried out trough Workshops organization (WKMSHM- 2007, WKMSCWHS- 2007, Workshop on Gonadal Histology of Fishes- 2009, Workshop on Maturity of Greenland halibut and redfish- 2010, etc.), nevertheless, there is not a standard guide to coordinate different laboratories protocols. This chapter standardizes maturity staging criteria in order to create maturity scales bases on easily identifiable morphological features of gonads, both, testis and ovaries. Besides, different histological samples processing and treatments are presented as well as microscopic maturity scales for species that present different reproductive strategies (gonochoristics vs hermaphrodites; determinate vs indeterminate, synchronous vs asynchronous, etc.), for both sexes. On the other hand, alternative, indirect and accurate maturity classification methods based on somatic and biochemical indices are described.

But these estimates were obtained including information from both DEPM and acoustic surveys: maturity data from the DEPM for each stratum and year were combined to obtain stock estimates, using abundances at age from acoustic surveys as weighting factors; however, in most years, 1 - 2 months lagged between the two surveys in W and S strata. Revision of weights at age could not be carried out in 2012 due to time constraints, but the WGHANSA believes that it makes more sense that both life history parameters be derived from the same surveys.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between catches from deepwater trawl and longline surveys (1993 – 2000) in the Northeast Atlantic.

Comparative trawl and longline surveys of the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough (west and north of Ireland) were used to examine size-selectivity. Trawls and longlines selected for significantly different size frequency distributions of Centroscymnus coelolepis and Deania calceus, though not for Centrophorus squamosus. These data highlight some important aspects of behavior of the species studying relation to fishing gears. Smaller C. coelolepis were selected by longlines than trawls, suggesting that smaller sharks were present at a considerable height above the seabed, {{out of reach of}} trawls, but attracted to baited hooks. In the case of D. calceus, larger females were selected by hooks, but were not present in trawl catches, possibly indicating their ability to escape towed gears.
