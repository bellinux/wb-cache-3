5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, {{well known}} pastor and {{prosperity}} gospel advocate, Creflo Dollar launched a fundraising campaign {{to replace a}} previous private jet with a $65 million Gulfstream G650. [...] On the August 16, 2015 episode of his HBO weekly series Last Week Tonight, John Oliver satirized prosperity theology by announcing that he had established his own tax-exempt church, called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption. [...] In a lengthy segment, Oliver focused on what he characterized as the predatory conduct of televangelists who appeal for repeated gifts from people in financial distress or personal crises, and he criticized the very loose requirements for entities to obtain tax exempt status as churches under U.S. tax law. [...] <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> that he would ultimately donate any money collected by the church to Doctors Without Borders.|$|E
500|$|Phil Matson, East Perth premiership {{player and}} coach, {{regarded}} Harold Oliver {{as the best}} centre man he had met during his football career. Angelo Congear, whose career completely overlapped with <b>Oliver,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "As an all-roundplayer, Harold Oliver is my pick. In his prime he played a wonderfully clever game anywhere. He is also the fairest player {{it has been my}} pleasure to play with." [...] Tom Leahy, Magarey Medalist and captain of North Adelaide, once stated after a game at Alberton Oval that [...] "North Adelaide would certainly have won had Port not possessed a superman in Oliver." [...] Vic Richardson, captain of the Sturt Football Club and Australian cricket team, described Harold Oliver as being [...] "The finest all-round exponent of Australian football in my playing and watching experience of it".|$|E

500|$|Between the 8th and 11th centuries, [...] "three major {{cultural}} divisions" [...] {{had emerged}} in Great Britain: the English, the Scots and the Welsh, the earlier Brittonic Celtic polities in what are today England and Scotland having finally been absorbed into Anglo-Saxon England and Gaelic Scotland {{by the early}} 11th century. The English had been unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh. Before then, the English (known then in Old English as the Anglecynn) were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states, {{the most powerful of}} which were Mercia and Wessex. Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> that the Battle of Brunanburh would [...] "define the shape of Britain into the modern era", it was a [...] "showdown for two very different ethnic identities – a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon. It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms, a split in perceptions which is still very much with us today". However, historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely [...] "responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood" [...] in the 13th century. Scottish national identity, [...] "a complex amalgam" [...] of Gaelic, Brittonic, Pictish, Norsemen and Anglo-Norman origins, was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|Amanda Longacre, who was crowned Miss Delaware 2014 and was {{preparing}} to compete in Miss America 2015, was stripped of the title and the crown because she was deemed to be too old. Longacre filed a $3 million lawsuit, and Miss America officials later blamed the error on state pageant officials whom, they said, [...] "missed the age discrepancy in Longacre's submitted paperwork." [...] Miss New York 2014 (Kira Kazantsev) eventually won the title of Miss America 2015, making New York {{the first state to}} produce a winner for three consecutive years. Shortly after Kazantsev was crowned in September 2014, however, comedian John Oliver ran a segment on his show, Last Week Tonight, that investigated the Miss America Organization's claim that it is [...] "the world's largest provider of scholarships for women." [...] Oliver's team, which included four researchers with journalism backgrounds, collected and analyzed the organization's state and federal tax forms to find that the organization's scholarship program only distributes a small fraction of its claimed [...] "$45 million made available annually". <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> that at the national level, the Miss America Organization and Miss America Foundation together spent only $482,000 in cash scholarships in 2012. Oliver found that at the state level, the Miss Alabama pageant claimed that it had provided $2,592,000 in scholarships to Troy University despite not actually distributing any such scholarships. The pageant appeared to multiply the value of a single available scholarship by the number of contestants theoretically eligible for it, while using the term [...] "provided" [...] in a way that did not mean [...] "distributed." [...] The Miss America Organization responded by stating that Oliver affirmed that it provides the most scholarships to women and that the $45 million figure was based on all scholarships made available {{whether or not they are}} accepted.|$|E
6000|$|He ventured {{gently on}} kindly hopes that his uncle was better, {{and they were}} not ill taken, though not without fretfulness. Presently <b>Oliver</b> <b>said,</b> 'Come to look after your sister? that's right--good girl, good girl!' ...|$|E

60|$|Miss <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> {{that she}} had grown fond of him, and the dog, after {{standing}} up with a paw upon the man's knee, dropped down on all fours {{at the sound of}} her voice and trotted back to her without waiting for another pat.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, {{turning to}} <b>Oliver,</b> <b>said</b> that Mr. Grimwig {{was an old}} friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy {{creature}} at bottom, as he had reason to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{might as}} well stay home, too, {{for all the good}} church will do me today," [...] Miss <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> to Rilla, as they walked down the hard-frozen red road to the church. [...] "I can think of nothing but the question, 'Does the line still hold?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Humph!' <b>said</b> <b>Oliver,</b> {{with a dry}} sound, {{apparently}} expressing, 'So that is {{what our}} Parliament is made of. Father well?' he asked.|$|R

60|$|<b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> nothing, but obeyed his mother's direction. He {{went into}} the barn-yard, and he found Amos and Jonas at work in a shed beyond, getting down a sled which had been stowed away there during the summer. It was a large and heavy sled, and had a tongue {{extending}} forward to draw it by.|$|E
60|$|Mr. <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> nothing further, and by and by, when a thin haze {{rolled down}} from the {{hillside}} and night closed in, they strolled toward the rancherie, where {{they were given a}} strip of floor space not far from the entrance. The boys came in a little later and lay down apart from them and nearer the door, but Frank did not go to sleep. The rancherie was hot and the dull roar of the combers on the reef came throbbing in and made him restless. He lay still for what seemed a considerable time, and at last there was a low sound which might have been made by somebody rising stealthily, after which a dim black object flitted out of the door. Then Harry, who lay close to him, touched his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, how comes it, sir," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Oliver,</b> [...] "that Cornishmen are so {{much more}} {{addicted}} to wrestling than other Englishmen?" ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{had been}} {{crouching}} {{on the step}} for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what {{it had taken him}} a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from {{the opposite side of the}} way. He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to <b>Oliver,</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Rilla woke {{that morning}} when the dawn was {{beginning}} to break and went to her window to look out, her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep. Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time. The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder. Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows. There was no wind, and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down {{in the direction of}} the station. Was it Dog Monday? And if it were, why was he howling like that? Rilla shivered; the sound had something boding and grievous in it. She remembered that Miss <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> once, when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl, [...] "When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing." [...] Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart. It was Dog Monday--she felt sure of it. Whose dirge was he howling--to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell? ...|$|E
60|$|They {{formed a}} new Council of State after this {{extraordinary}} proceeding, {{and got a}} new Parliament together in their own way: which Oliver himself opened {{in a sort of}} sermon, and which he said {{was the beginning of a}} perfect heaven upon earth. In this Parliament there sat a well-known leather-seller, who had taken the singular name of Praise God Barebones, and from whom it was called, for a joke, Barebones's Parliament, though its general name was the Little Parliament. As it soon appeared that it was not going to put Oliver in the first place, it turned out to be not at all like the beginning of heaven upon earth, and <b>Oliver</b> <b>said</b> it really was not to be borne with. So he cleared off that Parliament in much the same way as he had disposed of the other; and then the council of officers decided that he must be made the supreme authority of the kingdom, under the title of the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, Dave was at {{home with}} me,” <b>said</b> <b>Oliver</b> Wadsworth. “But he {{and one of his}} friends passed the works just before the explosion.” ...|$|R
