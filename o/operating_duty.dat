40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{interleaved}} buck converter (IBC) having low switching losses and improved step-down conversion ratio, which {{is suitable for}} the applications where the input voltage is high and the <b>operating</b> <b>duty</b> is below 50 %. It {{is similar to the}} conventional IBC, but two active switches are connected in series and a coupling capacitor is employed in the power path, such as Cuk, Sepic, and Zeta converters. The proposed IBC shows that since the voltage stress across all the active switches is half of the input voltage before turn-on or after turn-off when the <b>operating</b> <b>duty</b> is below 50 %, the capacitive discharging and switching losses can be reduced considerably. This allows the proposed IBC to have higher efficiency and operate with higher switching frequency. In addition, the proposed IBC has a higher step-down conversion ratio and a smaller output current ripple compared with a conventional IBC. The features, operation principles, and relevant analysis results of the proposed IBC are presented in this paper. The validity of this study is confirmed by the experimental results of prototype converters with 150 – 200 V input, 24 V/ 10 A output.

"May 2013 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are of interest due to their small size, low cost, tunability, and excellent beam quality. Moreover, the near infrared {{is one of the most}} interesting regions in the electromagnetic spectrum because of various applications. In fact, many environmental and gas sensing applications are dedicated to this region. VCSELs are able to generate good power output in the NIR region compared to other types of lasers. However, the output power is limited by the amount of heat generated inside the active region of these devices. In addition, the output varies with the operating temperature of the laser due to unwanted transitions that occur between the energy states of the active medium. In this thesis, the temperature sensitivity of a previously designed VCSEL device emitting at 2 um is fabricated, and the optical output is studied extensively. The characteristic temperature is recorded and analyzed at different <b>operating</b> <b>duty</b> cycles showing a linear relationship between the temperature sensitivity and the <b>operating</b> <b>duty</b> cycle in pulsing mode.

During the testing of AC electrical devices quite often it is necessary to obtain a hysteresis weber-ampere characteristic. When the magnetic material is magnetized by the alternating field, hysteresis loop that characterizes the energy consumption per cycle of magnetization reversal is expanding due to the appearance of eddy current losses and loss by aftereffect. The aim of the study is to develop a method for determining the hysteresis weber-ampere characteristics on the basis of {{the solution to the}} inverse problem of harmonic balance for electrical devices.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an Interleaved Buck Converter (IBC) with {{continuous}} input current, {{extremely low}} output current ripple, low switching losses and improved step-down conversion ratio. Unlike the conventional IBC, the proposed converter has continuous input current and its output current ripple is extremely low. The proposed converter has lower voltage stress {{in comparison to}} the conventional IBC and also can provide a high step-down ratio which makes it a proper choice for high power applications where non-isolated step-down converter with low output current ripple and continuous input current is required. The proposed IBC shows that the voltage stress across all the active switches is half of the input voltage before turn-on or after turnoff when the <b>operating</b> <b>duty</b> is below 50 %. Also the proposed converter can provide current-sharing between two interleaved modules without using additional current-sharing control method. All these benefits are obtained without any additional stress on the circuit components. The simulation is done by using MATLAB 7. 12. 0 (R 2014 a) ...|$|E

In addition, we propose a least leakage vector (LLV) assisted technology mapping to optimize the total power of the final mapped network.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} evaluates {{whether there}} is a necessity and possibility for Fraport, operator of Frankfurt Airport, to apply a different approach to <b>operate</b> its <b>duty</b> free business, in order to improve the performance of this very important revenue stream. Due to a changing industry context, airports have to rethink the role of airport retailing within their organisation and, in particular, have to thoroughly scrutinise their approach to <b>operating</b> the <b>duty</b> free business. With respect to this, the view of international airport retail experts constitutes the basis for identifying the required resources, for assessing retailing as a core competence and for evaluating the consequences for the operation model that is applied to manage the duty free business. The author suggests that there is a mutual causal relation between airport's development of retail competence and the self-operation model of the duty free business. Whether such an approach is successful or not, significantly depends on the organisation's resource base, its reason to be and its cultural reality. Therefore, in seeking to reach a comprehensive notion of the strategic decision - how to <b>operate</b> the <b>duty</b> free business - the dissertation investigates the influence of the airport's reason to be and Fraport's cultural reality. Finally, it draws a conclusion with regard to {{whether there is}} a strategic logic for an airport-owned retail model and whether this is in harmony with the cultural reality at Fraport...|$|R
