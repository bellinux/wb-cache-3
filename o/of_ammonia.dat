NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
40|$|Some {{time ago}} there {{appeared}} in this periodical two publications!) 2) containing {{criticism of the}} report of an investigation entitled "Stoichiometric Number and Reaction Mechanism <b>of</b> the <b>Ammonia</b> Synthesis " 3), which we published in 1959. In the present publication we shall deal with the main points of this criticism. The determination of the stoichiometric number of the rate-determining step <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis was made in two ways: a. First series of measurements: Near the equilibrium <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis we measured simultaneously, and on {{one and the same}} portion of catalyst, the rates <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis and <b>of</b> the exchange reaction (I) b. Second series of measurements: Near the equilibrium <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis we measured, simultaneously on two series-arranged catalyst beds and in one and the same gas stream, both the rate <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis and the rates of the exchange between N;o and N; 8 (exchange reaction II) and the exchange between N~o and NH 3. The rates <b>of</b> the <b>ammonia</b> synthesis and the exchange between N; 0 and NH 3 were measured on the first catalyst bed, the rate of the exchange between N;o and NiB on the second. All these reaction rates can be characterized under the given conditions by first-order reaction rate constants. The accuracy of the determination of these constants is largely determined by the location of the equilibrium. This applies in particular to the constants for the ammonia synthesis...|$|R
