5|$|Initially Bueno's mother {{claimed to}} be the {{absolute}} owner of his recorded material as well as profits. Judge Ricardo Sangiorg of the 76th Civil Court froze all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> held in bank accounts and copyrighted material hosted by SADAIC and the Argentine Musician's Union, as requested by the legal group Cúneo Libarona-Ballester, the representatives of Patricia Pacheco and her son Ramiro. Pacheco claimed that Ramiro Pacheco was the legitimate son of Bueno and requested a DNA test to verify it. The lawyers sent legal notices to Olave, her lawyer Miguel Angel Pierri and Gozalo stating that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> of Bueno's estate could be used or spent until it was decided which one of the parties would inherit them.|$|E

5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> will revert to government.|$|E
50|$|Basis risk {{in finance}} {{is the risk}} {{associated}} with imperfect hedging. It arises because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference between <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> to be hedged and <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> serving as <b>the</b> hedge, or because of a mismatch between <b>the</b> expiration date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hedge <b>asset</b> and <b>the</b> actual selling date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> (calendar basis risk), or—as in energy—due to the difference in <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> to be hedged and <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> serving as <b>the</b> hedge (locational basis risk).|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> {{purchaser}} <b>of</b> an {{intangible asset}} {{is allowed to}} amortize <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> as an expense for tax purposes, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is enhanced by this tax amortization benefit.

On July 9, 2003, the company acquired all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> of workflow provider and advertising software company Engage for $1.2million and assumed its $650,000 debt after Engage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Engage was {{the parent company}} of both Cascade and MidSystems, which were two of the first companies that tried to automate prepress production for newspapers and large printers. On August 15, 2003, Scene7 acquired its top competitor, TrueSpectra of San Mateo, for an undisclosed amount of cash and stock. On June 15, 2004, Scene7 raised $7.5million in another round of financing, led by home shopping company QVC with some of Scene7's existing investors. At the same time, Jeffrey Branman, President of Interactive Technology Partners at QVC, and David Rubenstein, co-founder of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, joined Scene7's board of directors, which was composed of James Caccavo of Moore Capital, Andrew Wright of RealNetworks, and Mack.|$|E
5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E
5|$|They were {{initially}} {{managed by the}} British Transport Commission, but control passed to British Waterways {{with the passing of}} the Transport Act 1962, which also disbanded the Transport Commission. The Transport Acts of 1968 and 1983 divided British canals into Commercial waterways, which were still carrying commercial traffic, cruising waterways, which had potential for leisure use, and remainder waterways, for which no economic use could be seen at the time. The Stainforth and Keadby was designated as a commercial waterway, and traffic was restricted to working boats carrying freight. With the steady demise of freight traffic, British Waterways encouraged the use of the canals for leisure cruising, walking and fishing, and later recognised their environmental value. Following the cessation of coal carrying from Hatfield Main colliery, and the closure of Dunston's boatyard at Thorne, all use of the canal is now by leisure boaters. A further change of ownership took place in 2012 with the creation of the Canal & River Trust, which took over all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> of British Waterways.|$|E

25|$|In {{considering}} an asset-based approach, the valuation professional {{must consider}} whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued {{would have any}} authority to access the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may {{have the authority to}} direct the corporation to sell all or part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets.</b> As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value.
