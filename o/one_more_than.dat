5|$|Aston Villa {{currently}} {{hold the}} {{record number of}} league goals scored by any team in the English top flight; 128 goals were scored in the 1930–31 season, <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Arsenal who won the league that season {{for the very first}} time, with Villa runners-up. Villa legend Archie Hunter became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign.

5|$|Manchester United and Arsenal took {{immediate}} action by fining {{a number of}} their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the {{extremely}} stable {{configuration of the}} noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{winners were}} Belgian club Molenbeek, who {{defeated}} Ajax 5–2 in the final. The hosts {{are the most}} successful club in the tournament's history, having lifted the trophy on ten occasions. The club won their first title in 1978 and their most recent success came in 2004. Fellow Dutch side AZ and English club Arsenal are the only other teams to have won the competition more than once. Feyenoord, Ajax's domestic rivals, are {{among a group of}} clubs to have won the tournament once, while Belgium has produced the most individual winners, four, <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> England and Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|A 1–0 {{victory against}} Coventry City meant Arsenal were five points behind Sheffield Wednesday, who lay in third spot. Arsenal {{continued}} their strong finish {{to the season}} by scoring seven goals {{in the space of}} three days – three away to Norwich City and four at home to Crystal Palace. The team, without the suspended Wright for the trip to Sheffield United came away from Bramall Lane with a point. Arsenal beat Liverpool 4–0 on 21 April 1992, which marked the opposition's biggest defeat in nine years. A draw at Chelsea ended Arsenal's chances of finishing in a UEFA Cup place. Arsenal ended the league campaign with a 5–1 win against Southampton at home. Wright overtook Tottenham striker Gary Lineker as the league's top goalscorer by scoring three on the day which took his total to 29 (24 of those scored for Arsenal) – <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Lineker.|$|E
5|$|Calgary and Canmore {{became the}} heart of winter sport in Canada as CODA (now known as Winsport Canada) {{established}} itself as the nation's leader in developing elite athletes; in 2006, one-quarter of Canada's Olympic athletes were from the Calgary region and three-quarters of its medalists were from or trained in Alberta. Canada was not a winter sport power in 1988; the nation's five medals in Calgary was its second best total at a Winter Olympics behind the seven it won at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. After 1988, Canada won {{an increasing number of}} medals at each successive Olympics, culminating in a 26-medal performance in 2010 that included a Winter Olympic record of 14 gold medals, <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the previous record holders Soviet Union (1976) and Norway (2002).|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Zito {{became one}} of the best {{pitchers}} in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team {{for the first time in}} his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher (14). Zito would become the AL's first 15-game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> his previous career high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

5|$|In the two-man {{bobsleigh}} competition, a tie {{meant that}} two gold medals were awarded, so no silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for {{second in the}} men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the number of silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati {{won the gold medal}} in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana.

5|$|On 11–12 August 2012, the Saturday and Sunday {{prior to}} {{the launch of the}} second series of Red or Black?, ITV {{suffered}} the worst weekend in its 57-year history due to BBC One's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics; it was beaten to second place in the primetime league tables by BBC Three {{for the first time ever}} and the only ITV programme on 11 August that was one of the channel's 30 most watched in the week 6–12 August 2012 was the ITV News at Ten.

5|$|Some mammals are omnivores {{and display}} {{varying degrees of}} carnivory and herbivory, {{generally}} leaning in favor of <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the other. Since plants and meat are digested differently, there is a preference for one over the other, as in bears where some species may be mostly carnivorous and others mostly herbivorous. They are grouped into three categories: mesocarnivory (50-70% meat), hypercarnivory (70% and greater of meat), and hypocarnivory (50% or less of meat). The dentition of hypocarnivores consists of dull, triangular carnassial teeth meant for grinding food. Hypercarnivores, however, have conical teeth and sharp carnassials meant for slashing, {{and in some cases}} strong jaws for bone-crushing, {{as in the case of}} hyenas, allowing them to consume bones; some extinct groups, notably the Machairodontinae, had saber-shaped canines.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E
