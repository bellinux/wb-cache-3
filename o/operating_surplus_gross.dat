40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main findings resulted from indicators analysis (gross value added, gross <b>operating</b> <b>surplus,</b> <b>gross</b> national income, etc.) which characterize {{the institutional sectors}} – the ones emphasizing the different behaviors and results between the competition and non-competition sectors (households and general government respectively). This analysis is very necessary, because the European Commission, through the specialized directorate - DGECFIN, has included in the forecast framework the indicators regarding incomes and expenditures of institutional sectors (compensation of employees, gross disposable income, gross saving) for member states. The macroeconomic forecast has not yet used this economic approach. The main inconvenience in estimating institutional sectors accounts forecast refers on one hand to {{the gap between the}} statistical and forecasting horizons, the statistical data regarding the institutional sectors are available only after a period of two years since the event has occurred (the data series for Romania end in 2004) and, on the other hand, the aggregates evaluation is only carried out in current prices, increasing thus the relativity of data series by using conventional deflators. Until now they are the first estimates referring to the compensation of employees and the gross disposable income. *This paper is partially based on the study “Overview of the economic results by institutional sectors”, NCP, 2007 institutional sector, households, gross value added, compensation of employees, gross <b>operating</b> <b>surplus,</b> <b>gross</b> national income...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: According to neoclassical theory, the {{relationship}} between the price, respectively of marginal cost and market structures, the methods for determining the performance of a firm or of an industry, deviate from the model of perfect competition. Assessing performance involves performing comparisons, reporting that their reference level can be a standard value, or a statistical value which can be a national-regional average, a homogeneous group, or an average value at a market level. Modern theories of the firm view that they may have other objectives than profit, which need {{to be taken into account}} when analyzing performance. Therefore between indicators for assessing the economic performance of an entity or a certain level of aggregation can not lack the profit or the gross <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> (<b>gross</b> profit), gross or net added value, turnover, as well as effort indicators like gross investment, tangible, intermediate consumption, cost of production, labor productivity, energy consumption, total productivity of production factors, etc [...] It will be presented the main economic and financial indicators of enterprises, by class size and ownership in Romania...|$|E

In other words, total US labour earnings are {{twice the size}} of total gross profit receipts directly generated by production. Since total wage costs are based on time-wages, it is simple math to understand that any measure of the net value added (gross labour compensation + gross profits) which Marx called the value product must necessarily show a strong positive correlation with the total labour hours worked.|$|R

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> and <b>gross</b> mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|R

50|$|Or, {{to put it}} a {{different}} way, the definition of <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> is dependent on the general definition of Gross Output from production. To obtain a measure of value added in production, all those income flows considered to be unrelated to production (mainly, property income and transfer income) are excluded from the valuation of Gross Output. Therefore, this is one reason why the <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> cited in national accounts is likely to be lower than real generic pre-tax profit income. An additional problem is the practice of shifting the declaration of profit income to another country where taxes are lower, by means of various financial manipulations. Again that leads to an understatement of domestic profits.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} trade balance between Japan and the US, Japan’s {{surpluses}} in two service sectors contributed to higher value-added <b>surpluses</b> than <b>gross</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Value-added surpluses in trade and transport (21) were significantly larger than <b>gross</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Moreover, {{the balance in}} other services (22) was positive in value-added terms while it was negative in gross terms. This reversal was due to indirect exports of other services through exports of manufactured goods. Six Japanese manufacturing sectors had larger value-added <b>surpluses</b> than <b>gross</b> ones. They were pulp, paper and printing (7), chemical products (8), petroleum and petroleum products (9), rubber products (10), non-metallic mineral products (11), and metals and metal products (12). Their surpluses were not large but not negligible either. Value added of these sectors, together {{with that of the}} service sectors, was embodied in Japan’s major export products such as industrial machinery (13), computer and electronic equipment (14), and motor vehicles (16).|$|R
