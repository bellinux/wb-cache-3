I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, {{and that there are}} Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E

Yagan warned, [...] "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three." [...] Moore reported the encounter but {{made no attempt to}} restrain Yagan. He later wrote, [...] "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be the captor... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey resurfaced in 1969 when Las Vegas {{businessman}} Kirk Kerkorian {{took control}} of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio for the first time, ousting Canadian liquor magnate Edgar M. Bronfman, who had gained control earlier that year. Aubrey's attorney Gregson E. Bautzer also represented Kerkorian, and Bautzer recommended Aubrey for the MGM post. [...] Aubrey, announced as MGM president on October 21, 1969, was Kerkorian's third choice after Herb Jaffe of United Artists and independent producer Mike Frankovich both declined the post, while producer Ray Stark was also considered. Aubrey replaced the fired Louis F. Polk Jr., who had been MGM president only since January 14, 1969. Aubrey was the studio's third president that year. [...] Polk told The New York Times, [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> leave a job unfinished," [...] and said he had started much-needed reforms at the studio, which suffered a $35 million loss in the fiscal year ending August 31, 1969.|$|E

500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E

From the start of August, Darwin began going there each day to [...] "dine at the Athenæum like a gentleman, or rather like a Lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat in that great drawing room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a duke. – I am full of admiration at the Athenæum; one meets so many people there, that <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> see. ...

All humans need to have equal rights, straight or gay. As long as <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> go to church and believe in God and that makes them a better, nicer person, that's great. Once hatred and superiority comes to play, I'm against religion." [...] She's stated that in Estonia, [...] "there really is no gay scene" [...] but that [...] "it's starting to emerge, and [...] trying to support it as much as [...] can." [...] In June 2011 and 2012, Kerli performed at pride festivals in Boston, Detroit, Nashville, and San Francisco. She is also a participant in the NOH8 Campaign.|$|E

2500|$|In common parlance, law means a {{rule that}} (unlike a rule of ethics) is {{enforceable}} through institutions. The study of law crosses the boundaries between {{the social sciences and}} humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a [...] "system of rules", as an [...] "interpretive concept" [...] to achieve justice, as an [...] "authority" [...] to mediate people's interests, and even as [...] "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction". However <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and discipline of the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about contract, tort, property law, labour law, company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun law derives from the late Old English lagu, meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word LEX.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Hebblethwaite was {{a strong}} man. He {{was a man of}} immense self-control. Yet in that moment the arteries of life seemed as though they had ceased to flow.
