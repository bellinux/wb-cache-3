5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

40|$|We {{hereafter}} {{make the}} case that a certain technostrategic knowledge regime exists that builds a good reputation to military interventions. This contributes to normalizing the latter within the apparels responsible for the execution of foreign policies, {{since the end of the}} cold war.

5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> {{electron}} acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is {{higher than that of}} the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number <b>of</b> <b>possible</b> values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm.
