40|$|An {{innovation}} {{is the process}} of making improvements by introducing new idea in the form of product or service. In recent years, successful societies are shifting their focus towards the realization and acceptance of these new ideas. Plug and Play business software platform is the first step to transform these ideas into reality. The study presented in this thesis introduced that a new business idea contains specific business role and consists of a set of capabilities or needs and any one of them. Plug and play business software platform mainly consists of three major business processes that are required to run this platform those are; business match making process, negotiating process and collaboration process. This study analyzes the process of business match making in detail and introduce an ontology based business match making process which will find new businesses in a hierarchical fashion based on their specific business roles. Match making ontology consists of three processes i. e. information collection process which is used to collect and register information, extraction process which is an optional process to extract set of capabilities and needs if actor/innovator is unable to define its business capabilities and needs in information collection process and finally finding and ranking process which will find a set of potential collaborators and then will rank that set based on ranking parameters collected in information collection process from actor/innovator. This study also presents a technological model which will provide foundation to develop plug and play business software platform. This model identifies business processes of the platform and presents each business process as a separate loosely coupled software module. This model divides the platform into two layers; the upper layer is called PnP layer and consists of PnP Client Service, PnP Community Service, Finding and Ranking Service, Negotiating Service and Collaboration Service; lower layer is called kernel layer and consists of Security <b>management</b> <b>Service,</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>management</b> <b>Services</b> and Communication Service.

30|$|This study proposes an {{efficient}} service delivery system using a blueprinting approach to service innovation in private educational institutions. This case study presents a flow chart based on administration blueprinting {{of a private}} preparatory school for college entrance examination, located in South Korea, to streamline process criteria based on administrative procedures for students and their parents. The results of the case study provide useful planning information for successful implementation of service blueprinting in private educational institutions. The study results are expected to help improve customer encounters as the service provider can employ effective processes. The study also sheds light on new <b>operational</b> <b>management</b> strategies for <b>service</b> innovation. By continuously improving information sharing, service encounters are expected to enhance customer satisfaction. The blueprinting technique can streamline the sequence of customer activities in a service process to meet customer expectations and needs. Thus, the approach could help researchers and administrators as certain how they might implement the system to correct failure points to successfully resolve difficulties.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{considers the}} activity based network of routines {{performed by the}} integrated servicing crews at the airport. The known algorithms for critical path claiming suppose that the activity duration is given {{and the beginning of}} any activity is determined. However, the beginning of the activity also depends on the presence of the necessary resources for the given period of time. The formal statement of the problem is described. For the solution of the problem the well-known algorithm for constructing the tree of the shortest paths of the network graph is used. Herewith we suppose, that activity durations are known and resources are sufficient in order to start each activity at the right time. Further, this algorithm is modified inorder to take into account available resources. The special two-dimensional matrix with rows showing resource units andcolumns denoting the equally separated time intervals is used to demonstrate the resources state. The numerical method is proposed for solving the optimization problem. The method is implemented using the Mathcad computing environment and validated by specific examples. The method is implemented as a complex automated solution for <b>operational</b> <b>management</b> of airport <b>services</b> in the critical situations...|$|R
40|$|To have a cost–efficient {{distribution}} channel {{is of great}} importance for any commercial corporation to run business effectively, whether it is conducted globally or in certain regions. In the process of distribution, both physical transportation and warehousing operations are critical, which need to mesh with other logistical operations. This thesis deals with the operative distribution issue at MODUL Service AB, a subsidiary company of IKEA Group. Following the rapid expansion in the Far East, MODUL Service AB has encountered a number of distributing problems with the symptoms of high transport cost and poor controllability of the shipment. In {{order to be able}} to sustain the competitive advantage, the <b>operational</b> <b>management</b> of MODUL <b>Service</b> AB has decided to improve their distribution performance in the Far East from a logistics perspective. The improvement could be achieved through streamlining the {{distribution channel}} in China. Therefore, the thesis will discuss the issues regarding distribution performance and its possible improvement in China.

40|$|With {{the onset}} of new {{satellite}} radar constellations (e. g. Sentinel- 1) and advances in computational science (e. g. grid computing) enabling the supply and processing of multi-mission satellite data at a temporal frequency that is compatible with real-time flood forecasting requirements, this study presents a new concept for the sequential assimilation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) -derived water stages into coupled hydrologic-hydraulic models. The proposed methodology consists of adjusting storages and fluxes simulated by a coupled hydrologic-hydraulic model using a Particle Filter-based data assimilation scheme. Synthetic observations of water levels, representing satellite measurements, are assimilated into the coupled model in order to investigate {{the performance of the}} proposed assimilation scheme as a function of both accuracy and frequency of water level observations. The use of the Particle Filter provides flexibility regarding the form of the probability densities of both model simulations and remote sensing observations. We illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology using a twin experiment over a widely studied river reach located in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The study demonstrates that the Particle Filter algorithm leads to significant uncertainty reduction of water level and discharge at the time step of assimilation. However, updating the storages of the model only improves the model forecast over a very short time horizon. A more effective way of updating thus consists in adjusting both states and inputs. The proposed methodology, which consists in updating the biased forcing of the hydraulic model using information on model errors that is inferred from satellite observations, enables persistent model improvement. The present schedule of satellite radar missions is such that it is likely that there will be continuity for SAR-based <b>operational</b> water <b>management</b> <b>services.</b> This research contributes to evolve reactive flood management into systematic or quasi-systematic SAR-based flood monitoring services...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there are}} some kinds of {{wireless}} networks (e.g., LTE) that use a licensed frequency band in 5 G networks, a wireless link in EDHs may not always have a dedicated bandwidth and, as a result, the neighboring node transmissions may also compete for the same bandwidth. Thus, a transmission in one wireless link interferes with transmissions in neighboring links. Instability is an intrinsic problem caused by interference that {{has an effect on}} link quality in any wireless network. Moreover, the neighboring links with a high traffic load cause interference (i.e., self-interference) and increase the congestion in the wireless links [13]. In this context, the routing and spectrum <b>management</b> <b>operational</b> <b>services</b> must also be aware of the link quality by taking into account the interference and wireless channel load between the neighboring nodes and thus being able to achieve a resilient and scalable routing decision and spectrum selection, respectively. In view of this, WiSEED will employ most precise cross-layer measurements [28] in order to estimate the link quality, such as SINR and channel busy time.|$|R
