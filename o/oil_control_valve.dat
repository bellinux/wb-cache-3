50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses an <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> which controls oil flow to a unique camshaft sprocket which contains a phasing device, which depending on {{the operation of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> either advances or retards camshaft timing.|$|E
50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the sight glasses. Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> Sight glasses are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|E

The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the valve rocker arm switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> through a two-feed stationary hydraulic lash adjuster, allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included oil buffered mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal oil piping vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi. There were six <b>oil</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> on the system, including a lube <b>oil</b> pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> one flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for the <b>oil</b> system. Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>control</b> sensing lines were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system. These changes along with pipe support modifications and changes to the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sensing lines were successful at reducing the pipe pulsations and vibration response to acceptable levels...|$|R
50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are <b>oil</b> discharge <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> water-discharge <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> (three-phase operation), drain valves, block valves, pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
30|$|The suction end of {{the return}} piping {{arrangement}} was connected to an air manifold with three automated <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would close and another <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO 2 was consumed by the algae, additional CO 2 was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty <b>control</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> with load velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional load <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to achieve load velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> achieve load velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the load velocity control ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> a fast opening feature. An actual load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, the {{guidelines}} {{given in the}} literature on the selection of chilled water flow <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> for air-handling equipment were reviewed and the proper way of selecting this type of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> was presented. Complementary to that paper, this paper attempts to answer some questions related to the selection and operation of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in air-conditioning systems comprising multiple chillers and chilled water pumps. Explanations are given on the limits imposed on the cooling outputs of air-handling units when they are equipped with three-way <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and are fed with chilled water from a central plant comprising multiple chillers and pumps while some of the chillers and pumps have been shutdown under part-load conditions. The Interactions between the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and the chilled water pumps, as they are cycled on and off, in a single-loop and a two-loop pumping system are analysed. The conclusions Include that the differential pressure bypass <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> in a single-loop pumping system should be sized for a flow handling capacity significantly greater than the flow rate of one chiller. For minimising the disturbances to the temperature control function of air-conditioning systems, <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> with linear Inherent characteristics should be used for differential pressure bypass control. Furthermore, for a two-loop pumping system, both the chiller on and off settings for a conventional de-coupler bypass control system should be based on surplus flow rates, and the on/off control over the secondary-loop pumps should avoid requiring each pump to handle a flow rate significantly greater than its rated flow rate.
