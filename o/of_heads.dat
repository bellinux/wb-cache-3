5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was {{seconded}} to the Foreign Service.

He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See. In this capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S.

He suffered with concussion during the match after a clash <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> with Dion Dublin. He failed to break into the first team on a regular basis as Denis Irwin, Phil Neville and Mikaël Silvestre were all preferred ahead of him at left-back.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 Formby Sr {{allowed his}} son to appear on screen, taking the lead in By the Shortest <b>of</b> <b>Heads,</b> a thriller {{directed}} by Bert Haldane in which Formby played a stable boy who outwits a gang of villains and wins a £10,000 prize when he comes first in a horse race. The film is now considered lost, with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940. Later in 1915, and with {{the closure of the}} English racing season because of the First World War, Formby moved to Ireland where he continued as a jockey until November 1918. Later that month he returned to England and raced for Lord Derby at his Newmarket stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1213 Norreis was {{appointed}} the prior of Penwortham Priory, a dependent priory of Evesham, partly to compensate {{him for the}} loss of the abbacy and partly to keep him from abandoning monastic life entirely. Norreis was deposed five months later owing to his continued bad morals and behaviour and again went to Rome in a bid to be restored to office. On this occasion he was unable to secure his reinstatement, but in 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham through the influence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio. Norries died on 16 July or 19 July, but there is disagreement over the year of his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he died in 1223, but the editors <b>of</b> <b>Heads</b> of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940–1216 state he died in either 1224 or 1225. He was buried at Penwortham.|$|E
5|$|Pablo {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Championship (second-tier) club Birmingham City in August 2011, {{at the end}} of the summer transfer window. The fee was undisclosed. He made his debut for the club in a 3–1 home defeat to Braga in the group stage of the Europa League. Away to Club Brugge in the same competition, he was knocked unconscious in a clash <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> with Joseph Akpala for which he received lengthy treatment; in the tenth minute of the resultant stoppage time, Chris Wood scored a winning goal for Birmingham. Pablo had replaced the injured Curtis Davies in the starting eleven, but the concussion sustained at Brugge gave Davies time to regain fitness and his undisputed starting place alongside Steven Caldwell in central defence. After Caldwell's season ended early through injury, Pablo returned to the team for the last few games, including the play-off semi-final defeat, and finished the 62-game season with 17 starts, of which only 7 came in the league.|$|E
