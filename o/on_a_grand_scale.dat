5|$|Speer {{joined the}} Nazi Party in 1931, {{launching}} {{himself on a}} political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he {{became a member of}} Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg where Party rallies were held. Speer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries {{were marked by}} the {{establishment}} of tropical botanical gardens {{as a tool of}} colonial expansion (for trade and commerce and, secondarily, science) mainly by the British and Dutch, in India, South-east Asia and the Caribbean. This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks's botanical collections during Captain James Cook's circumnavigations of the planet and his explorations of Oceania, which formed the last phase of plant introduction <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E

60|$|It {{is due to}} Mr Tigg to {{say that}} he had really risen with his opportunities; and, peculating <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scale,</b> he had become <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> man altogether.|$|R
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|After a slow start, {{in early}} 1942, Cascade {{began to take}} effect. As early as May, Axis {{intelligence}} began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions {{and by the end}} of the year the Germans had accepted many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale</b> was a realistic strategy.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{similar pattern}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scale</b> {{was seen in}} Barnet where Henry Tubbs built Nether Court in 1883. This was {{ultimately}} to become the clubhouse of Finchley Golf Club in 1929 after his death.|$|R

5|$|The third Marquess of Bute, again called John, {{inherited}} {{the title and}} castle in 1848. He was then {{less than a year}} old, and as he grew up he came to despise the existing castle, believing that it represented a mediocre, half-hearted example of the Gothic style. Bute engaged the architect William Burges, to undertake the remodelling of the castle. The two shared a passion in medieval Gothic Revivalism and this, combined with Bute's huge financial resources, enabled Burges to rebuild the property <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale.</b> Burges brought with him almost of all of the team that had supported him on earlier projects, including John Starling Chapple, William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale. Burges's contribution, in particular his research into the history of the castle and his architectural imagination, was critical to the transformation.|$|E
5|$|When {{this was}} {{effected}} in 1090, John {{became the first}} Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, {{it was felt that}} a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and {{is characterized by the}} use of locally available natural materials like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers. Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830. Some of the altars are covered in gold. Often the walls of the mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives. In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect. The {{construction of}} the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade. The only other example where stone was used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale</b> is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.|$|E
50|$|This {{geographic}} isolation {{is a common}} thread in evolution. It is {{a key factor in}} the evolution of species <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scale.</b> Thus, the events causing {{geographic isolation}} are unmistakable in their significance as evolutionary mechanisms.|$|R

25|$|Many people remain sceptical about Lourdes and its {{supposed}} healing power, {{arguing that}} any improvement {{offered by the}} shrine {{is no more than}} the placebo effect, and that the ceremonies and processions are no better than faith-healing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jock {{was partly}} {{driven by the}} guilt of his family background, {{but also by the}} {{conviction}} that every business has a responsibility towards its workers; and that profit alone should not be the guiding principle of society.

25|$|From {{its very}} local, Tennessee origins in 1847, Cumberland...emerged as a premier law {{school with a}} {{national}} status.

50|$|After the Russo-Crimean War (1571), {{which saw}} the monastery reduced to ashes, it was {{restored}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scale.</b> The five-domed Cathedral of the Conception dates from that building campaign, financed by Ivan the Terrible.

25|$|St German's Priory {{was built}} over a Saxon {{building}} {{which was the}} cathedral of the Bishops of Cornwall. The monastery was reorganised by the Bishop of Exeter between 1161 and 1184 as an Augustinian priory and the new church was built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scale,</b> with two western towers and a nave of 102ft.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1915, the German {{authorities}} put {{in place}} a system of camps, nearly three hundred in all, and did not hesitate to resort to denutrition, punishments and psychological mobbing; incarceration was also combined with methodical exploitation of the prisoners.

25|$|The Duke {{commissioned}} Paley again, {{together with}} Hubert Austin, (the firm was {{then known as}} Paley and Austin) to rebuild the wing. This they did on the same footprint, but <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scale,</b> adding two towers, the whole being in Elizabethan Revival style. The estimated cost of this was about £38,000 (£ as of 2014).|$|R
