40|$|We {{present a}} method of test {{generation}} for acyclic sequential circuits with <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> A complete (100 % fault efficiency) test sequence for an acyclic sequential circuit {{can be obtained by}} applying a combinational test generator to all the maximal time-expansion models (TEMs) of the circuit. We propose a class of acyclic sequential circuits for which the number of maximal TEMs is one, i. e, the maximum TEM exists. For a circuit in the class, test generation can be performed by using only the maximum TEM. The proposed class of sequential circuits with the maximum TEM properly includes several known classes of acyclic sequential circuits such as balanced structures and acyclic sequential circuits without <b>hold</b> <b>registers</b> for which test generation can be also performed by using a combinational test generator. Therefore, in general, the hardware overhead for partial scan based on the proposed structure is smaller than that based on balanced or acyclic sequential structure without <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{universal}} {{serial bus}} (USB) is a Full duplex serial bus interface. USB devices receive the data from Transmitter Macro cell interface: a transmitter and a receiver section both of which uses 2 lines D+ and D- for transmission and reception. There are three functional blocks present in USB controller: Serial Interface Engine (SIE), UTMI and Device Specific Logic (DSL). The transmit <b>hold</b> <b>register</b> <b>holds</b> the data received from SIE and is converted to serial data and is send to transmit shift register. This serial data is added to some extra bits known as bit stuffing in order for clock synchronization and Manchester encoding. Then the encoded data is sent on to the serial bus. When the data is received on the serial bus, it is decoded, bit unstuffed and is sent to receive shift register. After the shift register is full, the Data is sent to receive <b>hold</b> <b>register.</b> The same can be designed using VHDL code and synthesize...|$|R
