5000|$|The {{reaction}} shows recurring periodic changes, both gradual and sudden, {{which are}} visible: slow {{changes in the}} intensity of colour, interrupted by abrupt changes in hue. This demonstrates that a complex combination of slow and fast reactions are taking place simultaneously. For example, following the iodide ion concentration with a silver/silver iodide electrode (see Videos) shows sudden dramatic swings of several orders of magnitude separated by slower variations. This is shown by the <b>oscillogram</b> above.Oscillations persist {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Higher temperatures make everything happen faster, with some qualitative change observable (see Effect of temperature).Stirring the solution throughout the reaction is helpful for sharp colour changes, otherwise spatial variations may develop (see Videos).Bubbles of free oxygen are evolved throughout, and in most cases, the final state is rich in free iodine ...|$|E

5000|$|To {{adjust the}} {{modulation}} index, an input of maximum level CVS (1000 mV) {{is applied to}} the modulator. The modulated RF signal is then applied to a professional TV receiver [...] The receiver has a facility to switch off RF for a short interval in each consecutive line. So during this interval, modulation ratio is effectively 0%. The interruption on all lines in a frame is observed as a vertical white bar on a visual monitor. This bar is named as 0 reference pulse (or simply 0 pulse). The <b>oscillogram</b> of the 0 pulse is a pulse with a level more than the maximum level of the CVS. Taking the level difference between the sycn tip and the 0 pulse as % 100, the maximum CVS should be 10% or 12.5%. The adjustment of the modulation index is simply the level adjustment of the modulating signal (CVS) at the input of the modulator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} {{comprehensive}} description of three flavor neutrino oscillations inside the Earth {{in terms of}} neutrino <b>oscillograms</b> in {{the whole range of}} nadir angles and for energies above 0. 1 GeV. The effects of the 1 - 2 mass splitting and mixing as well the interference of the 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 modes of oscillations are quantified. The 1 - 2 mass splitting and mixing lead to the appearance, apart from the resonance MSW peaks, of the parametric resonance peak for core-crossing trajectories at Eν ∼ 0. 2 GeV. We show that the interference effects, in particular CP violation, have a domain structure with borders determined by the solar and atmospheric magic lines and the lines of the interference phase condition. The dependence of the <b>oscillograms</b> on the Dirac CP-violating phase is studied.
