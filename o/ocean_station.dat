5|$|A weather ship, or <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

25|$|The Taney {{served on}} <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> November from 7 to 28 January 18 February to 10 March 21 April to 12 May and 27 October to 17 November 1968. Her final {{assignment}} to <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> November was from 19 January to 9 February 1969. She was then ordered for duty with Coast Guard Squadron Three which was supporting the Navy's Operation Market Time patrols {{off the coast}} of Vietnam. There Taney served a 10-month tour of duty, providing naval gunfire support and preventing enemy infiltration along the coastal routes used by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1972 Taney was shifted back to {{the east}} coast and was homeported at Norfolk. From 13 to 22 October 1972 she served on <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Hotel. From 28 October to 17 November 1972 she served on <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Delta. From 26 January to 15 February and 17 April to 7 May 1973 she served on <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Bravo. As the ocean {{stations}} were decommissioned during the early 1970s due to advances in radar and electronic navigation, Taney was assigned exclusively to the only station still operational: <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Hotel off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. Fitted with a special storm-tracking antenna housed in a distinctive bulbous dome fitted atop her pilot house, Taney deployed seven times yearly, conducting 21 deployments [...] off the coast. This last <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> had been established to track storms threatening the middle states {{on the east coast}} which had often struck without warning. Eventually, the use of more sophisticated storm-tracking satellites and radars rendered this station obsolete. Hence, <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Hotel was closed down in 1977 and the Taney gained the distinction of being the last Coast Guard cutter to serve on an <b>ocean</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{shifting}} back to {{the west}} coast, Taney was based at Alameda, California until February 1972. Her primary post-war duty was serving as an <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> weather ship. The weather patrols (later termed [...] "ocean station patrols") consisted of sailing for three weeks on assigned stations in the Pacific, and each cutter assigned performed four or five such patrols each year. Their primary task was to report meteorological information, which was used in weather forecasts for the burgeoning trans-Pacific commercial air traffic {{as well as for}} surface vessels. The <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> vessels also provided communications and navigation assistance and were always standing by for search and rescue emergencies. She also conducted dedicated law enforcement and search and rescue patrols, or stood on search and rescue standby, when she was not on <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> duty.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Taney {{undertook}} a 90-day [...] "Double VICTOR Cruise". She departed Alameda on 26 August {{and arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 1 September, where she refueled before steaming to Honolulu, mooring at Berth 8. She departed Honolulu on 3 September en route <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Victor via Midway Island, arriving at the latter on 6 September, departing the same day. On 8 September 1966 Taney crossed the 180th meridian and then arrived at <b>Ocean</b> <b>Station</b> Victor on 11 September, relieving USCGC Chautauqua (WHEC-41). She served on Victor until relieved by USCGC Winnebago (WHEC-40) on 1 October, then steamed towards Yokosuka, Japan. Here the crew enjoyed liberty before again {{heading back to the}} <b>ocean</b> <b>station.</b> She arrived at Victor on 22 October, relieving Winnebago. On 4 November Typhoon Marie passed close aboard Taney, with winds gusting close to 70 knots (130km/h), but she weathered the storm without damage. On 12 November 1966 Taney was relieved again by Winnebago and she then steamed to Midway Island to refuel before heading back to Alameda, arriving there on 20 November.|$|E

50|$|Only {{when war}} {{developments}} {{increased demand for}} these large cutters elsewhere were they replaced by other, smaller craft {{taken over by the}} Coast Guard for such duties as weather patrol. By {{the end of the war}} there were 11 Coast Guard <b>ocean</b> <b>stations</b> in the Atlantic, acting as plane guards and radio beacons as well as weather reporters.|$|R
5000|$|In 1946, the U.S. Navy {{transferred}} Wachapreague to the United States Coast Guard, which commissioned {{her as the}} Coast Guard cutter [...] Reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-386 in 1966, McCulloch {{served for}} nearly 26 years, on patrol in <b>ocean</b> <b>stations</b> in the North Atlantic Ocean, reporting weather data and engaging in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement activities.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} air traffic {{after the war and}} heavier commercial shipping traffic the Ebasco Study recommended that the Coast Guard retain the responsibilities for LORAN stations and ocean stations that had been assumed during the war. The chains of LORAN stations maintained by the Coast Guard were modernized and the utilized by both aircraft and ships for navigation purposes. The <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> program provided up-to-date weather information and search and rescue for both aircraft and ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The initial attempt by the Coast Guard to operate enough stations to satisfy the demands of the airlines and shipping industry failed because of manpower limitations required in the Coast Guard budgets. The situation changed with the [...] rescue of the Bermuda Sky Queen, in September 1947. The Queen was a flying boat that was caught in gale-force winds that caused her to increase fuel consumption and as a result she could not reach her destination. The captain of the aircraft turned around and flew to the Bibb and successfully landed near the cutter. After a rescue lasting for several hours, all aboard the Queen were rescued without injury and Bibb was received in Boston to a hero's welcome. This demonstrated to Congress that the <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> program was valuable to the fledgling trans-oceanic airline industry and funds were added to the Coast Guard budget to acquire the cutters and manpower needed to operate the program. At Farley's request, the Navy loaned a total of eighteen moth-balled [...] Cascoclass seaplane tenders that would serve as <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> cutters as well as two [...] cargo ships for supply of LORAN stations. The Army supplied three FS-class cargo ships for the same purpose. Farley was instrumental in establishing and maintaining both post-war plans for LORAN and ocean stations. Development of helicopters as a rescue vehicle continued during Farley's term as Commandant with the establishment of the Rotary Wing Development Unit at Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{responsibilities}} that Roland undertook as Commandant was to implement the recommendations of a staff report on U.S. Coast Guard roles and missions that was ordered by C. Douglas Dillon, Secretary of the Treasury. The implementation of the study required many changes in assets and personnel during his tenure as Commandant. As international air traffic increased during the 1950s and 1960s, the requirement for <b>ocean</b> <b>station</b> cutters and more efficient operation of AMVER required increases in personnel and spurred the service to invest in better cutters and aircraft {{that could be used}} in search and rescue work. The U.S. Coast Guard acquired additional responsibilities in March 1963 with an agreement with the Navy relating to icebreaking duties in Arctic and Antarctic research missions. In May 1965 the U.S. Coast Guard acquired the Navy's five icebreakers, but the requirements for additional personnel recruiting to man the icebreakers delayed the actual transfer of the ships. The first icebreaker could not be manned until July and the last was not transferred until November 1966. On 9 July 1963, Roland received the Legion of Merit from Secretary Dillon in recognition of his outstanding record in maintaining a military readiness posture [...] "unparalleled in the peacetime history of the Coast Guard". During Roland's tour as Commandant the U.S. Coast Guard plan for modernization of its fleet of medium and high endurance cutters was realized with the launching {{of the first}} acquisition of a major cutter since World War II. The medium endurance cutter [...] was commissioned 20 June 1964.|$|E
