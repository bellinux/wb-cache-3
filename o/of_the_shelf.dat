5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian continental shelf. Volcanoes in the area are formed because of oceanic crusts and the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E

25|$|On {{their next}} adventure, Bert {{introduces}} {{the children to}} his friends the chimney sweeps ("Step in Time"). The sweeps' dance eventually enters the house, causing chaos. As the sweeps quickly exit, George receives a telegram from the bank requesting his presence there. George assumes that it is to seal his fate and decides it's time to sell the family heirloom. However, the vase is shattered accidentally by Mrs. Brill, who goes into a despairing shock since she had been cleaning it from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> When she is being led away for comfort, George goes to clean the broken pile himself, to find it reveal a collection of gingerbread stars from his childhood. This leads to a brief moment of reflection for George ("A Man Has Dreams/ A Spoonful of Sugar (Reprise)"). After shaking hands with Bert, George leaves to meet the Chairman of the Bank.|$|E
500|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} is less populous. It is found in {{temperate}} and tropical waters of the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its population overlaps slightly with the long-finned pilot whale in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. About 150,000 individuals {{are found in the}} eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. More than 30,000 animals are estimated in the western Pacific, off the coast of Japan. Pilot whales are generally nomadic, but some populations stay year-round in places such as Hawaii and parts of California. They prefer the waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break and slope. [...] Once commonly seen off of Southern California, {{short-finned pilot whale}}s disappeared from the area after a strong El Niño year in the early 1980s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [...] In October 2014, crew and passengers on several boats spotted a pod of 50–200 off Dana Point, California.|$|E

500|$|The skull roof (formed by {{the frontal}} and parietal bones) was broad {{and formed a}} [...] "shelf", which {{overhung}} the short supratemporal fenestrae at the top rear of the skull. The jaw articulated far behind the occipital condyle (where the neck {{is attached to the}} skull) compared to other theropods. The condyle was broad and low, and had pneumatic cavities. Giganotosaurus did not have a sagittal crest {{on the top of the}} skull, and the jaw muscles did not extend onto the skull roof, unlike in most other theropods (due to the shelf over the supratemporal fenestrae). These muscles would instead have been attached to the lower side surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> The neck muscles that elevated the head would have attached to the prominent supraoccipital bones on the top of the skull, which functioned like the nuchal crest of tyrannosaurs.

500|$|In 2003, Williamson and Carr {{published}} a hypothetical growth series of S. validum, showing Ornatotholus as the juvenile stage. They suggested that juveniles {{were characterized by}} a flat, thickened frontoparietal roof, with larger supratemporal fenestrae, and studded with closely spaced tubercles and nodes. The parietosquamosal shelf was not reduced in size, and the frontoparietal suture was open. Sub-adults had mound-like domes, with the back part of the parietal and skull-roof being flat. The supratemporal fenestrae showed asymmetry in size, and {{the closure of the}} frontoparietal suture was variable. The nodes were stretched or almost obliterated as the dome expanded during growth, with a tesserated surface remaining. The pattern was often obliterated at the highest point (apex) of the dome, the area where maximum expansion occurred. The tubercles on the skull were stretched in different directions, and those at the margin of the parietosquamosal shelf may have been hypertrophied (enlarged) tubercles. The back and sides of sub-adult and adult skulls were ornamented by less modified tubercles. Before being incorporated into the enlarging dome, the skull bones expanded, resulting in junctions between these bones. The adult dome was broad and convex, and incorporated most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> which was reduced in size and overhung the occiput as a thick [...] "lip". The supratempooral fenestrae were closed, but the suture between the frontoparietal and connected skull bones was not always closed in adults and subadults.|$|E
2500|$|On December 24, a New York Public Library clerk using a {{phone booth}} dropped a coin.

50|$|In the Tomy version, the two armies {{are called}} <b>the</b> Impalers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clannic <b>Shelf</b> and <b>the</b> Doomlords <b>of</b> Gulch. <b>The</b> Impalers inhabit <b>the</b> Clannic <b>Shelf,</b> a large {{floating}} rock island 500 metres above <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> Otherworld. <b>The</b> <b>shelf</b> has a gravitational {{effect on the}} Doomlords, causing {{them to have a}} shorter, squatter frame than the Impalers.|$|R
2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this design {{is that it}} may require the more intense use of a toilet brush to remove bits of feces that may have left marks on the shelf. Additionally, this design presents the {{disadvantage of}} creating a strong lingering odor since the feces is not submerged in water immediately after excretion. Similar designs are found in some early toilets in the US, one particular brand being labeled the [...] "Grand Niagara", as the flushing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> created a waterfall effect into the drain chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{its great}} age, the Larsen B was clearly in trouble {{at the time}} of the collapse. With warm {{currents}} eating away the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> it had become a [...] "hotspot of global warming". It broke in a time of three weeks or less, with a factor in this fast break-up being the powerful effects of water; ponds of meltwater formed on the surface during the near 24 hours of daylight in the summertime, then the water flowed down into cracks and, acting like a multitude of wedges, levered the shelf apart. Other likely factors in the break-up were the higher ocean temperatures and the decline of the ice of the peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|The former Larsen A region, {{which was}} the {{farthest}} north and was just outside the Antarctic Circle, had previously broken up [...] {{in the middle of}} the present interglacial and reformed only about 4,000 years ago. The former Larsen B, by contrast, had been stable for at least 10,000 years. The ice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> is renewed on a much shorter time-scale and the maximal ice age on the current shelf dates from only two hundred years ago. The speed of Crane Glacier increased threefold after the collapse of the Larsen B, likely due to the removal of a buttressing effect of the ice shelf. Data collected in 2007 by an international team of investigators through satellite-based radar measurements suggests that the overall ice-sheet mass balance in Antarctica is increasingly negative.|$|E

2500|$|... "Sell by date" [...] {{is a less}} {{ambiguous}} term for what {{is often referred to}} as an [...] "expiration date". Most food is still edible after the expiration date. A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. This is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.|$|E
2500|$|Van der Hamen's {{still lifes}} are painted {{in a style}} {{markedly}} Flemish but they reflect the strong influence of those painted {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century in Toledo by Juan Sánchez Cotán, in which fruits and vegetables are often shown suspended [...] from a window frame or arrange along a ledge. Van der Hamen adapted Sánchez Cotán compositional style to the conditions of cosmopolitan life in Madrid, using more elaborate objects and foods compositions and objects ranging elaborate confessions, imported Venetian crystals and ceramic vessels along a simple shelf. The objects are silhouetted against a dark background and caught in a powerful light. Their regular, zigzag arrangements and the strong shadows falling on the shelf result in a placid sense of space that is heightened by the impression given by the wafers extending beyond the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> towards the viewer.|$|E
