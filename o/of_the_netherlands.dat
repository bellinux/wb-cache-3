5|$|Following {{the death}} of their aunt Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Emperor Charles V, to assume the {{governance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> and guardianship over their nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark.

Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King of France. Although she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, as well as in securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire.
