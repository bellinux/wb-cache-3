40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} topology optimization {{as a tool for}} the design of shock isolator, which is based on cone-type disc spring for prescribed load-displacement functions. The objective function evaluates load-displacement relationship based on the prescribed softening load-displacement function, which improve shock isolation capability. The geometrically nonlinear behavior of the shock isolator is modeled using total Lagrangian finite element formulation. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivity in topology optimization, adjoint variable method is employed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|Gyroscopic {{stabilization}} {{can be used}} {{to maintain}} an otherwise unstable body in an upright position. Devices equipped with gyroscopes can balance upon a small area or point without falling over when the gyroscopic stabilizing force is greater than a rotational force or moment from an <b>out-of-balance</b> <b>load</b> that causes the device to tip. A new concept for a gyroscopically stabilized platform has been proposed {{in the form of a}} schematic diagram. The proposed system comprises of four interconnected gyroscopes that react to the tipping of an inherently unstable external body. The purpose of this research is to evolve a design for, and establish the feasibility of building the proposed stable platform using available materials and technology. If feasible, the gyroscopically stabilized platform will be made at the most practical and economic size. Louis Brennan developed a 37 tonne monorail that was maintained in the upright position with two 3 tonne counter rotating gyroscopes. The Brennan monorail is analysed to better understand the behaviour of a similar coupled gyroscopic stabilization system. The reactions between the components that maintain the monorail in the stable position are studied and comparisons are made between the proposed stable platform and the Brennan system. A mathematical analysis of the proposed system is presented. The equations of motion for the system are derived using the Lagrangian Formalism. The characteristic equation of the system is then determined and from this a set of stability conditions imposed on the design of the physical parameters of the stable platform. The general solutions to the equations of motion are then derived. Expressions that model the behaviour of two of the variables that describe the motion of the stable platform are determined. A systematic approach is adopted for establishing a new concept for the proposed system. Testing of the initial stable platform prototype (Prototype A) showed the system did not behave as intended. The platform was optimised further and this resulted in a second prototype, Prototype B. Prototype B exhibiting the desired oscillatory motion about the vertical of the platform. Predictions made using the mathematical model are compared with empirical results. The mathematical model was found to be an accurate method for predicting the response of the stable platform...|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} gravity is even more {{critical}} for helicopters {{than it is for}} fixed-wing aircraft (weight issues remain the same). As with fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter may be properly loaded for takeoff, but near {{the end of a long}} flight when the fuel tanks are almost empty, the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or longitudinally. For helicopters with a single main rotor, the CG is usually close to the main rotor mast. Improper balance of a helicopter’s load can result in serious control problems. In addition to making a helicopter difficult to control, an <b>out-of-balance</b> <b>loading</b> condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.|$|R
25|$|Aerodynamic balance {{for control}} {{surfaces}} was by geared tab on the IIIa and b, but on IIId, f, and g the outer flap had a 20% Frise nose which also countered adverse yaw: <b>out-of-balance</b> aerodynamic <b>loads</b> on the elevators were trimmed by a rubber bungee trimmer with the trim datum {{set by the}} pilot.|$|R
40|$|Auto-{{balancing}} or {{active control}} balancing can be efficient solutions for high speed rotors with changing <b>out-of-balance</b> <b>loads</b> like washing machines in spin-drying mode. In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high spin-drying speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices. Analytical and multi-body models are first made for understanding the mechanisms, highlighting the driving parameters and drawing the final design of a first prototype which is inserted in a washing machine drum. Different tests are carried out for different initial unbalances and different rotation speeds: the residual unbalance is measured {{by means of a}} set of accelerometers mounted on the tub, while the mobile masses behaviour is observed by means of a large aperture swift camera. The test results highlight the auto-balancer high efficiency but also the sensitivity to geometrical defects which should be corrected in the next systems. According the theory, the balancing is efficient when the rotation frequency is significantly greater than the hanging frequencies. The multi-body model relevance is also demonstrated. A washer-dryer prototype including an auto-balancer second prototype and two other innovations, regarding thermal exchange efficiency and drum insulation, will be tested in operating conditions...|$|R
