5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass <b>on.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although this airport {{does not}} support direct {{commercial}} flights, it does provide three daily charter flights and general aviation services from Monday to Friday to other selected destinations, including the Pangborn Memorial Airport, by charter airlines such as Ameriflight and Empire Airlines. For the 12-month period ending on May30, 2012, the airport garnered 23,750aircraft movements, 1,000of which were for cargo use {{with an average of}} 63per day for all of the movements, making it the second busiest airport in the Okanogan County after Anderson Field, which gained 25,000aircraft operations approximately. Of these aircraft movements, 3,600of them were used for air taxi purposes, while 5,500aircraft used it for local general aviation services; the aircraft operation count for itinerant general aviation was 14,500. Meanwhile, there were 150military aircraft operations, meaning that based <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> statistics, the following data was calculated: 61percent used it for itinerant general aviation, while 23percent used it for local general aviation; 15percent used it for air taxi services and 1percent for military purposes.|$|E
25|$|Geologists have {{attempted}} to date the Cardenas Basalt for many years. On the basis of other geologic criteria, geologists {{have found that the}} dates, which range from 1,000 to 700 million years ago, obtained for the age of the Cardenas Basalt and upper age of the Unkar Group, were too young, and something was clearly perturbing the dating systematics. The current interpretation is that the deposition of the overlying Chuar Group, in a marine setting, disrupted the potassium-argon (K-Ar) radiometric system. Apparently, fluids associated with the deposition of the Chuar Group have altered the older Cardenas Basalt, partially degraded the minerals, and therefore producing a disruption in the K-Ar systematics. Using newer dating techniques and approaches not available to earlier geologists, the Cardenas Basalt and intrusive sills have been re-dated. New data acquired using newer dating techniques and approaches, indicate that the Cardenas Basalt erupted about 1,104 million years ago. This date marks the end of the deposition of the Unkar Group. These radiometric dates are corroborated by the radiometric dating of detrial micas and zircons from the Hakatai Shale, Shinumo Quartzite, and Dox Formation. Based <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> radiometric dates, researchers have concluded that the Unkar Group was deposited between about 1254 and 1100 Ma, with a hiatus of unknown duration between the Hakatai Shale and Shinumo Quartzite.|$|E

[...] David Keenan of The Wire attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy with producers such as DJ Premier and DJ Shadow to Palmer, [...] "the original badass drummer [...] played <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tracks". He facetiously critiqued that the album's songs [...] "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." [...] Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod's first two records were [...] "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having [...] "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for Complex, DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named [...] "Holy Thursday" [...] the greatest hip hop sample of all time.|$|E

2500|$|Broadly speaking, existentialists {{hold that}} there are certain {{fundamental}} questions that every human being must come to terms with if they are to take their subjective existences seriously and with intrinsic value. Questions such as life, death, the meaning of human existence and the place of (or lack of) God in that existence are among them. By and large, the theories of existentialism assert that conscious reality is very complex and without an [...] "objective" [...] or universally known value: the individual must create value by affirming it and living it, not by simply talking about it or philosophising it in the mind. The play may be seen to touch <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> issues.|$|E
2500|$|Widespread {{drought in}} North China, {{combined}} with the imperialist designs of European powers and the instability of the Qing government, created conditions {{that led to the}} emergence of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists, or [...] "Boxers." [...] In 1900, local groups of Boxers proclaiming support for the Qing dynasty murdered foreign missionaries and large numbers of Chinese Christians, then converged on Beijing to besiege the Foreign Legation Quarter. A coalition of European, Japanese, and Russian armies (the Eight-Nation Alliance) then entered China without diplomatic notice, much less permission. Cixi declared war <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> nations, only to lose control of Beijing after a short, but hard-fought campaign. She fled to Xi'an. The victorious allies drew up scores of demands on the Qing government, including compensation for their expenses in invading China and execution of complicit officials.|$|E

2500|$|The Grateful Dead's {{early music}} (in the mid-1960s) {{was part of}} the process of {{establishing}} what [...] "psychedelic music" [...] was, but theirs was essentially a [...] "street party" [...] form of it. They developed their [...] "psychedelic" [...] playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> genres and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, [...] "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do." [...] Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.|$|E
2500|$|Development {{of the new}} Bf 109 F {{airframe}} {{had begun}} in 1939. After February 1940, an improved engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 601E, was developed for use with the Bf 109. The engineers at the Messerschmitt facilities took two Bf 109 E-1 airframes and installed this new powerplant. The first two prototypes, V21 (Werknummer (Works number) or W.Nr 5602) and V22 (W.Nr 1800) kept the trapeziform wing shape from the E-1, but the span was reduced by 61cm (2ft) by [...] "clipping" [...] the tips. Otherwise the wings incorporated the cooling system modifications described below. V22 also became the testbed for the pre-production DB 601E. The smaller wings had a detrimental effect on the handling so V23, Stammkennzeichen (factory Code) CE+BP, W.Nr 5603, was fitted with new, semi-elliptical wingtips, becoming the standard wing planform for all future Bf 109 combat versions. The fourth prototype, V24 VK+AB, W.Nr 5604, flew with the clipped wings but featured a modified, [...] "elbow"-shaped supercharger air-intake, which was eventually adopted for production, and a deeper oil cooler bath beneath the cowling. <b>On</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> prototypes, the fuselage was cleaned up and the engine cowling modified to improve aerodynamics.|$|E
