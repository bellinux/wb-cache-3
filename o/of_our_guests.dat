6000|$|The last remark I {{heard that}} night was a {{compliment}} to Mr. Bixby, uttered in soliloquy and with unction by one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> He said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. It is {{reserved}} {{exclusively for the}} employees. Some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> have private maids, who occasionally use the rear entrances, and Mrs. Tolliver's trained nurses are allowed to pass out that way, too; but----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He never {{allows the}} maid {{to bring in}} the salad," [...] Ethel explained, mirthfully. [...] "He {{considers}} a salad the culmination of his art, and generally announces for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> 'Heap fine salad! Muchey good.'" ...|$|E
60|$|September 15th.--I have {{to record}} a {{singularly}} pleasant day; due partly to a return of the fine weather, partly to the good social gifts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b>|$|R
60|$|AT {{the end of}} {{the fifth}} week <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest's</b> stay, among the letters which the morning's post brought to The Glen Tower there was one for me, from my son George, in the Crimea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, that is {{more than}} I can tell you, for he did not mention the family name of his mother; as she was a sister of Lady Dunluce, however, who is the wife of General Ducie, the father <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> it is {{probable}} her name was Dunluce." ...|$|R
60|$|We had {{provided}} apples and nuts, doughnuts, cider and other characteristic refreshments {{of the older}} day, but alas! most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> no longer took coffee at night, and {{only one or two}} had teeth for popcorn or stomach for doughnuts. As a feast our evening was a failure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so. The {{settlers}} seemed {{determined to}} make trouble. They have had another row with Gray Man's band, and shots have been fired. Fortunately no one was hurt. We must leave here early. Say nothing to any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> till we are safely on the way home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?" [...] said old Mr. Donnithorne, as {{she came}} to curtsy and take leave; [...] "I thought we should not part with any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are elderly people, think of sitting out the dance till then." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was at {{this party}} that I heard the first word of the {{criticism}} under which I had expected to suffer. One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> an old and privileged friend, remarked with a sigh, [...] "Well, now that Zuhl has married a writer, I suppose her own artistic career is at an end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{drive you}} myself {{with my own}} horses," [...] she said, [...] "but you need not be afraid, for I can drive a great deal better than I can row. We must lose no time in seizing all the {{advantages}} of this Amazonian life, for to-morrow some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> will arrive, the Foxes and Mr. Claude Locker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One day Mrs. Cheston {{gave me a}} luncheon, {{to which}} she invited {{a good many of}} the village ladies; and, after they were all gone, we two sat on the piazza and talked about them. Two or three <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> I had not met before, {{and in the course of}} our talk Emily {{mentioned}} the name of Margaret Temple.|$|E
60|$|So I {{locked the}} door from the kitchen {{into the house and}} then the outside door of the kitchen, and when my wife came down we hurried off. On the way I told her what I {{intended}} to do, and what I thought <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> She answered scarcely a word, and I hoped that she was frightened. I think she was.|$|R
60|$|The fishy-eyed {{young man}} became one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> regular <b>guests.</b> Dan won his heart by never {{laughing}} at him.|$|R
60|$|As he {{said these}} words, the {{fluorescent}} light brightened for a second, and then faded entirely away. A slightly unpleasant odour also accompanied the departure <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest.</b> In a moment, spectre and scent alike disappeared; but careful examination with a delicate test exhibited a faint reaction which proved {{the presence of}} sulphur in small quantities. The ghost had evidently vanished quite according to established precedent.|$|R
60|$|This episode had {{restored}} Mrs. Fordyce, {{and while}} providing some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> with wine, {{and others with}} tea, we heard the story, only interrupted by Martyn's return from a vain search, and Anne's consequent tears, which, however, were somehow hushed and smothered by fears of being sent to bed, coupled with his promises to search {{every step of the}} way to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|In this unassuming fashion we fed the Hernes, the Severances, {{and other}} {{of our most}} valued friends who devoured the puddings which Zulime [...] "tossed up," [...] with a gusto highly {{flattering}} to her skill, while the sight of me as baby-tender proved singularly amusing--to some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> It will be seen {{that we were not}} cutting entirely loose from the principles of economy in which we had been so carefully schooled--our hospitalities had very distinct (enforced) limits.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{we began}} with demands for home news, and, {{when we had}} pumped out of them every drop they had, we began to sing songs and to spin yarns. And it was now that my friend Tom Lokins came out strong, and went on at such a rate, that he quite won the hearts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> Tom was not noisy, and he was slow in his talk, {{but he had the}} knack of telling a good story; he never used a wrong word, or a word too many, and, having a great deal of humour, men could not help {{listening}} when he began to talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] {{was their}} cry. [...] "Right on the slayer of Odorik, {{the son of}} Odo, of the lineage <b>of</b> Odin, <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> and <b>of</b> the King's trust." ...|$|R
60|$|The hours flew on; the {{servants}} brought {{in that light}} banquet whose entrance in the country seems the only method <b>of</b> reminding <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> {{that there is a}} morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you will}} find Mr. Bradley so sceptical {{that you will be}} obliged to defer your going," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, triumphantly. [...] "Come, Louise, we must not forget that we have still Mr. Mainwaring's present comfort to look after; that Minty has basely deserted us, and that we {{ourselves}} must see that the last days <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> beneath <b>our</b> roof are not remembered for their privation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure it is. Of {{course we}} {{have trouble with}} McAlister at times, but he's always very {{reasonable}} when we put things in the right light. Last week, for example, I was afraid that we {{had gone too far}} with him. He is always accustomed to have a quart of beer every morning at half-past ten--the maids are told to bring it out to him, and after that he goes to sleep in the little arbour beside the tulip bed. And the other day when he went there he found that one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> who hadn't been told, was actually sitting in there reading. Of course he was furious. I was afraid for the moment that he would give notice on the spot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was justice done.--Mr Wilder, I fear {{you find}} our service a little irregular; but {{a month of}} {{experience}} will put you on a level with us, and remove all danger of such another scene." [...] As the Rover spoke, he faced his recruit, with a countenance that endeavoured to be cheerful, but whose gaiety could force itself no further than a frightful smile. [...] "Come," [...] he quickly added, [...] "this time, I set the mischief afoot myself; and, as you see we are completely masters, we may afford to be lenient. Besides," [...] he continued, glancing his eyes towards the place where Mrs Wyllys and Gertrude still remained in deep suspense awaiting his decision, [...] "it may be well to consult the sex <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> at such a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile, you are free; so to-morrow, {{while you}} ride about the garden, {{as you will}} do, {{take note of the}} tall rock that stands without, and how to reach it from any point, even in the dark. To-morrow, also, when the moon is up, they will lead you to the narrow bridge, to ride your horses to and fro there, that they may learn not to fear it in that light. When you have stabled them go into the gardens and come hither unobserved, as the place being so far away you can do. The guards will let you pass, {{thinking}} only that you desire to drink a cup of wine with some fair friend, as is the custom <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests.</b> Enter this cave--here is the key," [...] and she handed it to Wulf, [...] "and if I be not there, await me. Then I will tell you my plan, if I have any, but until then I must scheme and think. Now it grows late--go." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the latest}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> blogs, London College of Communications student Lydia Polzer, {{who was born}} in the old DDR or East Germany, {{reflects}} on how many people in the former Communist countries are disappointed with the ‘freedoms’ offered by the western liberal news media. This article was also the winner for a UNESCO essay competition which set the question: “The greatest threat to media freedom in the world is…” This is Lydia’s view...|$|R

5000|$|Usually … Alexei Nikolaevich {{read them}} to me, {{avoiding}} {{the presence of}} visitors. But this time, he was so thrilled with his stories, and so proud of them, {{that he did not}} wait for the departure <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> (a waitress) but came out of his study with the manuscript in his hands and straight into the dining room and, resting his elbows {{on the back of a}} chair, stood reading the story. We both responded enthusiastically." ...|$|R
6000|$|The invalid {{sister had}} made such rapid {{progress}} toward recovery that the travelers had arranged to set forth on their journey back to England in a fortnight. [...] "My one regret," [...] Cecilia added, [...] "is the parting with Lady Doris. She {{and her husband}} are going to Genoa, where they will embark in Lord Janeaway's yacht for a cruise in the Mediterranean. When we have said that miserable word good-by--oh, Emily, what a hurry I shall be in to get back to you! Those allusions to your lonely life are so dreadful, my dear, that I have destroyed your letter; it is enough to break one's heart only to look at it. When once I get to London, there shall be no more solitude for my poor afflicted friend. Papa will be free from his parliamentary duties in August--and he has promised to have the house full of delightful people to meet you.

60|$|From these topics, we glide into {{a review}} of the most celebrated and horrible of the great crimes that have been {{committed}} within the last fifteen or twenty years. The men engaged in the discovery of almost all of them, and in the pursuit or apprehension of the murderers, are here, down to the very last instance. One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> gave chase to and boarded the emigrant ship, in which the murderess last hanged in London was supposed to have embarked. We learn from him that his errand was not announced to the passengers, who may have no idea of it to this hour. That he went below, with the captain, lamp in hand - it being dark, and the whole steerage abed and sea-sick - and engaged the Mrs. Manning who WAS on board, in a conversation about her luggage, until she was, with no small pains, induced to raise her head, and turn her face towards the light. Satisfied that she was not the object of his search, he quietly re-embarked in the Government steamer along-side, and steamed home again with the intelligence.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was one of}} the few unanimities {{of these}} parties that every one should be a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the tie or the shoes or more generally, and that bursts of violent {{aggression}} should alternate with an attitude entirely defensive. A number <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> had an air of waiting for a clue that never came, and stood and sat about silently, mildly amused but not a bit surprised that we did not discover their distinctive Open-Sesames. There was a sprinkling of manifest seers and prophetesses in shapeless garments, far too many, I thought, for really easy social intercourse, and any conversation at any moment was liable to become oracular. One was in a state of tension from first to last; the most innocent remark seemed capable of exploding resentment, and replies came out at the most unexpected angles. We Young Liberals went about puzzled but polite to the gathering we had evoked. The Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole wonderfully discreet, superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the Balkans or Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting Harblow, and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats indicative of the House, or in what is sometimes written of as [...] "faultless evening dress," [...] stood about on those evenings, they and their very quietly and simply and expensively dressed little wives, like a datum line amidst lakes and mountains.|$|E
6000|$|You've {{heard it}} before, and you'll hear it many, many times more. It is an anecdote <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> <b>of</b> {{the time when}} he was engaged as {{a young man with a}} gentle Hebrew, in the process of {{skinning}} the client. The main part in that business is the collection of the bill for services in skinning the man. [...] "Services" [...] is the term used in that craft for the operation of that kind-diplomatic in its nature.|$|R

6000|$|I {{had taken}} care of that. I knew how [...] "that that there Fotsky" [...] was the ogre of the riots, and I had guarded against his {{identification}} by speaking <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> as the foreign gentleman who had come home with Mr. Harold, and causing him to be called Count Stanislas; and, on hearing this, Eustace became so urgent in his entreaties, that Harold, though much hurt, relented {{so far as to}} promise at any rate to remain till Monday, so that Dora should not detect the offence.|$|R
