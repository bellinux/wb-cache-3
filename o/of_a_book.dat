5|$|One of the {{original}} motivations for studying book embeddings involved applications in VLSI design, in which the vertices <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> embedding represent components of a circuit and the wires represent connections between them.|$|E
5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives the price <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E

5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is {{the maximum number}} of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings in which each edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E
5|$|Applying the {{proceeds}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> deal, {{the family moved}} in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.

50|$|In 2011, Donnelly, {{unhappy with}} the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>books</b> {{category}} on Fox-TV's Teen Choice Awards, started Just Add Books on Facebook, in which she appealed to readers to write to Rupert Murdoch and request that <b>a</b> <b>books</b> category {{be added to the}} show. In 2012, the Teen Choice Awards added <b>a</b> <b>books</b> category. Fox has never acknowledged Donnelly or Just Add Books.|$|R
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during the publication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> causing significant expense both {{for himself and}} the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often {{was different from the}} original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E
5|$|Images of Norman {{have been}} used to attract {{attention}} by some outside of the Unarius Academy of Science. In 1996, an MTV executive viewed a picture of Norman and decided to use her image in an advertising campaign for the MTV Music Video Awards. The network contacted the Unarius Academy of Science and received permission to use a look-alike in their promotions. In 2000, Norman was featured on the cover <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about personalities with fringe beliefs.|$|E
5|$|One of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion's mascots, Horrie the Wog Dog, was {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> by Ion Idriess; the book was based on stories recounted by the dog's owner, Jim Moody, {{who served as a}} machine gunner in the 2/1st.

5|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> as a topological space, {{was defined}} by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, {{and the only way}} that two edges can intersect is for them to meet at a common endpoint.|$|E
5|$|The text <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Book</b> of the Dead {{was written}} in both black and red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E

5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> about his life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire {{to stop him from}} publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Allan Webb {{resumed his}} stage {{career with the}} role of Count Almaviva in the 1946 Sadler's Wells {{production}} of The Marriage of Figaro. In 1947 he appeared in the original run of the Vivian Ellis musical Bless the Bride, and made several further stage appearances in the following two years. During this time he had a brief affair with the actress Sydney Malcolm, for which Gibbons quickly forgave him. He left the theatre in 1949 to become a director <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> club specialising in special editions, and later bought a bookshop in the Archway district of London. His health failed in the late 1950s and in 1958 he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died in July 1959 at Oakshott Avenue.|$|E
