This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve <b>over</b> <b>current</b> helicopter designs.|$|E

Another $500,000 study was ordered in 2003 by the legislature, creating a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County in the south to the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. Had either proposal been built, it would have essentially replaced highway 203 with an interstate highway.|$|E

2500|$|An {{overcurrent}} relay {{is a type}} of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value. The ANSI device number is 50 for an instantaneous <b>over</b> <b>current</b> (IOC) or a Definite Time Overcurrent (DTOC). In a typical application the <b>over</b> <b>current</b> relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level. When the relay operates, one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip (open) a circuit breaker. The Definite Time Overcurrent Relay has been used extensively in the United Kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source {{led to the development of}} the IDMT relay.|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War, Klein {{published}} {{two more}} books, Poems and The Hitleriad, both in 1944. Poems developed ideas forecast in Hath Not a Jew but also reflected Klein's anxieties <b>over</b> <b>current</b> {{events and the}} plight of Jews {{in the wake of}} the Holocaust. Poems such as [...] "Polish Village," [...] "Meditation Upon Survival," [...] and [...] "Elegy" [...] were thoroughly contemporary accounts of persecution and suffering with which Klein, despite his relative safety in Canada, deeply sympathized. The Hitleriad was a very different work, a mock epic written in a satirical style reminiscent of Alexander Pope in such works as The Dunciad. In it, Klein attempted to satirize Adolf Hitler and his Nazi cohorts, although later critics often noted that the inescapable bitterness of the subject caused Klein's humorous intentions to run awry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Aim of {{this paper}} is to reduce the losses and {{improving}} voltages by connecting number of Distributed Generation (DG) at optimal places. Ant Colony Search Algorithm (ACSA) is used for optimal allocation and sizing of DG in distribution network. ACSA is a software program which is implemented in MATLAB. In this paper the output results shows that as the number of DG’s increases up to 5 the voltages of all the buses increases and losses decreases and more than 5 DG’s losses are increased. The optimal allocation of DG’s is implemented on IEEE 15 bus system. The improper allocation causes to <b>over</b> <b>currents,</b> <b>over</b> voltages and harmonics in the distribution network...|$|R
