5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. <b>Over</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon has evolved <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> new {{information has been}} obtained from fossils.

As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing <b>over</b> <b>time</b> (<b>as</b> described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. <b>Over</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> they grow larger.|$|E

He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear <b>over</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> he is not aware of all of them {{at the start of the}} show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough to command its many armies in the field or {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and the device was used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E
