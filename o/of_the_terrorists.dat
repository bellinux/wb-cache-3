5|$|The raid lasted {{seventeen}} {{minutes and}} involved 30–35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during the raid while the SAS killed {{all but one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists.</b> The rescued hostages and the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy's back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> primary aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrorist</b> Transgressions network {{which is}} {{presented}} {{here was to}} analyse the myths inscribed in images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> and identify how agency is attributed to representation through invocations and inversions of gender stereotypes. Although terrorism, its contexts, histories and forms, has been <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> intense academic activity in recent years, especially in <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> politics and international relations, cultural representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> have received less attention. While <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> is predominantly aligned with masculinity, women have been active in <b>terrorist</b> organizations since <b>the</b> late nineteenth century. Particularly since the 1980 s, women have perpetrated suicidal terrorist attacks, including suicide bombing, where the body becomes a weapon. Such attacks have confounded constructions of femininity and masculinity, with profound implications for <b>the</b> gendering <b>of</b> violence and horror. The network established {{that there is a}} shift away from analyses of cultural representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Army Faction, which have dominated the literature since the 1980 s. New work has emerged examining representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> and gender, including investigations <b>of</b> material from <b>the</b> 1970 s, recently made available in archives. There also has been a shift in terms of military discourses around <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy or <b>terrorist</b> insurgent in relation to visualizing the invisible enemy. Emerging work on colonial insurgencies contributed to a historical understanding of such debates...|$|R

25|$|On Lido Deck, {{below the}} bridge and above the lounge the other hostages were being held on, the {{separated}} hostages were forced to lie on the deck.
