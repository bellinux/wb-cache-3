40|$|Abstract. We {{extended}} the PayWord scheme, it supports shopping at multiple vendors without an <b>on-line</b> <b>broker</b> or an on-line secure database. The credit-based system uses one hash chain, hence besides the secret key only the seed and a random value should be securely stored. The proposed scheme is analyzed in applied pi calculus, we {{prove that it}} fulfills payment approval, secure payment authorization, secrecy of payment information and unreusability. ...|$|E
30|$|We {{also look}} at {{the effect of the}} {{household}} being an on-line banking user. The fact that stocks can be bought and sold through <b>on-line</b> <b>brokers</b> brings down participation and information costs. On-line trading is usually less costly than the traditional telephone or physical services in terms of fees, plus it is less time consuming and allows the investor to access a great wealth of information with reduced effort. The effect of being an on-line banking user is significant at the 1  % level.|$|R
50|$|Proton Bank was {{a member}} of Athens Stock Exchange, EUREX and Cyprus Stock Exchange.It was the first broker in Greece to {{establish}} and operate the Reuters Order Routing system in both modes, allowing Proton Bank to operate in Execution Venue Mode receiving orders directly <b>on-line</b> from foreign <b>brokers</b> for the Athens Exchange, as well as in Order Entry Mode placing orders directly <b>on-line</b> to foreign <b>brokers,</b> members of international exchanges.Proton Bank consistently ranked among the top ten brokers in Greece in terms of market share in the cash market. A top ten position is also being held in the rank in the derivatives market.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of very detailed data on financial market, agent-based modeling is hindered {{by the lack of}} information about real trader behavior. This makes it impossible to validate agent-based models, which are thus reverse-engineering attempts. This work is a contribution to the building of a set of stylized facts about the traders themselves. Using the client database of Swissquote Bank SA, the largest <b>on-line</b> Swiss <b>broker,</b> we find empirical relationships between turnover, account values and the number of assets in which a trader is invested. A theory based on simple mean-variance portfolio optimization that crucially includes variable transaction costs is able to reproduce faithfully the observed behaviors. We finally argue that our results bring into light the collective ability of a population to construct a mean-variance portfolio that takes into account the structure of transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{birth and}} growth of a US West Coast {{information}} company is chronicled from its beginning as a part-time partnership to its status five years later as a small but profitable corporation providing information services to Government agencies as well as graduate students. Documentation Associates provides a search and retrieval service that includes <b>brokering</b> <b>on-line</b> data-base searches, and the investment required {{to set up and}} maintain this kind of operation is described. Some information-broker policies are discussed, e. g. service types, pricing methods, and the reasons for the wide disparity in data-base search prices are examined. The policies of Documentation Associates in the operation of its broker service are presented. Copyright the Technology Transfer Society 1977 Information brokers, Data bases, Pricing policies,...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{innovation}} in rapidly moving environments, such as Interned-based services, {{is a major}} challenge for the consolidated theories on product and service development. The innovation management literature identifies flexibility as the right way for coping with these challenges. By increasing the development process flexibility, {{it is possible to}} reduce the development time as well as the time and cost needed for last-minute concept changes. But this is not enough. The product or service must also be flexible after it has been released: A life-cycle flexibility (LCF) must be pursued. Focused on the Italian <b>on-line</b> discount <b>brokers</b> industry, this article is a result of a two-staged research process that started with a qualitative explorative phase (i. e., case-study methodology) and ended with a quantitative explorative one (i. e., questionnaire methodology). It identifies three different LCF dimensions —frequency of adaptation, rapidity of adaptation, and quality of adaptation—and it defines a metric for each of them. Subsequently, it identifies five managerial and organizational practices that increase {{at least one of the}} three LCF dimensions: (1) to manage the back-end technological competences; (2) to share the front-end technological competences with external suppliers; (3) to utilize open and standard technologies; (4) to have a low formalization of the new service development (NSD) procedures; and (5) to have high formalization of the NSD organization...|$|R
