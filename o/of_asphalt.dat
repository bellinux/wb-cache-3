5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally straightened. On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> and crushed rock. The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E

Adding cement to mixture can improve the pavement performance of mixture greatly. However, increasing the content <b>of</b> emulsified <b>asphalt</b> has opposite effect.

40|$|Breakthroughs {{have been}} made in natural gas {{exploration}} in Sinian reservoirs in the Tongwan Palaeo-uplift, Sichuan Basin, recently. However, there are disputes with regard to the genetic mechanisms of natural gas reservoirs. The development law <b>of</b> <b>asphalts</b> in the Sinian reservoirs may play an extremely important role {{in the study of the}} relationships between palaeo oil and gas reservoirs. Accordingly, researches were conducted on the features and development patterns <b>of</b> <b>asphalts</b> in the Sinian reservoirs in this area. The following research results were obtained. (1) Asphalts in the Sinian reservoirs were developed after the important hydrothermal event in the Sichuan Basin, namely the well-known Emei Taphrogeny in the mid-late Permian Period. (2) Distribution <b>of</b> <b>asphalts</b> is related to palaeo oil reservoirs under the control of palaeo-structures of Indosinian-Yanshanian Period, when the palaeo-structures contained high content <b>of</b> <b>asphalts</b> in the high positions of the palaeo-uplift. (3) Large-scale oil and gas accumulations in the Sinian reservoirs occurred in the Indosinian-Yanshanian Period to generate the Leshan-Ziyang and Gaoshiti-Moxi-Guang'an palaeo oil reservoirs. Cracking of crude oil in the major parts of these palaeo oil reservoirs controlled the development of the present natural gas reservoirs. (4) The development <b>of</b> <b>asphalts</b> in the Sinian reservoirs indicates that hydrocarbons in the Dengying Formation originated from Cambrian source rocks and natural gas accumulated in the Sinian reservoirs are products of late-stage cracking of the Sinian reservoirs. (5) The Sinian palaeo-structures of Indosinian-Yanshanian Period in the Sichuan Basin are favorable regions for the development of the Sinian reservoirs, where discoveries and exploration practices will play an important role in the era of Sinian natural gas development in China...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> {{reclaimed}} <b>asphalt</b> pavement (RAP) in {{the construction}} <b>of</b> new <b>asphalt</b> pavements is beneficial because it provides both cost savings and reduction of environmental effects. Recently, warm-mix asphalt (WMA) technology was applied to asphalt recycling at a lower than conventional temperature. As a result, warm-recycled asphalt possibly increases the usage of RAP material, saves energy and reduces CO 2 emission. The main {{purposes of this study}} are to examine the influences of polyethylene wax-based WMA additive on the optimum <b>asphalt</b> content <b>of</b> warm-recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture based on the Marshall mix design and to evaluate performance <b>of</b> warm-recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture containing 30 % RAP with polyethylene wax-based WMA additive in terms of the rutting and stripping resistances. Based on the limited laboratory test results, polyethylene wax-based WMA additive is effective to decrease mixing and compacting temperatures without compromising the volumetric characteristics <b>of</b> warm-recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixtures compared to hot-recycled asphalt mixture. Also, it doesn’t affect the optimum asphalt content on recycled-asphalt mixture. Overall, the performance <b>of</b> warm-recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture using polyethylene wax-based WMA additive is comparable to hot-recycled asphalt mixture...|$|R

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E

40|$|The asphalt {{modification}} by {{the addition}} of crumb rubber is a technique used in the last years to improve the properties <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> mixtures mainly the fatigue and permanent resistance deformation. The analysis <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> rubber properties to predict its performance can be done through different tests being rheology a widely used technique since asphalt is a viscoelastic material and highly dependent on temperature. With the rheology test, parameters such as complex shear modulus (G*) and phase angle (?) are obtained, being possible to understand the evolution of the fatigue and permanent deformation resistance as well as the viscous and elastic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt.</b> Also, the properties <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> rubber are dependent <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt</b> type and crumb rubber used in the modification <b>of</b> the <b>asphalt.</b> In this work four asphalt rubbers were studied produced with 35 / 50 and 50 / 70 pen asphalt modified with cryogenic and ambient grinding crumb rubber. Since the digestion has an important influence in the asphalt rubber, in this work the mixing time <b>of</b> each <b>asphalt</b> was studied, testing asphalt rubbers produced up to 48 hours of digestion time. For each digestion time studied (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 24, 30 and 48 hours) rheology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests were conducted. The results of rheology tests show that G* and ? are dependent on digestion time as well as the type <b>of</b> conventional <b>asphalt</b> and crumb rubber modifier.
