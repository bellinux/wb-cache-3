5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only lessens each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region {{as a whole is}} less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity</b> and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda.

He directed removal <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity</b> from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{predominantly}} white in terms <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> with 91.8% {{of the population}} belonging to this ethnic group. Portsmouth's long association with the Royal Navy means that it {{represents one of the}} most diverse cities in terms of the peoples of the British Isles. Similarly, some {{of the largest and most}} well-established non-white communities have their roots with the Royal Navy, most notably the large Chinese community, principally from British Hong Kong. Portsmouth's long industrial history in support of the Royal Navy has seen many people from across the British Isles move to Portsmouth to work in the factories and docks, the largest of these groups being Irish Catholics. According to 2011 census, the ethnic breakdown of Portsmouth's population is as follows: 84.0% White British, 3.8% Other White, 1.3% Chinese, 1.4% Indian, 0.5% Mixed-Race, 1.8% Bangladeshi, 0.5% Other ethnic group, 1.4% Black African, 0.5% White Irish, 1.3% Other Asian, 0.3% Pakistani, 0.3% Black Caribbean and 0.1% Other Black.|$|E
5|$|The {{late onset}} of Huntington's disease means {{it does not}} usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} prevalence of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically as a result <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of}} the world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare lifestyle behaviours of middle-Aged to older adults <b>of</b> Lebanese <b>ethnicity</b> born in Lebanon, Australia, and elsewhere to those <b>of</b> Australian <b>ethnicity.</b> Participants were 37, 419 Australians aged ¿ 45 years, from the baseline dataset of The 45 and Up Study which included 4 groups of interest: Those <b>of</b> Australian <b>ethnicity</b> (n = 36, 707) [Reference]; those <b>of</b> Lebanese <b>ethnicity</b> born in Lebanon (n = 346); 302 those <b>of</b> Lebanese <b>ethnicity</b> born in Australia (n = 302); and those <b>of</b> Lebanese <b>ethnicity</b> born elsewhere (n = 64).

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{it can be}} {{said that}} in scholarship, as well as popular discourse, there has been a {{tendency}} of talking about indigenous peoples in terms <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> about afro-minorities and white socio-economic privilege in terms of race, and about mestizos in tems of national identity. It is now however becoming recognized that processes of identity formation and social stratification in regards to all population groups in Mexico can be analyzed both in terms of race and <b>of</b> <b>ethnicity.</b>|$|E
