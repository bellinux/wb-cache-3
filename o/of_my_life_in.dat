5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> the Bush of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written {{but that did not}} have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.|$|E

500|$|Later in 2010 when {{recording}} {{her third}} album, Here I Am (2011), Rowland credited both Guetta {{and the song}} for inspiring her to pursue a new sound. Rowland relates: [...] "I spent about a year <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> Europe really listening to {{a whole bunch of}} Europeans DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' it was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." [...] In 2010, following the success of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] and the duo's musical chemistry, Guetta was asked to work on Rowland's third studio album. He co-produced a couple of the songs including the album's first single, [...] "Commander".|$|E
500|$|With the {{resumption}} of full League football again in the 1946–47 season, Shankly returned to Preston who held his registration, but he was now 33 and coming {{to the end of}} his playing days. By 1949, he was Preston's club captain but had lost his place in the first team, which was struggling against relegation despite having Tom Finney in the side. Shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so, when Carlisle United asked him to become their manager in March of that year, he retired as a player and accepted the job. Shankly's departure from Preston was resented by some at the club and he was refused a benefit match, to which he felt entitled. He described Preston's attitude as [...] "the biggest let-down <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> football".|$|E

500|$|Ghosts I–IV is {{an almost}} entirely {{instrumental}} album, {{with only a few}} tracks containing sampled vocals. Reznor described the album's sound as [...] "the result of working from a very visual perspective—dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams." [...] PopMatters' review of the album compared its musical style to that of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp, ultimately categorizing it as [...] "dark ambient". The review went on to describe the music as [...] "a tonal painting, a collection of moods and not all of these moods are good ones." [...] NPR compared the album to the music of Erik Satie and Brian Eno; Rolling Stones review to [...] Brian Eno, specifically the album's sound to the instrumentals of Another Green World (1975) and the rhythm collages <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> the Bush of Ghosts (1981). Robert Christgau also compared the album to the work of Brian Eno, summarizing Ghosts sound as [...] "mental wallpaper".|$|E
500|$|Müller {{announced}} his candidacy on 14 May 1860, {{six days after}} Wilson's death. His submission to Convocation referred to his work in editing the Rig Veda, saying that without it missionaries could not fully learn about the teachings of Hinduism, which impeded their work. He therefore considered that he had [...] "spent the principal part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> promoting {{the object of the}} Founder of the Chair of Sanskrit." [...] He promised to work exclusively on Sanskrit, and said that he would provide testimonials from [...] "the most eminent Sanskrit scholars in Europe and India" [...] and from missionaries who had used his publications to help [...] "overthrow the ancient systems of idolatry" [...] in India. In due course, he was able to provide a list of missionary societies that had requested copies of the Rig Veda from the East India Company, including the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{recorded}} all the tracks, as {{they were}} after Belew had performed on them, in a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. The lyricist used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes {{in the style of}} Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer [...] "hearing nonsense". After the frontman was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were followed by the overdubbing process. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had been working on parts <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>in</b> the Bush of Ghosts, was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Neutral Milk Hotel {{formed in}} 1989 as an {{offshoot}} of Milk, a high school musical project of singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum, and the band was largely a Mangum solo project in the group's earlier days. The group {{was a part of}} The Elephant 6 Recording Company, a collective of musicians that includes, among others, notable indie rock bands The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, and Of Montreal. The 1993 single [...] "Everything Is" [...] was the band's first release, and it would later be reissued as an EP with additional tracks. The band's first studio album, On Avery Island, was released on the independent label Merge, and has sold a relatively high 5,000 copies. Afterwards, the band began to tour for the first time, and grew to include horns player Scott Spillane, multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, and drummer Jeremy Barnes. In 1998 the band released In the Aeroplane over the Sea on Merge, an album which has since {{become one of the most}} popular and acclaimed indie rock albums of the 1990s. Up until 2011's Ferris Wheel on Fire EP, the band had had no new releases since In the Aeroplane over the Sea, though Mangum has said [...] "I don't know what's going to happen, but I certainly want to make music a bigger part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the future than it has been for the last couple of years." ...|$|E
