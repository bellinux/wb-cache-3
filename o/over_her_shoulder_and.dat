5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They {{look at each other}} briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man with a pair of binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I canâ€™t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where {{a professor in the}} hall (the same man who appeared in their previous single's video [...] "Black Magic") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall off the chair.|$|E
60|$|Biddy now {{pulled her}} cloak from off her head, settled it <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{prepared}} for telling a good substantial story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Princess; ask {{whatever}} you will," [...] returned the Queen, as she threw a scarlet cloak <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> prepared to start.|$|R
5000|$|... wears a fur cap {{shaped like}} a gable hood. She wears a linen kerchief or capelet draped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a sheer parlet, 1527-28.|$|R
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was {{and looks up at}} both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
60|$|She {{flung it}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> danced around the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|The maid glanced <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> went on {{preparing}} her mistress's clothes.|$|E
60|$|Her {{golden hair}} hung heavy <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> she looked supremely happy. She greeted my {{entrance}} with a smile, {{and took me}} at once into her confidence.|$|R
60|$|The negress reappears. She {{has pulled}} the dressing-gown perfunctorily <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{continues}} <b>her</b> experiments with the scarf, {{not at all}} put out, and rather amused by Surge's prudery.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they did}} so two forms {{appeared}} around the house. One was Mrs. Stanhope, wearing a shawl <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a bonnet on her head, and the second was Josiah Crabtree! ...|$|R
60|$|She merely {{throws a}} laugh <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> stands her ground with folded arms.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped as}} the word passed her lips, looked back <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> started violently.|$|E
60|$|The girl threw a {{laughing}} look back <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> vanished {{through the door}} into the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--got away," [...] {{she said}} savagely. But {{she was taken}} with a sudden nervous shiver, which she at once {{repressed}} by tightly dragging <b>her</b> shawl <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> elbows, and folding her arms defiantly.|$|R
60|$|Beresteyn {{followed}} {{close on}} his sister's heels. He touched <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{just as she}} stood outside the portal, wrapping her fur cloak more snugly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> looking round <b>her,</b> anxious where to find her servants.|$|R
60|$|She wore {{a pointed}} cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, her hair {{streamed}} loose <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> she {{walked with a}} staff. Jack took off his cap and made her a bow.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> sighed. A trim parlor maid {{was busy}} {{arranging}} {{a small table}} under the cedar tree.|$|E
60|$|The {{girls were}} just walking past this lot when Helen {{happened}} to glance <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> {{set up a}} cry of alarm.|$|E
6000|$|His wife overheard him and pausing in her task of {{refilling}} {{the glasses}} {{for the rich}} man's party she looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Aunt Ruey, I'll try to {{remember}} all," [...] said Mrs. Pennel, as {{she stood at the}} glass in her bedroom, carefully adjusting the respectable black silk shawl <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> tying <b>her</b> neat bonnet-strings.|$|R
60|$|She {{had escaped}} from Mrs. Goss' custody and now ranged up {{alongside}} of Dan Baxter and her other enemies who were handling the Flyaway. Her hair was flying wildly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> she trembled {{so she could}} scarcely stand.|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped on}} the stairs, hesitating. Whereupon the Captain hastily ripped open the bundle {{under his arm and}} {{produced}} a very handsome India shawl. With a cry of delight Virginia threw it <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> ran to the long glass between the high windows.|$|R
6000|$|She glanced <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> saw Hoopdriver. [...] "Damn!" [...] {{said the}} other man in brown, quite audibly, {{starting}} as he followed her glance.|$|E
6000|$|He half hesitated, and then, as if scorning an equivocation, made a hasty gesture <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> said bluntly, [...] "No, I {{came over}} the cliff." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> he noticed with a twinge of delight how her little chin came out beneath {{the curve of her}} cheek.|$|E
60|$|Juliette {{was not yet}} in bed, for {{she went}} to the door herself and opened it. Obviously she had been quite unable to rest, her hair was falling loosely <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> there was a look of grave anxiety on her young face.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman he}} {{referred}} to was old and feeble and very short sighted. She had a faded shawl <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> carried a market basket on one arm. She went out nursing among the poor people and was well known throughout the entire neighborhood.|$|R
60|$|Lady Scatcherd, {{holding a}} vast counterpane in her arms, looked back <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> {{perceived}} that Frank {{was in the}} room. Down went the counterpane on the ground, and Frank soon {{found himself in the}} very position which that useful article had so lately filled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but we are}} on the Minster ground, nurse," [...] said Lucy, {{trembling}} {{a little}} however, looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> coming closer to the old servant.|$|E
6000|$|Aline {{smiled at}} me <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> I stared at him in amaze, saying, [...] "I never found it either {{particularly}} easy or peaceful. I don't quite understand you." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{held the}} sheet <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> Imogene came languidly and took it; Mrs. Bowen dropped her face {{forward on the}} desk, into her hands, while Imogene was reading.|$|E
60|$|Mariposilla was now awake. Her {{hair had}} fallen <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> the little {{necklace}} still encircled her throat. About her eyes lingered the rosy flush of her unbroken sleep. She sat {{up as we}} entered, pushing quickly beneath her nightgown sleeve a tiny rim of gold.|$|R
6000|$|A {{little group}} of friends {{surrounded}} the great Senator with hymns of praise and congratulations. Old adversaries saluted him courteously as they passed by with the respect of strong men. A little woman with a shawl drawn <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> held with one small brown hand, approached him timidly: ...|$|R
60|$|Ida {{threw the}} shawl <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> {{followed}} by Harold walked {{on through the}} garden till {{she came to the}} edge of the moat, where there was a seat. Here she sat down and fixed her eyes upon the hoary battlements of the gateway, now clad in a solemn robe of moonlight.|$|R
