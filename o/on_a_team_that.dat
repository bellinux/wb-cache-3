When the AAFC went out of {{existence}} after the 1949 season, Chappuis retired from football. In announcing his retirement in June 1950, Chappuis said he was through with professional football and that his ambition then was to enjoy a more leisurely lifestyle {{and to be able}} to visit Ann Arbor for those fall football games.|$|E

5|$|In 2002–03, Parker {{played in}} all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio's {{starting}} point guard <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 {{points per game}} (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker's role as the team's playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural 989 Sports Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often substituted for the more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games.|$|E
25|$|Morris {{played one}} final season of {{professional}} football with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1991. Morris ran for 591 yards and caught 28 passes for 263 yards in 12 regular season games.

25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} Boston, Massachusetts {{and played}} college {{football}} at the University of Notre Dame, where he was named an All-American <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> won the national championship in 1943. After {{two years in the}} military during World War II, Yonakor was selected {{in the first round of}} the 1945 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He instead signed with the Browns of the upstart AAFC. Yonakor spent four seasons playing primarily as a defensive end for the Browns as the team won four league championships between 1946 and 1949. The Browns then sold Yonakor to the NFL's New York Yanks, where he played for a year. He then spent a season with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. Returning to the NFL in 1952, he played a final season for the Redskins before retiring.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2006, Foye was {{selected}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He entered his rookie year <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> already had six guards on its roster. Off-season free-agent acquisition Mike James was slated to start at point guard, Foye's most likely position in the NBA, with Ricky Davis at small forward and Rashad McCants at shooting guard. This left Foye to battle for minutes on a bench full of guards. In November, Foye's first month as a professional basketball player, Timberwolves coach Dwane Casey only gave Foye an average of 14.6 minutes per game. Foye, however, was productive whenever he was given minutes. He scored in double digits {{in each of the}} four games he was given 20 or more minutes of playing time.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} had been {{actually}} accomplished for Panathinaikos (PAO) {{and the years}} to come would prove it. Alvertis was actually an amazing prospect at the time, almost 10cm (4inches) taller than the conventional shooting guard. His potential was proven to be great in the 1991 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, where Alvertis led, alongside Panagiotis Liadelis, the Greek team to the silver medal. At the same time, Panathinaikos was going through a transition period during which the average team of the late 1980s strove to become a European powerhouse. Consequently, young Alvertis had to wait until the 1993–94 season to get significant playing time <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> reached the EuroLeague Final Four that year. The star of the twenty-year-old player shone right away, particularly in the playoff series against Limoges CSP. Alvertis averaged 13 points, forcing Coach Božidar Maljković to declare that he already was to be counted as one of the very best players in Europe.|$|E

In its first year in Denver, the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup after finishing the regular season with the second best league record and winning the Pacific Division. Forsberg scored 116 points {{in the regular season}} (30 goals, 86 assists) and 21 more in the playoffs (10 goals, 11 assists). Forsberg finished second in points standings in team and fifth overall in the League in the regular and post-season. During game two of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Florida Panthers, Forsberg scored three goals in a period and became the sixth player in NHL history to do so. Not only was the 1995–96 NHL season Forsberg's highest scoring season, but it would also be the only NHL season in which he played in all his team's games.|$|E

While a junior, Rolle tripled his points-per-game average from 4.0 to 12.2. He was named to the All-WAC (Western Athletic Conference) Defensive Team and All-WAC Newcomer Team. In his senior year, he led the WAC in blocks and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing only two seasons.|$|E

López also was in the top 10 in doubles and runs scored in 1958 and in sacrifice hits in 1956. On June 26, 1958, López hit three home runs in a game against the Washington Senators. During his career with the Athletics, he hit [...]278 with 67 home runs and 269 RBIs, and scored 298 runs. However, his talents were wasted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> never finished above 6th place. On May 26, 1959, he was traded with Ralph Terry to the New York Yankees for Johnny Kucks, Tom Sturdivant, and Jerry Lumpe. [...] For all his offensive skills, López led American League third basemen in errors in each of his four full seasons in Kansas City.|$|E

Conacher recorded 68 points while his 26 goals were good enough for second in the league. Additionally, he was named to the first All-Star team at left wing and played in the 1949 All-Star Game. He remained among the league's scoring leaders in 1949–50 as his 56 points were sixth-best in the league. He followed that up by leading the Black Hawks in goals (26) and points (50) in 1950–51. Conacher scored his 200th career goal during the season, at the time a rare feat for an NHL player. However, the physical toll of the sport caught up to him; after playing 12 games of the 1951–52 season, he opted to retire from the NHL. [...] Chicago replaced him with his nephew, Pete Conacher.|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{accepted}} a basketball scholarship {{to play at}} the University of Arizona. Wildcats head coach Lute Olson said of Lofton, [...] "He's quick and a great leaper." [...] At one point Lofton performed a 360-degree slam dunk for his unsuspecting teammates. For the Wildcats, Lofton was the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
