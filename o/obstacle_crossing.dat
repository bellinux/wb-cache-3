40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{limitations}} in function and adjustment strategies in lower limb amputees during <b>obstacle</b> <b>crossing.</b> DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SUBJECTS: Transfemoral and transtibial amputees and able-bodied control subjects. METHODS: In a motion analysis laboratory unimpeded and <b>obstacle</b> <b>crossing</b> runs were performed. The subjects stepped over an obstacle of 0. 1 m height and thickness and 1 m width. Outcome measures were gait velocity, hip, knee and ankle joint angles and leading limb preference. RESULTS: Whereas able-bodied and transtibial subjects demonstrated {{an increase in}} knee flexion during <b>obstacle</b> <b>crossing</b> compared to unimpeded walking, in transfemoral amputees the opposite was seen, namely a decrease in knee flexion. The lack of knee strategy in transfemoral amputees was compensated by circumduction at the hip on the prosthetic side and plantar flexion of the non-affected ankle. Transtibial amputees preferred to cross the obstacle with the prosthetic limb first, while transfemoral amputees preferred the non-affected limb. CONCLUSION: The different leading limb strategy in transfemoral and transtibial amputees {{could be explained by}} the restricted flexion and propulsion properties of the prosthetic knee.

40|$|Abstract — Automated {{emergency}} maneuvering {{systems can}} avoid or reduce {{the severity of}} collisions by taking control of a vehicle away from the driver during high-risk situations. The choice of when to switch to emergency control is challenging {{in the presence of}} uncertain information (imperfect sensors, road conditions, uncertain object behavior, etc.) and many dynamic obstacles. This paper considers longitudinal collision avoidance problems for a vehicle traveling along a known path. A probabilistic decision threshold framework is presented in which the user’s control is overridden if the probability that it would lead the system into an unsafe state exceeds some threshold. We apply the technique to collision imminent braking for obstacles traveling along the vehicle’s path, and present preliminary results extending the technique to the scenario of <b>obstacles</b> <b>crossing</b> the vehicle’s path.
