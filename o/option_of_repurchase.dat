5000|$|Comments by opponents: House Joint Resolution No. 30 {{would give}} {{property}} owners a financial windfall because selling property to previous property owners {{at the price}} the governmental entity paid for that property does not account for: (1) any increased value in the property; (2) property taxes and other maintenance costs for the property that have accrued between the time the property was acquired and the time a condition was met for repurchase; and (3) the cost, including the cost for bonds and enhancing the property, paid by the governmental entity for the property. The proposed amendment also would create a disincentive for a property owner to negotiate a deal with a governmental entity because the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> is only available to a property owner whose property was condemned by eminent domain, not to an owner who negotiated {{a deal with the}} governmental entity in a voluntary transaction.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} {{signaling}} and wealth transfer hypotheses around the announcement <b>of</b> share <b>repurchases</b> using a recent and larger sample of data than previously examined while employing a methodology {{designed to enhance}} the power of our tests. Disentangling the wealth transfer and signaling hypotheses is difficult; they {{are not mutually exclusive}} and can have opposite effects for bondholders. Wealth transfers decrease bondholder wealth while positive signals increase it; the combined result obscures tests of each hypothesis. By focusing on sub-samples where signaling is more and less likely to be present we increase our ability to isolate the separate effects. In addition to traditional tests of wealth effects, we feature information inherent in the correlation of wealth changes to equity and debt. Our results are generally consistent with the positive signaling effect <b>of</b> stock <b>repurchases,</b> but also provide some support for wealth transfer. Our work also emphasizes the importance of trying to disentangle the various hypotheses. In the subset <b>of</b> <b>option</b> funding <b>repurchases,</b> where signaling effects are less likely, the positive correlation of wealth changes between stockholders and bondholders is completely eliminated.

40|$|This paper re-examines the {{evidence}} on open market share repurchase activity reported by Rau and Vermaelen (2002) for the UK. Using data from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC), Rau and Vermaelen conclude that the level <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity is trivial. They attribute the low repurchase volume to regulatory restrictions that limit companies' ability {{to take advantage of}} an undervalued stock price and conclude that the bulk <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity that does occur is driven by the desire to generate tax credits for pension funds. Using data collected from a variety of sources, we find that the SDC substantially understates UK open market buyback activity.

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the results of {{empirical}} studies {{on the evolution of}} abnormal rates of return on undervalued shares of Polish public companies on notice <b>of</b> planned <b>repurchases</b> <b>of</b> these securities. The study assumed a signaling hypothesis, which states that the share repurchasing may be used by managers as a tool for sending information to the market about undervaluation of these assets. This hypothesis seems to be justified in terms of signaling theory and the theory of information asymmetry. This article is divided into two main parts.

40|$|Recent {{research}} into experiential {{services such as}} extreme sports and fine arts {{has focused on the}} subjective attributes of the encounter, with emotion as the key driver of consumption and with little attention paid to purchase intention. As repurchase intention is acknowledged as driving profitability and sustainability, it is essential that we understand its role and its relationship to both subjective attributes and utilitarian aspects. Since little work has been conducted in the arts specific to repurchase intention, this exploratory study used 26 in-depth interviews to identify the key drivers <b>of</b> <b>repurchase.</b> By identifying the roles of attributes such as emotion, value, service quality, and satisfaction and how these interact within the service encounter, the study enhances our {{understanding of the nature of}} a performing arts encounter and how to position it for maximum repeat patronage. The article concludes with a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> intention in the performing arts that can serve as a foundation for future research. The findings suggest that goal-directed emotion is a weak driver <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> intention, existing only in a small segment of highly involved frequent attendees.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} effects <b>of</b> stock <b>repurchase</b> annnouncements {{on the value of}} the announcing {{insurance}} firms and on the value of rival insurance firms. We find that insurance firms experience a significant increase in value at the time <b>of</b> the announce-ment. <b>Repurchasing</b> firms continue to earn excess returns for several months after the announcement. We study the intra-industry effect of the announcements and find that there is a significant decrease in value of rival insurance firms. This suggests that perceived changes in the competitive positions <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing</b> firms occur at the expense of rival firms and dominate any signals of favorable industry conditions. Cross-sectional tests show that the increase in the value <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing</b> firms is related to the relative size of the buyback, stock returns prior to the announcement, and the market-to-book ratio.

40|$|Abstract: The {{announcement}} <b>of</b> a share <b>repurchase</b> {{provides a}} firm’s management {{with the opportunity}} to communicate with existing and potential shareholders. Our results indicate that voluntary information disclosed by management in an insurance compa-ny’s repurchase announcement concerning the future prospects of the firm has little marginal impact on the market’s reaction to the repurchase announcement. The one exception is management statements indicating that the <b>repurchase</b> <b>of</b> common shares represents a good investment for the firm. In contrast, our results indicate that information disclosed by management about the details <b>of</b> the <b>repurchase</b> program does have a marginal impact on the market’s reaction to the repurchase announcement. For example, if the firm’s management mentions the method <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> there is an increase in the market’s reaction to the announcement, regardless of the method.

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{regression}} discontinuity design {{to identify the}} real effects <b>of</b> share <b>repurchases</b> on other firm outcomes. The probability <b>of</b> share <b>repurchases</b> that increase earnings per share (EPS) is sharply higher for firms that would have just missed the EPS forecast in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>repurchase,</b> when compared with firms that “just beat ” the EPS forecast. This discontinuity allows us to measure the causal effect <b>of</b> <b>repurchases</b> on other corporate policies in a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) framework. EPS-motivated repurchases are associated with reductions in employment and investment {{and a decrease in}} financial slack in the four quarters following the repurchase. Our evidence suggests that managers are willing to trade off investments and employment for stock repurchases that allow them to meet analyst EPS forecasts.
