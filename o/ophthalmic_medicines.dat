5000|$|Deval {{is largely}} remembered for his written works on <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine,</b> in particular, the 1844 [...] "Traité de Chirurgie Oculaire", {{which was only}} the second French work devoted {{exclusively}} to eye surgery. This book was important because it helped introduce German and Austrian ophthalmic practices into French medicine. Prior to this publication, descriptions regarding methods of ophthalmological surgery practiced in these countries were not yet available in the French language. This book {{was a result of}} Deval's studies in Vienna with Friedrich Jäger von Jaxtthal (1784-1871) and Anton von Rosas (1791-1855). Included in his treatise were explanations of medical innovations developed by German surgeons Louis Stromeyer (1804-1876) and Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847).Another important written work by Deval was the 1862 [...] "Traité théorique et pratique des maladies des yeux", which was a treatise on diseases of the eye, and a culmination of his experiences working with over 20,000 cases in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine.</b> (Note: Deval's treatise is {{not to be confused with}} Louis-Auguste Desmarres' 1847 [...] "Traité théorique et pratique des maladies des yeux").|$|R

50|$|Chau {{was born}} in 1903 in Hong Kong. He was educated at the St. Stephen's College and entered the University of Hong Kong in 1918. After he {{graduated}} in medicine in 1924, he went abroad for further study in Vienna and London, where he obtained the Diploma in <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery and Diploma in Laryngology and Otology. He returned to Hong Kong to practise with those specialist qualifications. He was well-versed in healing eye, ear, and throat.|$|R
5000|$|Himly was {{a pioneer}} in the field of ophthalmology, and is {{credited}} for introducing the scientific application of mydriatics into European medicine. In addition, he performed early investigations involving the possibilities of corneal grafting. In 1802, with Johann Adam Schmidt (1759-1809), he began publication of [...] "Ophthalmologische Bibliothek", a journal that became the first magazine dedicated to <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine</b> in Germany. From 1809 until 1814, he published the [...] "Journal für praktische Heilkunde" [...] with Christoph Hufeland.|$|R
50|$|In 1812 Beer was {{appointed}} to the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Vienna. In 1818 he suffered a stroke which left him incapacitated and eventually led to his death three years later. During his career he sought to liberate ophthalmology from dogmatic beliefs held at the time, and to establish ophthalmology on a foundation of careful observation. His best written work was the celebrated Lehre von den Augenkrankheiten, als Leitfaden zu seinen öffentlichen Vorlesungen entworfen, which was used as an important reference in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine</b> for many years afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|He {{performed}} pioneer {{research of}} iritis, and in 1801 {{was the author}} of a significant work on the disorder titled Über Nachstaar und Iritis nach Staaroperationen (On Post-Cataract and Inflammation of the Iris following Cataract Surgery). In 1802, together with Karl Gustav Himly (1772-1837) he founded Ophthalmologische Bibliothek, which was the first German magazine of <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine.</b> In 1811 his Lehrbuch der Materia Medica was published posthumously, which was a work on medicinal plants and their properties. In this book the term [...] "pharmacognosy" [...] is originally coined.|$|R
50|$|In India, after {{completing}} MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience {{is in the}} form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmological Society and various state-level ophthalmological societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{he served}} as a Regimental Medical Officer and general duty officer with the Royal Malta Artillery, and later as trainee {{ophthalmic}} specialist stationed at the Military Hospital, Mtarfa. In {{the early days of the}} War, he narrowly escaped with his life when a bomb fell at Fort Saint Elmo, demolishing a substantial part of the army barracks to which he had been posted. In 1946, he obtained a diploma in Ophthalmology from the University of Oxford, followed by a diploma in <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery from the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was a clinical assistant at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.|$|R
50|$|He edited James's book on Arterial and Secondary Haemorrhage in 1805 and John Cunningham Saunders on Diseases of the Eye in 1811. He also {{edited the}} Journal of Morbid Anatomy, <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Pharmaceutical Analysis. He himself wrote The Morbid Anatomy of the Liver, London, 1812-1815, and Pathological Researches on Malformations of the Human Heart, London, 1814. This work {{contains}} {{an account of}} nearly all the cases recorded in England up to its date, and of several observed by the author. His specimens, with others, illustrative of other parts of morbid anatomy, were preserved in the museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, {{to which they were}} presented by his sons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other cause}} to which Trevor-Roper devoted himself was {{better access to}} <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine,</b> both in the United Kingdom and in African countries. He campaigned {{successfully}} for the repeal of British laws which prevented the sale of cheap spectacles, against {{the resistance of the}} opticians' lobby. In 1983, he helped finance Peter Risdon in his successful challenge to the opticians' monopoly in the UK, a challenge that led directly to the legalisation of the sale of reading glasses without prescription. He founded the Haile Selassie Eye Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and assisted in the founding of similar hospitals in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Hobart to {{merchant}} Clyde Hamilton and Beatrice Lilian, née Paxton. He attended Leslie House School in Hobart before studying at the University of Sydney, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine in 1924. After studying <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine</b> in England at the Royal College of Physicians and Oxford University (1928 - 29), he returned to Tasmania to set up his own practice. He was also honorary or consulting ophthalmic surgeon to the Royal Hobart Hospital, the Queen Alexandra Hospital for Women and the Royal Tasmanian Society for the Blind and Deaf. In 1937, Hamilton and Dr W. D. Counsell presented a paper on hereditary eye disease and proposed remedies to the National Health and Medical Research Council, which was awarded the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital's Gifford Edmunds prize. In 1940 he published A Guide to Ophthalmic Operations.|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{travelled}} to Cork in 1835, {{and for a}} time he {{engaged in}} medical practice there, devoting himself chiefly to diseases of the eye and ear. In 1835, he made the discovery of the germinal vesicle in the mammalian ovum, and in 1837, described the origin of the chorion. [...] In 1837 he visited the principal universities of the Continent, and settled in London in the following year, where he set up practice as an oculist. In 1847, Jones examined a primitive ophthalmoscope devised by Charles Babbage, but found it of little value. [...] In 1851, Jones was appointed Professor of <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery at University College, London. He occupied this post for 30 years until the beginning of 1881, when medical problems forced him to retire to Ventnor. He stayed in Ventnor until his death in 1891.|$|R
25|$|A year later, {{buoyed by}} {{excellent}} results {{and a silver}} medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating {{the existence of a}} hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.|$|R
40|$|Mitomycin (mitomycin C; MMC) is an {{antibiotic}} isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus.

It {{is widely used}} systemically {{for the treatment of}} malignancies, and has gained popularity as topical adjunctive therapy in ocular and adnexal surgery over the past 2 decades. In <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine,</b> it is principally used to inhibit the wound healing response and reduce scarring of surgically fashioned ostia. Hence, it has been used as adjunctive therapy in various ocular surgeries, such as glaucoma filtering surgeries, dacryocystorhinostomy, corneal refractive surgery and surgeries for ocular cicatrisation. In addition, it has been used as an adjunct in the surgical management of pterygia, ocular surface squamous neoplasia, primary acquired melanosis with atypia and conjunctival melanoma.

40|$|Purpose. We {{examined}} the incidence, management, and outcomes of patients {{known to be}} at high cardiovascular risk, and to assess whether specialist referral to an ophthalmic medical clinic is worthwhile. Methods. Patients in the East Birmingham area with cholesterolembolus who were identified on digital diabetic retinopathy screening over a 3 -year period were referred to a specialist <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine</b> clinic within Heart of England NHS Trust for management and investigation. Results. A total of 33 patients were referred for clinical management. (male:female = 22 : 11, mean age 72 years). A total of 28 patients {{were known to be}} receiving medication: 14 anti hypertensive therapy(42 %), 19 aspirin (59 %), and 21 statin (64 %). A total of 18 patients had known cardiovascular disease, 10 of whom had received carotid stenting or coronary artery bypass surgery. Ten patients diagnosed with embolus required and consented to carotid Doppler studies. Six patients were confirmed with significant carotid stenosis and 2 (6 %) of these patients required carotid endarterectomy surgery. Overall, 4 patients died, a mortality rate of 12 % over 3 years. Conclusions. Annual diabetic retinopathy screening provide sopportunistic identification of asymptomatic cholesterol emboli and provides an opportunity for review of medical management in the high-risk patient group with appropriate identification and referral for carotid stenosis surgery. A total of 11 patients were identified with sub optimal cardiovascular risk management: e. g., statin use...|$|R

Methods: We studied 24 eyes of 16 patients with band-shaped keratopathy who underwent EDTA chelation treatment from April 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012. We compared preoperative and 1 month postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and corneal curvature radius (K 1, horizontal meridian; K 2, vertical meridian; Km, average of K 1 and K 2). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine the significance of differences. Results: There was a significant difference in preoperative and postoperative logMAR best corrected visual acuity (P= 0. 01). There were no significant differences in preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure (P= 0. 24) or corneal curvature radius (K 1, P= 0. 54; K 2, P= 0. 49; Km, P= 0. 45). Conclusion: After 2 % EDTA chelation treatment, post-operative logMAR best corrected visual acuity improved significantly. Moreover, since there was no significant difference in corneal curvature radius, there was little influence on corneal surface form. We believe that the results of our 2 % EDTA chelation treatment were comparable with results obtained with 3. 75 % EDTA chelation treatment in previous reports. Two percent EDTA chelation is an effective treatment for band-shaped keratopathy and a useful method for any institution.

Methods: A comparative interventional study of  25  eyes from  22  patients with macular edema (DME group:  12  eyes; BRVOME group:  13  eyes) who underwent IVB. Mean blur rate (MBR) was measured in the retinal artery, retinal vein, optic nerve head (ONH), and choroid before and after IVB. Results: In the BRVOME group, {{there was no significant}} change in MBR in the retinal artery, retinal vein or ONH, but choroidal MBR decreased significantly (P= 0. 04). In the DME group, the MBR in the retinal artery, retinal vein, ONH, and choroid decreased significantly (P= 0. 02, P= 0. 04, P< 0. 001, and P= 0. 04, respectively). In the DME group, pre-IVB MBR in the ONH was significantly correlated with post-IVB foveal thickness (R= - 0. 71, P= 0. 002). There was no such correlation in the BRVOME group in the ONH. Conclusion: IVB had a suppressive effect on circulation in eyes with DME but not in those with BRVOME. This suggests that this noninvasive and objective biomarker may be a useful part of pre-IVB evaluations and decision-making in DME.

50|$|MacLaren is {{described}} as 'one of the stars' of the developing inter-disciplinary field of <b>ophthalmic</b> translational <b>medicine</b> (TM). This combines practical skills in eye surgery with clinical academic application in research, to investigate the diseases of the eye 'from bench to bedside': aiming to improve patient outcomes, at least by arresting or slowing the progress of a disease, or - ideally - by reversing the effects, partially or totally. Once the processes of the diseases are understood, new surgical technologies are furthering the options for a surgical solution and new ophthalmic technologies have created a variety of implants, such as electronic retinal devices for prosthesis. Furthermore, the enhanced precision of surgery allows additional interventions, with the application of gene therapy and stem-cell therapy to retinal dystrophies (inherited conditions).|$|R
40|$|Emulsions {{constitute}} {{a wide range}} of natural as well as processed products. Pharmaceutical applications of emulsions include oral administration, parenteral delivery, <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>medicine,</b> topical and transdermal creams, and fluorocarbon-in-water emulsions for blood oxygenation. In the foods area many of the products like mayonnaise, margarine, ice-creams are emulsions by nature and some products can also be used for delivery of active ingredients (e. g. nutraceuticals) with potential health benefits. Emulsions are also encountered at many stages of petroleum recovery, transportation, and processing. Typically, emulsions are manufactured in a two-step process. First a coarse emulsion called a premix is made which is passed through a high-pressure homogenizer. Intense energy supplied in the high pressure homogenizer causes breakage of the coarse emulsion to a fine one with a tighter distribution. ^ Population balance equation (PBE) models are useful for emulsions since they allow prediction of the evolution of the drop size distribution on specification of the two rate processes i. e., breakage of drops due to the flow field and coalescence of colliding drops. In our work, we developed a PBE model to describe emulsion breakage in a high pressure homogenizer. The focus of the work was breakage and conditions to keep coalescence to minimum were implemented. Two breakage rates representing two mechanisms i. e., turbulent inertial and turbulent viscous breakage were necessary for reproducing the bimodal nature of the distributions. We used mechanistic functions in the PBE model to develop a predictive model which could be extended to changes in formulation variables as well as process variables. Starting with the assumption of binary breakage, the model was refined to include multiple drop breakage. The developed model was found to be extensible to reasonable changes in oil concentration, surfactant concentration, continuous phase viscosity and constant ratio of oil to surfactant. Anomalies in pressure prediction encountered earlier were also corrected for by including some additional features like heating, maximum stable diameter, and number of daughter drops. A preliminary attempt was also made to use the developed model for designing experiments for making target emulsions with pre-specified properties. ...|$|R

Additionally, to determine details of the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of bilberry extract anthocyanins and the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression in the mouse retina. Materials and methods: Anthocyanins in bilberry extract (100 mg/kg/day or 500 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The expression levels of various molecular chaperones were assessed with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RGC survival was evaluated by measuring the gene expression of RGC markers and counting retrogradely labeled RGCs after optic nerve crush. Results: The protein levels of Grp 78 and Grp 94 increased significantly in mice after bilberry extract administration. Increased Grp 78 and Grp 94 levels were detected in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the retina, surrounding the RGCs. Gene expression of Chop, Bax, and Atf 4 increased in mice after optic nerve crush and decreased significantly after oral bilberry extract administration. RGC survival after nerve crush also increased with bilberry extract administration. Conclusion: These results indicate that oral bilberry extract administration suppresses RGC death. Bilberry extract administration increased Grp 78 and Grp 94 protein levels, an effect which may underlie the neuroprotective effect of bilberry extract after optic nerve crush. Thus, bilberry extract has a potential role in neuroprotective treatments for retinal injuries, such as those which occur in glaucoma.

40|$|The {{combination}} of glass vial, elastomeric stopper, and aluminum crimp seal {{represents one of}} the principal packaging systems used to package diagnostic reagents, <b>ophthalmic</b> and veterinary <b>medicines,</b> and pharmaceutical products. This work states that elastomeric flat liners are an alternative to traditional stoppers. To confirm this position, several comparative moisture transmission evaluations are conducted to contrast the barrier performance of glued flat liners against stoppers in continuous thread closures on glass vials. After a review of several standard packaging integrity testing methods, this thesis demonstrates the use of coulometric titration as an alternative package system testing methodology. Coulometric titrators are commercially available, and coulometric titration is well established as a precise moisture determination method for determining the micro-moisture contents in both solid and liquid products. The accuracy of coulometric titration technique is well suited for discerning the slight changes in moisture content of hygroscopic products after being packaged in candidate high moisture barrier packaging systems...|$|R
