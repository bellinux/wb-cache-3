40|$|Liabilities can be {{guaranteed}} {{by a third}} party. Guarantees are arrangements whereby the guarantor commits to pay or assume the liability of another entity (the original debtor) if certain conditions are met (such as inability of the original debtor to pay). Guarantees may include repayments of principal and/or interest payments. A debt guarantee involves three institutional units: original creditor, original debtor, and guarantor. Activation of a debt guarantee creates a new liability and the guarantor now becomes the new debtor. This raises issues on how to treat flows between the original debtor and creditor and between the original debtor and the guarantor (the new debtor). Activation of guarantees affects transactions or <b>other</b> <b>economic</b> <b>flows.</b> Usual cases of guarantees in terms of institutional units involved and motivations may be: (1) government providing guarantees for borrowing by public enterprises or private enterprises (for example, to encourage certain types of activities), (2) financial intermediaries providing guarantees as services for payment of a fee, and (3) parents providing guarantees for their subsidiaries (for example, to cut interest costs). The treatment of flows arising from an activation of guarantees may also need to conside...|$|E
40|$|The {{main issue}} is how {{interest}} accruals should be determined for each accounting period when principal is indexed. An internal working group of the IMF Statistics Department has reviewed the treatment of interest for index-linked debt instruments denominated in domestic currency and offered a clarification on the calculation of interest for these instruments within the existing 1993 SNA concept of interest (the STA position paper is attached). A summary is presented below. The BOPTEG issues paper # 25 presents the IMF Statistics Department’s proposal that debt instruments with both principal and coupons linked to a foreign currency be classified and treated {{as though they are}} denominated in that foreign currency. Following that proposal, all other types of index-linked instruments, except those denominated in a foreign currency but including those that are partially linked to exchange rates (for example, those for which only principal or only coupons are linked to an exchange rate), would be treated as being denominated in domestic currency for the recording of interest and <b>other</b> <b>economic</b> <b>flows.</b> I.

40|$|Global {{economy has}} been marked by ever more dynamic changes in the volume and {{structure}} of international <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> and of world economy in general. Due to these changes, only the countries that successfully adjust to the modern international specialisation framework are particularly favoured. The development of new technologies involves an essential change of the principle of division of labour not only within companies, between them but also among national economies.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{shows that}} there is a strong bond between the {{globalization}} phenomenon, state sovereignty decline and the conformation of the 2007 / 2008 economic crisis. In this sense, this paper underlines that state sovereignty weakening increased the global <b>economic</b> <b>flow.</b> Hence, the paper emphasizes the need to create a global economic governance system and therefore highlights the importance of setting up rules and approaches for market regulation and to let the control of the global <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> more effective. Finally, this paper advocates that this global economic governance system shall be based on a multilateral schedule and represent the interests of states, populations and markets...|$|R

40|$|Is world-systems {{analysis}} of any relevance to present-day <b>economic</b> <b>flows?</b> By using methods {{in line with}} the world-system and dependence theories, we show that <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> - trade and foreign direct investment - still deeply separate core and peripheries. On the one hand, through the {{analysis of}} the trade by products, we show that core countries hold on to a higher position in the international division of labour. On the other hand, by using network method, we highlight that core countries are still characterized by the intensity of their reciprocal relations while peripheral countries have few economic relations with a limited number of core countries. Moreover, the article demonstrates that this core-periphery division of the world has not lost its pertinence; it is as relevant as {{at the end of the}} sixties. In the current era of globalization, <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> are still deeply structured by basic power relations between core and peripheries. However, the article also develops a theoretical framework to understand dynamics of the world-system and insists on the emergence of Eastern Asia as a new core area, notably by showing the rising position of some East Asian countries in the international division of labour. We conclude by underlying the necessity to integrate world-system and global network theoretical frameworks. © The authors 2012 Geografiska Annaler: Series B © 2012 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.

40|$|Every {{tight gas}} well {{needs to be}} stimulated with a {{hydraulic}} fracture treatment to produce natural gas at <b>economic</b> <b>flow</b> rates and recover a volume of gas that provides an acceptable return on investment. Over the past few decades, {{many different types of}} fracture fluids, propping agents and treatment sizes have been tried in the Cotton Valley formation. The treatment design engineer has to choose the optimum fluid, optimum proppant, optimum treatment size and make sure the optimum treatment is mixed and pumped in the field. These optimum values also depend on drilling costs, fracturing costs and <b>other</b> <b>economic</b> parameters; such as gas prices, operating costs and taxes. Using information from the petroleum literature, numerical and analytical simulators, and statistical analysis of production data, this research provides a detailed economic evaluation of the Cotton Valley wells drilled in the Elm Grove field operated by Matador Resources to determine not only the optimum treatment type, but also the optimum treatment volume as a function of drilling costs, completion costs, operating costs and gas prices.
