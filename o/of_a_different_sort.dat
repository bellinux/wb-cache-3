25|$|Of the 22 awards, 14 were direct {{awards and}} eight were Empire Gallantry Medal (two) and Albert Medal (six) {{exchange}} awards. Four awards {{were to the}} Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve {{who served in the}} extremely dangerous role of mine disposal during the Second World War. Courage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> was displayed by two prisoners of war who endured terrible suffering without flinching, with Private Horace William Madden dying of privations while assisting fellow prisoners, and Captain Lionel Colin Matthews eventually being executed by his captors for building a resistance network. The last Australian to be awarded the GC (in 1978) was Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt of the Victoria Police, Melbourne, for arresting two armed bank robbers in June 1976.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, {{it made me feel}} a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Musical Direction, but the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) neglected to include the title on the ballots for Emmy nominations in 2002. NATAS attempted to remedy this by mailing a postcard informing its voters {{that it should be}} included, but the episode did not win. NATAS' oversight, according to the Washington Post, was [...] "another example of the lack of industry respect afforded one of television's most consistently clever shows". Ogle in The Miami Herald vigorously protests this omission, writing, [...] "he most astonishing, entertaining hour (hour plus, actually) of TV in the past year slips by virtually unnoticed. Nothing here is real; nothing here is right. Buffy the Vampire Slayers musical episode, 'Once More, with Feeling', registers a paltry outstanding music direction nomination. Nice for the musical directors. A stake through the aspirations of writer/director Joss Whedon, the beating creative heart of Buffy, the only TV writer brave and clever enough to use horror as one great big wonderful metaphor for growing up 'Once More, with Feeling' is TV <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort,</b> something that comes along once in a lifetime and should not be buried but celebrated and rewarded." [...] The episode was also nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award, both given for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. In 2009 TV Guide ranked the episode #14 on its list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|As {{pointed out}} by Lawrence B. Mohr, the early theorists of {{organizational}} structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber [...] "saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered a matter of choice... When in the 1930s, the rebellion began {{that came to be}} known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition." [...] However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is [...] "an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Navy's most {{critical}} struggle {{in this war}} was the Battle of the Atlantic, the defence of Britain's vital Atlantic supply lines against U-boat attack. While a convoy system was instituted {{from the start of}} the war, German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by [...] "wolf-packs", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by the deployment of purpose-built escorts, of escort carriers, of long-range patrol aircraft and of improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of Bletchley Park. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort,</b> against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in the Arctic, where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on sustaining the key British outpost of Malta.|$|E

2500|$|However, for his contemporaries, {{the ideas}} {{presented}} by Copernicus were not markedly {{easier to use}} than the geocentric theory and did not produce more accurate predictions of planetary positions. Copernicus was aware of this and could not present any observational [...] "proof", relying instead on arguments about {{what would be a}} more complete and elegant system. The Copernican model appeared to be contrary to common sense and to contradict the Bible. Tycho Brahe's arguments against Copernicus are illustrative of the physical, theological, and even astronomical grounds on which heliocentric cosmology was rejected. [...] Tycho, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, appreciated the elegance of the Copernican system, but objected {{to the idea of a}} moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The Aristotelian physics of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, but could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> of substance called aether that moved naturally. [...] So Tycho said that the Copernican system “... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.” Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Copernicus had assumed in order to explain why the Earth's motion produced no visible changes in the appearance of the fixed stars (known as annual stellar parallax). Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory– see stellar magnitude), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (the size of Earth's orbit or larger, and thus much larger than the sun). Regarding this Tycho wrote, “Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [...] by inference.” He said his Tychonic system, which incorporated Copernican features into a geocentric system, “offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture”. Thus many astronomers accepted some aspects of Copernicus's theory at the expense of others. [...] His model did have a large influence on later scientists such as Galileo and Johannes Kepler, who adopted, championed and (especially in Kepler's case) sought to improve it. However, in the years following publication of de Revolutionibus, for leading astronomers such as Erasmus Reinhold, the key attraction of Copernicus's ideas was that they reinstated the idea of uniform circular motion for the planets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a novel approach}} to learning phonological hidden structure relying on underexplored expectation driven learning strategies rooted in the machine learning literature. A novel probabilistic grammatical representation that enables estimation of expectation driven learning updates, and two learning algorithms utilizing these updates, are introduced.

The paper then shows that the learning strategies are fully general and can also be successfully applied to learning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entirely <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hidden structure created by unknown underlying representations...|$|R
