40|$|Greece {{is a major}} {{international}} <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> producer. <b>Olive</b> <b>oil</b> varieties constitute the major crops for Greek farmers growing certain oriental <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> varieties. Currently, the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> sector in Greece is undergoing substantial changes and the response of farmers and consumers to {{this will be a}} vital factor in its success. Throughout the application of the common agriculture policy (CAP), mechanisms, such as production aid, subsidies and marketing orders, were employed to support both producers and consumers. A possible reform of CAP aimed at eliminating or reducing production aid or any kind of subsidies could have a considerable effect on producer and consumer marketing behaviour. In this study a formulated mathematical problem for the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> sector on the island of Crete based on the welfare concept and the simulation of the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> market equilibrium, subject to specified policy interventions and circumstances was adopted. According to the results obtained, it was concluded that future <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> policies should not impinge on mechanisms that influence <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>farmers</b> and consumer behaviour but should emphasize the greater cost effectiveness of production and marketing policies...|$|R
40|$|Small farms {{have the}} option of {{competing}} in the global market by pursuing a niche brand differentiation strategy. However, they usually face tight financial constraints when attempting to build a food brand that meets both the desires of a small segment of distant final consumers and the requirements of its international buyers. In this study, we explore how small farms can use social networks to start transacting with international buyers and to build global niche brands. Following a 'grounded theory' approach, we analyzed the evidence collected from 34 cases of small farms producing single-estate extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and other specialty food products in Italy. The analysis led to the following conclusions. First, small <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>farmers</b> can build brand associations and perceived brand quality, and ultimately brand equity, by developing social ties with third-party endorsers that are outside the product supply chain but have high status in the market. Second, to intentionally develop these social ties, small <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>farmers</b> need to obtain information both on (a) international consumer preferences for <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> attributes and (b) which actors have the high status to endorse and promote the individual brands. Third, use of social ties with high-status endorsers for brand development is more effective when international consumers' familiarity with the product is lower and their preference for credence attributes stronger. While concerning a developed country that moreover enjoys a strong reputation in relation to the product, we posit that this study is rich with lessons for small producers of specialty food in both developed and developing regions whose reputations associated with the specific products are high. From a policy perspective, this study suggests that public market development programs can play a key facilitation role for the development of social networks linking small companies and international buyers by providing relevant market information on third-party endorsers as well as final consumers and buyers.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of the 2003 CAP reform on the production of Italian <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> controlling for the regional differences in <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> production {{as well as for}} the differences between years. Italian <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> production time series data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network for the 2000 - 2010 period at regional level is used to examine the effect of the 2003 Fischler reform on the production of <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Production costs and payments received by farmers to support their income are considered. The data were collected at micro level based on a sample of farms representative of the production systems in the country. In order to consider the differences in production among the regions, eight representative regions in terms of surveyed farms are considered: Liguria, Toscana, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Puglia and Sicilia. We found that the most important factors affecting the production of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> are the area under olive groves and labour productivity. Results also show no evidence that the level of payments have an impact to the level of production, however, the type of payments has. Future work should explore the impact of the 2003 reform into the technical and production efficiency of the Italian <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>farmers.</b> It would be interesting to link the measures introduced by the cross compliance and the management practices of the different farms to have a more complete picture of the various parameters influencing the production of <b>olive</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R

Mia starts to worry she isn't enough of a party girl. She even (as a last resort, of course) asks her archenemy, Lana Weinberger, how {{to act like a}} [...] "Party Girl". Mia does what Lana says and it all ends in tragedy. After she drinks and 'sexy dances' with J.P., her relationship with Michael seems to be on rocky ground, especially as Michael's parents are splitting up and he is being an absent boyfriend. Her friendship with J.P. seems to be going the same way thanks to Lilly's new literary magazine, 'Fat Louie's Pink Butthole', which includes 'No More Corn!' a story Mia wrote (before meeting him) about J.P. killing himself. However, Principal Gupta immediately bans the magazine and confiscates all the copies, as Lilly has submitted five explicit stories to it, meaning that J.P. never sees Mia's story. The play is performed at the Aide de Ferme, a benefit for Genovian <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>farmers</b> that Grandmere puts on. Everyone who is anyone attends, but, before the last scene, Mia is worried about her on-stage kiss with J.P. But then Michael shows up in J.P.'s costume and gives her a perfect kiss and they talk about their problems, and, once again, their relationship appears to be strong. Grandmere also raises enough money to help the Genovian farmers and Mia, solving her problems.|$|R
40|$|Under {{the past}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> subsidy regime, <b>farmers</b> were {{eligible}} for subsidies {{on the basis of}} the amount of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> they produced. This led to an intensification of production, particularly on flat land, and had in most cases negative environmental effects, such as more soil erosion on sloping land and more pollution. With the decoupling of agricultural support under the newly established rules of the CAP, formalised in 2005, cross compliance measures have become obligatory. In this paper an ex-ante assessment is made of the application of cross compliance for soil erosion control (natural cover crops and terrace maintenance) in hilly and mountainous olive groves in Trás-os-Montes in Portugal. A linear programming model was developed to assess the various socio-economic and environmental effects of four different development scenarios for olive groves. The scenarios were developed on the basis of changing market prices, wage rates and subsidies; their effects included shifts towards intensification, abandonment and organic farming. Simulations considering a minimum return to labour constraint showed very high levels of abandonment, particularly in combination with cross compliance obligations. However, even without this minimum return to labour constraint, abandonment would reach more than 20 % in three out of the four scenarios. The model showed that cross compliance obligations could be quite effective in reducing erosion, but that they would depress income in all scenarios as a result of higher abandonment and lower percentage shifts towards intensive systems...|$|R

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value.
