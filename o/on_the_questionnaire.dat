30|$|It is {{important}} to recognize the limitations of the present study.

Therefore, to minimize this latter limitation, a pilot study was performed.|$|R

The results indicate that scores <b>on</b> both of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> assessed prior to computer implementation are reliable and valid predictors of post-implementation adaptation to the computer and perceptions of training. Scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> designed to assess specific attitudes, measured at three points in time, are also related to concurrent measures of job satisfaction and adaptation to the computer system...|$|R
