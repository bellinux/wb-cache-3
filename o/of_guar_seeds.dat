5000|$|Cyamopsis tetragonoloba grows upright, {{reaching}} a maximum height {{of up to}} 2-3 m. It has a main single stem with either basal branching or fine branching along the stem. Thanks to taproots, the guar plant can access soil moisture in low soil depths. Additionally, this legume develops root nodules with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria rhizobia in the surface part of its rooting system.Its leaves and stems are mostly hairy, dependent on the cultivar. Its fine leaves have an elongated oval shape (5 to 10 cm length) and of alternate position. Clusters of flowers grow in the plant axil and are of white to blueish color. The developing pods are rather flat and slim containing 5 to 12 small oval seeds of 5 mm length (TGW = 25-40 g). Usually, mature seeds are white or gray, but in case of excess moisture they can turn black and lose germination capacity. The chromosome number <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> <b>seeds</b> is 2n=14.The seeds of guar beans have a very remarkable characteristic. Its kernel consists of a protein-rich germ (43-46%) and a relatively large endosperm (34-40%), containing big amounts of the galactomannan. The latter is polysaccharide containing polymers of mannose and galactose in a ratio of 2:1 with many branches. Thanks to the latter, it exhibits a great hydrogen bonding activity [...] having a viscosifying effect in liquids.|$|E

Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) is a drought resistant crop grown mainly in Rajasthan and parts of Haryana and Punjab. The sowing season for <b>guar</b> <b>seed</b> begins in July and the crop is ready for harvesting in October. Most guar farmers sell their produce to traders at the farm gate and nearby markets. A part of produce is also kept by farmers for seed, animal feed and fodder purposes. India is the largest producer <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> <b>seed</b> {{in the world and}} accounts for 80 percent of the world’s total <b>guar</b> <b>seed</b> production. <b>Guar</b> gum, extracted from <b>guar</b> <b>seed,</b> is used as a thickening agent and additive in food products such as soups and ice-creams. Of late, the global demand for guar gum is growing rapidly because of its use in “hydraulic fracking ” process to extract oil and gas from shale. Almost 80 percent of country’s total production is exported to US, China and Europe.

40|$|Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.) is a {{nitrogen-fixing legume}} which resembles its relative, the soybean. Guar appears to prefer hot arid climates {{such as those}} found in Arizona.

40|$|Abstract Background Guar, Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub, is {{a member}} of the Leguminosae (Fabaceae) family and is {{economically}} the most important of the four species in the genus. The endosperm of guar seed is a rich source of mucilage or gum, which forms a viscous gel in cold water, and is used as an emulsifier, thickener and stabilizer in a wide range of foods and industrial applications. Guar gum is a galactomannan, consisting of a linear (1 → 4) -β-linked D-mannan backbone with single-unit, (1 → 6) -linked, α-D-galactopyranosyl side chains. To better understand regulation of guar seed development and galactomannan metabolism we created cDNA libraries and a resulting EST dataset from different developmental stages <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> <b>seeds.</b> Results A database of 16, 476 guar seed ESTs was constructed, with 8, 163 and 8, 313 ESTs derived from cDNA libraries I and II, respectively. Library I was constructed from seeds at an early developmental stage (15 – 25 days after flowering, DAF), and library II from seeds at 30 – 40 DAF. Quite different sets of genes were represented in these two libraries. Approximately 27 % of the clones were not similar to known sequences, suggesting that these ESTs represent novel genes or may represent non-coding RNA. The high flux of energy into carbohydrate and storage protein synthesis in guar seeds was reflected by a high representation of genes annotated as involved in signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, chaperone and proteolytic processes, and translation and ribosome structure. Guar unigenes involved in galactomannan metabolism were identified. Among the seed storage proteins, the most abundant contig represented a conglutin accounting for 3. 7 % of the total ESTs from both libraries. Conclusion The present EST collection and its annotation provide a resource for understanding guar seed biology and galactomannan metabolism. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to introduce new green, nontoxic, cost effective derivatives <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum (GG- 1). Guar gum is one of the important naturally occurring non-ionic polysaccharide which has incredible applications due to its rheological modifying properties in medicinal, pharmaceutical, food, textile, cosmetics, water treatment, mining, drilling, explosives, confectioneries and scores of other industrial and commercial sectors. Guar gum, also called guaran, is a galactomannan. It is primarily the ground endosperm <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> beans. The <b>guar</b> <b>seeds</b> are dehusked, milled and screened to obtain the guar gum. It is typically produced as a free-flowing, off-white powder. The adaptation of physical properties of GG- 1 & GG- 2 can improve and diversify its commercial applications. In this project, novel and efficient synthesis of five different new derivatives (120 - 124) <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum were done by insitu activation of cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and hydrocinnamic acid by coupling with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N, N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Effect of temperature, concentration of reactants and time interval plays important role for determining DS value <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> esters. Reaction conditions were optimized for each reaction. Antioxidant potential was examined by DPPH method. A rapid method for protecting the hydroxyl group in sterically hindered gum has been developed by using microwave assisted synthesis (MAS). A novel and efficient synthesis <b>of</b> different <b>guar</b> gum derivatives (126 - 133) such as acetate, butyrate propionate, maleate, succinate, phthalate, citraconate and glutarate have been developed by microwave irradiation. The maximum ester formation was successfully achieved in 15 minutes at 600 W by using iodine and DMAP as a reaction promoter. Gum ester formation was obtained by concentration variation at different time intervals. The products were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy and SEM. Moreover, degree of substitution was also calculated for each experiment by titration method. First time fatty acid esters (C 5 -C 18) were formulated (136 - 145) via acid chloride route. Reaction proceeded in two steps. First step involves conventional synthesis of fatty acid chlorides (135 a- 135 j) by reacting corresponding acid with slight excess of thionyl chloride (134). Second step involves esterification of free hydroxyl group of GG- 2 with acid chloride; as a result novel derivatives (136 - 145) with fascinating thickening and emulsifying properties were obtained which might be promising candidate for cosmetic and food industry. Physical properties were examined like solubility, surface morphological study, swellingbehavior, gelation index etc. Different spectroscopic techniques were used for structure elucidation. In situ hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> esters were done in DCl during NMR experiments due to the poor solubility <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> derivatives. Guar derivatives with variable degree of substitution (DS) were prepared and were confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, presence of carbonyl signal confirmed the formation <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> ester. Further structural elucidation was done by 1 H-NMR.

The magnitude of the adsorption density <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum onto the above minerals may be arranged in the following sequence: talc > graphite > mica The effect of particle size on the adsorption density <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum onto these minerals has indicated that higher adsorption takes place in the coarser size fraction, consequent to an increase in the surface face-to-edge ratio. In the case of the talc and mica samples pretreated with EDTA and the leached graphite sample, a decrease in the adsorption density <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum is observed, due to a reduction in the metallic adsorption sites.

Dissolution experiments indicate release of lattice metal ions from chalcopyrite, while co-precipitation and conductivity tests confirm guar gum-metal ion interaction in the bulk solution. The pH of maximum co-precipitation between guar gum and copper species is observed in the range 9 - 9. 5. The adsorption process is governed primarily by chemical interaction between the hydroxyl groups <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum and hydroxylated chalcopyrite apart from hydrogen bonding. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopic Studies (XPS) provide evidence in support of the interaction mechanisms proposed. Résumé —On a exécuté des études d’adsorption, d’électrocinétique et de flottation afin d’examiner –l’interaction de la gomme de guar avec la chalcopyrite. La densité d’adsorption de la gomme de guar sur la chalcopyrite montre un maximum d’adsorption faible à un pH de 9. 5. Les isothermes d’adsorptio...|$|R
40|$|Textural and sensory {{properties}} of rolls produced from semi-finished frozen products with additions <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum were assessed. A commercial wheat flour T 512, ingredients such as yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rapeseed oil, sodium chloride {{were used for}} preparing dough and final products. Guar gum and commercial additive Trial RC 2 were used as additives for production. The textural {{properties of}} rolls were measured by a TA-XT Plus Texture Analyzer. All samples were evaluated by selected assessors. A five-point hedonic scale was used for evaluation characteristics such as taste, pliancy, texture, porosity, stickiness, gumminess, crispness and quality. The obtained data showed nonsignificant difference in moisture of rolls after baking and 3 days after baking. Control sample of rolls had higher firmness in comparison to other samples with guar gum after baking. Samples of rolls with higher addition <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum (10 g. kg - 1 and 15 g. kg - 1) had less firmness in comparison to control sample and sample with 5 g. kg - 1 <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum. Sensory analysis showed negligible differences among all samples in monitored characteristics. Sensory assessors evaluated all samples as identical. Increased addition <b>of</b> <b>guar</b> gum in rolls led to the extension of shelf life (lower firmness) at unchanged sensory properties of the rolls. </span...|$|R
