Only the first and third objectives were achieved. To raise funds and to widen its appeal, the Committee published a pamphlet by D.P.

The Fund was eventually wound up in 1954, having raised £3,687 15s - over £88,000 in relative purchasing power.|$|E

He began his wushu on the Beijing Wushu Team, an athletic group organised to perform martial arts forms during the All China Games. He was coached by renowned wushu coaches Li Junfeng and Wu Bin, who made extra efforts to help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li's family {{because they could not}} afford to buy meat, which was essential for the good physical condition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>athlete.</b> As a member of the team, he received wushu training and went on to win fifteen gold medals and one silver medal in Chinese wushu championships, where, despite his young age, he competed against adults.|$|E

25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E

The statue was discovered in 1934 in Capestrano, Province of L'Aquila, Abruzzo region. It is widely considered to be an archaeological evidence of the pre-Roman settlements in Abruzzo.|$|E

However, from experience, the mental components <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> performance are overlooked; which {{is believed to}} have a greater impact on their overall performance. Using my experiences to produce <b>a</b> unique body <b>of</b> research, this thesis focusses on using the athlete’s perspective to design. This thesis investigates Sporting Facilities and Natatoriums are the focus. Using the skill of architects to create space and affect emotion, the thesis will investigate how they can be used to create an atmosphere that will allow <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> to enter the optimal emotional state to achieve a successful sporting performance. The research will look the emotion and atmosphere of architecture, and the knowledge of sports psychology to understand how atmosphere can be used to challenge current design conventions. The approach will look at the relationship of facilities with and without local community involvement when they are not being used for competitions. This allows the needs of the community which has an effect upon the design, to be controlled. Which allows for <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> perspective to drive the design. Using Natatoriums as the focus <b>of</b> the thesis, <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> design investigations will be conducted looking at how these spaces can be developed and arranged to optimise athlete performance. Objectives are to understand the arrangement of program and atmosphere required at each stage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> pre-competition process, so a facility can be developed that is biased towards <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> mental state versus other design factors...|$|R
