40|$|In the Gaussian-modulated {{coherent}} states (GMCS) quantum {{key distribution}} (QKD) protocol, Alice prepares quantum states actively: for each transmission, Alice generates a pair of Gaussian-distributed random numbers, encodes them on a weak coherent pulse using optical amplitude and phase modulators, and then transmits the Gaussian-modulated weak coherent pulse to Bob. Here we propose a passive state preparation scheme using a thermal source. In our scheme, Alice splits the output of a thermal source into two spatial modes using a beam splitter. She measures one mode locally using conjugate <b>optical</b> <b>homodyne</b> detectors, and transmits the other mode to Bob after applying appropriate optical attenuation.
