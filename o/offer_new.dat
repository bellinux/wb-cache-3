5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would <b>offer</b> <b>New</b> Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan would replace the Access to the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Once the Allies had {{combined}} their forces, the Elector and Marsin {{moved their}} 40,000 troops into the entrenched camp between Dillingen and Lauingen {{on the north}} bank of the Danube. The Allied commanders– unwilling to attack such a strong position rendered impregnable by redoubts and inundations– passed round Dillingen to the north through Balmershofen and Armerdingen {{in the direction of}} Donauwörth. If captured, the bridgehead at Donauwörth (overlooked by the Schellenberg) would <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> communications with the friendly states in central Germany by way of Nördlingen and Nuremberg, as well as providing a good crossing-place over the Danube for re-supply when the Allies were south of the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{was created by the}} Arab League in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.|$|E

5|$|The game uses {{both of the}} system's screens to <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> options. The top screen {{displays}} the normal gameplay, while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls. The overhead map {{displays the}} current course the player traverses and displays item locations. The touch controls include virtual buttons, which rotate the top screen's camera angle, and directional character controls, which can operate with either the DS stylus or the player's thumb using the DS wrist strap. In addition to the single-player adventure, the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode. Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game. All minigames use the touchscreen to play, and are based on different themes: racing, card games, puzzles, and so forth. The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green, Red, Blue and Yellow Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka)—character hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario, Luigi, or Wario. Wario can stun opponents by picking them up, swinging them, and throwing them.|$|E

25|$|After Argentina {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled {{over how to}} organize.

25|$|In 1983, the {{economic}} situation began to improve. Boeing assembled its 1,000th 737 passenger aircraft. During the following years, commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces. As passenger air traffic increased, competition was harder, mainly from Airbus, a European newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing. Boeing had to <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> aircraft, and developed the single-aisle 757, the larger, twin-aisle 767, and upgraded versions of the 737. An important project of these years was the Space Shuttle, to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era. Boeing participated also with other products in the space program, {{and was the first}} contractor for the International Space Station program.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{growth was}} uneven in the 1980s. Restructuring {{of the economy}} and the {{rebuilding}} immediately following {{the end of the civil}} war caused the GDP to rise about 5 percent in 1980 and 1981. Each year from 1984 to 1990, however, showed a drop in the GDP. Reasons for the contraction included the reluctance of foreign banks to <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> loans, the diversion of funds to fight the new insurrection against the government, and, after 1985, the total embargo on trade with the United States, formerly Nicaragua's largest trading partner. After 1985 the government chose to fill the gap between decreasing revenues and mushrooming military expenditures by printing large amounts of paper money. Inflation rose rapidly, peaking in 1988 at more than 14,000 percent annually.|$|E
25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to <b>offer</b> <b>new</b> perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E
