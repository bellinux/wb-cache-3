40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} report on {{high-quality}} amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) {{based on a}} single-source dual-layer concept processed at temperatures down to 150 °C. The dual-layer concept allows the precise control of local charge carrier densities by varying the O 2 /Ar gas ratio during sputtering for the bottom and top layers. Therefore, extensive annealing steps after the deposition can be avoided. In addition, the dual-layer concept is more robust against variation of the oxygen flow in the deposition chamber. The charge carrier density in the TFT channel is namely adjusted by varying {{the thickness of the}} two layers whereby the oxygen concentration during deposition is switched only between no oxygen for the bottom layer and very high concentration for the top layer. The dual-layer TFTs are more stable under bias conditions in comparison with single-layer TFTs processed at low temperatures.

Therefore, it is difficult in achieving effective hole doping [4]. Up to now, only a few p-type oxide materials (Cu 2 O, CuO, SnO, etc.) were proved to be suitable for TFT application [5, 6], but their performance lags far behind of n-type counterparts.
