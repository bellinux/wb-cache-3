5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of the hostage crisis, President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating the hostage crisis. Alex is hired to be a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>force</b> along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi.

Vessels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>force</b> began to depart Darwin as early as 7 January, with HMA Ships Brisbane and Stalwart the last to depart on 31 January, after command of the relief operation was turned over to the Commandant of the Army's 7th Military District.|$|E
5|$|The retreat quickly {{broke down}} into a {{confused}} and disorganized rout.

5|$|With {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{military}} {{situation for the}} German Army on the Eastern Front, it became increasingly important to interrupt the flow of supplies from the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. By December 1943, the German Army was forced into continuous retreat. The Luftwaffe had been seriously weakened by four long years of war, and increasing Allied anti-submarine capabilities were steadily degrading {{the effectiveness of the}} U-boats. The only effective weapon at the disposal of the Germans in Norway was Scharnhorst—Tirpitz was badly damaged, and the four remaining heavy cruisers were committed to the Baltic. During a conference with Hitler on 19–20 December, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz decided to employ Scharnhorst against the next Allied convoy that presented itself. Erich Bey, by now promoted to Konteradmiral, was given command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 26 March, Wichita, {{assigned}} to Task Force 39, departed the United States {{to reinforce the}} British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W.

The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised Washington, Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers.

MV Seahorse Standard recovered the remains of Trooper Joshua Porter on 5 March and the Blackhawk helicopter on 9 March, {{with the assistance of}} specialist equipment provided by the SUPSALV team.
