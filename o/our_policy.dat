Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising {{as a result of the}} desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. <b>Our</b> <b>policy</b> is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.

In order to evalaute these policies, we have formulated an application in network intrusion detection as a multi-agent monitoring problem.

Based on this evaluation, we have demonstrated that <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> can reduce both the delay and communication overhead required to detect network intrusions.

This paper introduces a general, optimization-based framework and several request distribution policies that enable multi-data-center services to manage their brown energy consumption and leverage green energy, while respecting their service-level agreements (SLAs) and minimizing energy cost. <b>Our</b> <b>policies</b> can be used to abide by caps on brown energy consumption that might arise from various scenarios such as government imposed Kyotostyle carbon limits. Extensive simulations and real experiments show that <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> allow a service to trade off consumption and cost.

[...] These comments caused a public row in Britain, and some commentators wanted the tour to be called off; the MCC informed the British government that players would be selected on ability alone and that any attempts from within South Africa to interfere would cause the tour to be cancelled. Denis Howell, the Minister for Sport, informed the House of Commons of the MCC position and stated that the government expected that the MCC would cancel the tour if any player were to be rejected. Privately, the MCC committee were unhappy to have been forced into so unequivocal a position.|$|E

[...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of monitoring applications has precipitated {{the need for}} Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) which constantly monitor incoming data feeds (through registered continuous queries), in order to detect events of interest. In this paper, we examine {{the problem of how}} to schedule multiple Continuous Queries (CQs) in a DSMS to optimize different Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. We show that, unlike traditional on-line systems, scheduling policies in DSMSs that optimize for average response time will be different from policies that optimize for average slowdown, which is a more appropriate metric to use in the presence of a heterogeneous workload. Towards this, we propose policies to optimize for the average-case performance for both metrics. Additionally, we propose a hybrid scheduling policy that strikes a fine balance between performance and fairness, by looking at both the average- and worst-case performance, for both metrics. We also show how <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> can be adaptive enough to handle the inherent dynamic nature of monitoring applications. Furthermore, we discuss how <b>our</b> <b>policies</b> can be efficiently implemented and extended to exploit sharing in optimized multi-query plans and multi-stream CQs.
