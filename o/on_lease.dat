5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft <b>on</b> <b>lease</b> for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|By 1857 a {{blast furnace}} had opened {{close to the}} Durham {{coalfield}} {{on the north side}} of the Tees. Backed by the rival West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway, the Durham & Cleveland Union Railway proposed a line from the mines in Skinningrove and Staithes, via Guisborough and a bridge over the Middlesbrough & Redcar Railway to a jetty at Cargo Fleet, from where a ferry would carry the ore across the Tees to the blast furnaces. When the proposal was before Parliament the S suggested that their Middlesbrough & Redcar could be extended to Saltburn, and the Tees crossed by a swing bridge. The Cleveland Railway received permission for a line from Skinningrove as far as Guisborough, and the S permission for an extension to Saltburn and a branch to a mine at Skelton. This 1858 S Act also authorised the merger of the S with the railways it held <b>on</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{am concerned}} {{with the issue of}} leasing in commercial relationships. Leasing is a legal concept that was taken over from abroad after 1989. A close connection with lease and relatively short legal history are probably the reasons behind the certain degree of heterogeneity of opinions <b>on</b> <b>leasing.</b> And the diverse opinions <b>on</b> <b>leasing</b> were the main reason for my choice of this topic. I was particularly interested in delimitation of leasing in relation to lease and in legal regulation of leasing. At the same time I assumed that despite the difference of opinions the practice of conclusion of leasing agreements will be unified, considering the large volume of leasing agreements concluded in our country each year. The aim of my dissertation was to cover the majority of the main lines of opinion <b>on</b> <b>leasing,</b> make a comparison of leasing and lease and to assess whether it is necessary to apply the statutory regulation of <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> <b>leasing</b> agreements. Another aim of the dissertation was to assess individual components of leasing relationship, i. e. its participants, subject and content (subjective rights and obligations), both on purely theoretical level {{and in terms of the}} specifics of leasing as reflected in concrete business terms and conditions.
