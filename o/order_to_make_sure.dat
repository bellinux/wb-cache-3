5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it stayed dry.|$|E

Busch would still be guaranteed a starting spot, due to NASCAR's Champion's Provisional Rule, which states that the most recent series champion not in the top 35 in the previous season's final owner points automatically qualifies for a race.

25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E

50|$|In 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered {{parts of}} Gaul and also Belgica (Belgium, modern-day Northern France, Luxembourg, part of present-day Netherlands below the Rhine River; and the {{north-western}} portion of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). There were several tribes {{in the country}} who fought against each other frequently. The Eburones were ruled by Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their harvest, which had not been good that year. Understandably the starving Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that camps be built near the Eburones' villages. Each centurion was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the food supplies were delivered to the Roman soldiers. This created resentment among the Eburones.|$|R

25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she {{was in the process of}} running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
25|$|Baphomet {{also serves}} as the main {{antagonist}} in the PC game Tristania 3D, and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France {{was the one who}} had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> this secret will remain unearthed. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.|$|E

Jack takes Teri out of the chair and holds her in his arms as he realizes that she is dead and weepingly tells her that he's sorry (as he remembers when the family was reunited in the Series Premiere). Teri is then given the first silent clock as the season ends—going to 12:00:00.|$|R
500|$|Bell began {{crafting}} his script, {{adding a}} mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons.

Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> everything went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a [...] "long-standing rule" [...] on the show and re-cast Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode [...] "The Walk"—as Henry Weems.

Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew was to make sure everything stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements. The hopes of the production staff was to make the episode one that they could watch multiple times and notice something new with each viewing.|$|E
500|$|After {{the concept}} was put into the {{pipeline}} for production, General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt's lithium-ion battery pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world. Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, Compact Power (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) cell made by its parent company, LG Chemical; and Continental Automotive Systems, which uses lithium iron phosphate based cylindrical cells made by A123Systems. By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008. General Motors testing process was conducted at the laboratory the carmaker had created for the GM EV1 program. The battery packs included monitoring systems designed to keep the batteries cool and operating at optimum capacity despite {{a wide range of}} ambient temperatures. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the battery pack would last ten years and [...] expected for the battery warranty, the Volt team decided to use only half of the 16 [...] capacity to reduce the rate of capacity degradation, limiting the state of charge (SOC) up to 80% of capacity and never depleting the battery below 30%. General Motors also was expecting the battery could withstand 5,000 full discharges without losing more than 10% of its charge capacity. According to GM, , no batteries have been changed due to degradation.|$|E

He denied to Donaldson any children were killed but 3 children as young as 14 were found among the dead including a 75-year-old man and a priest. He admitted that it was he who compiled the lists of those who were going to be executed.

Ford emphasized to the Army that should harm come to a famous Chief's son, the Comanche would take a terrible vengeance on settlers (which is why Ford insisted that Rangers remain part of Carne Muerto's guards, even while in military custody).
