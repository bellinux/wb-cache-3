5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|The Jardin des Mont du Récollets {{provides}} expansive views {{over the}} plains of Flanders and beyond; {{on a clear day}} it is possible to see the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges. It used to be said that from Cassel <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> five kingdoms: France, Belgium, Holland, England and Heaven. The garden also hosts an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and the Monument des Trois Batailles, commemorating the battles of 1071, 1328 and 1677. Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

25|$|The Revolutions of 1848, {{also known}} as the March Revolution, forced Klemens von Metternich, the reactionary Austrian head of state, to step down. This was celebrated wildly in Frankfurt. On 30 March 1848 <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> black, red, and gold flags everywhere, and the populace was admonished not to shoot into the air.|$|E
25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of {{a recently}} dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the {{eye of a}}n ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the inverted image formed on the retina.|$|E
25|$|Within {{this area}} was the Court of the Women, open to all Jews, male and female. Even a ritually unclean Cohen could enter to perform various {{housekeeping}} duties. There was also a place for lepers (considered ritually unclean), {{as well as a}} ritual barbershop for Nazirites. In this, the largest of the temple courts, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> constant dancing, singing and music.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not just}} that he had superb comic timing: <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{absolutely}} why the family trusted their fates to him. No other British actor had come so close to that dependable, reliable quality of the great Hollywood stars – you would trust him through thick and thin. And he was more humorous than, say, Gary Cooper, more down-to-earth than, say, Cary Grant.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Empedocles {{postulated}} that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit {{the fire in the}} eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{all the way to the}} bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that they were poor.|$|E
25|$|Lavigne {{performed}} a small tour to promote The Best Damn Thing. Only {{members of her}} fan club were allowed to attend the shows. She kicked off the small tour in Calgary, Alberta, and played for a crowd of around 200. The Calgary show aired on television on 2 April 2007, on the CBC Network. On this show, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> behind-the-scenes footage and Lavigne performing songs from The Best Damn Thing, {{as well as other}} shows in Los Angeles, Paris and Madrid. She also held autograph signings in New York City and Hollywood after the album was released.|$|E
25|$|In India and in Indian-Zoroastrian {{communities}} overseas, non-Zoroastrians {{are strictly}} prohibited from entering any space from which <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the fire(s). While {{this is not}} a doctrinal requirement (that is, it is not an injunction specified in the Avesta or in the so-called Pahlavi texts), it has nonetheless developed as a tradition. It is, however, mentioned in a 16th-century Rivayat epistle (R. 65). In addition, entry into any part of the facility is sometimes reserved for Zoroastrians only. This then precludes the use of temple hall for public (also secular) functions. Zoroastrians insist, though, that these restrictions are not meant to offend non-Zoroastrians, and point to similar practices in other religions.|$|E

50|$|Janus {{clinical}} trial data repository is a {{clinical trial}} data repository (or data warehouse) standard as sanctioned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was named for the Roman god Janus (mythology), who had two faces, <b>one</b> that <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{in the past and}} <b>one</b> that <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in the future. The analogy is that the Janus data repository would enable the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry to both look retrospectively into past clinical trials, and also relative to one or more current clinical trials (or even future clinical trials thru better enablement of clinical trial design).|$|R

25|$|In 1982 he {{was invited}} to create a work for Documenta 7. He {{delivered}} a large pile of basalt stones. From above <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys's wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation continues his project still and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones too.|$|E
25|$|At the origin, {{after the}} {{separation}} of hot and cold, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form {{the rest of the}} Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through a hole {{the same size as the}} Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining lunar phases. The stars and the planets, located closer, followed the same model.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E

500|$|According to Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius, Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, {{spotted a}} blooper {{in one of}} the last {{screenings}} of Psycho before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her blink. According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's [...] "making of" [...] documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{had to wear}} a wig and a fake goatee for the episode. Thomas {{described}} Jordan's one-word {{response to}} the question [...] "Do we look like we smoke?" [...] as the best quip of the season. Thomas was also laudatory towards Jordan's character's reactions towards Veronica about events he secretly already knew, such as when he hears a voicemail from Hank not recommending him for an internship. He thought that he played the lie realistically but that <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through his façade upon a repeat viewing. Because the Dean O'Dell storyline was six episodes instead of the initially scheduled seven, some plot strands had to be removed from the final episode and story arc.|$|E
500|$|Christy's role as {{a villain}} has been widely praised by {{television}} commentators, though Patterson's performance {{was the subject of}} negative criticism. Spanos placed Christy as number three on its list of 161 of the series' antagonist as rated by scariness. Demain praised Christy as an interesting character following the reveal that she was secretly working for the Triad. Gavin Hetherington, on the other hand, wrote he was indifferent about Christy, and found Billie to be the stronger character of the two. The story arc was criticized by Digital Spys Hugh Armitage, who felt it was weakened by Patterson's [...] "habit of pulling 'evil' faces when no <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her like a pantomime villain". Jon Langmead of PopMatters summarized Patterson's acting as [...] "huff and puff through her on-camera time".|$|E
