40|$|Intermolecular {{pairwise}} interactions (synthons) {{have previously}} {{been used to}} predict physical properties of molecular crystals, such as polymorphism, morphology and mechanical properties. The overall goal {{of this research was}} to correlate the synthon strength and nature found in the crystal structures of the α- and β-forms of 4 -aminobenzoic acid to experimentally observed data, assessing their applicability for predicting crystallisation conditions that would produce crystals of desirable physical properties. The strength and nature of the synthons found in the α-structure were found to significantly vary, while the strength and nature of the synthons in the β-structure were found to be much more similar. These synthons were also found to influence the conformation of the COOH and NH 2 groups in both structures. Water was calculated to favourably bind to the COOH group than ethanol, along with the <b>OH</b> [...] . <b>O</b> <b>H-bonding</b> <b>dimers</b> being calculated to be less stable in aqueous than ethanolic solutions. This suggests that water may hinder the formation of the α form more so than other solvents. The attachment energy morphological prediction of α-pABA was less needle-like than often observed, probably due to the growth rate of the capping faces growing by a rough interfacial growth mechanism along the long axis of the needle dominated by π-π stacking interactions, being underestimated. Nitromethane (NMe) was calculated to interact more strongly with the phenyl ring than other solvents and hence addition of NMe to ethanolic solutions shortens the long axis of the needle. The experimentally measured local surface molecular chemisty was found to vary between measurements of the bulk and surface at the (1 0 - 1) surface, which is predicted to have unsaturated H-bonds at the surface. Complementing this, spatially resolved measurements across the (1 0 1) surface also showed changes in structure of a supposedly periodic surface. This study revealed how predicting the strength and nature of the synthons in the bulk structure and at the surface, along with their interaction with solvent molecules and stability in solution, can influence the morphology and polymorphism of the crystals produced from solution. ...|$|R

It is shown that the stacking interactions of thymine molecules in water arise mainly due {{to the increase in}} the water—water interaction during the transition from monomers to dimer.

30|$|From {{comparison}} of two processes (the base adsorption and hybridization) presented in Figure  5, {{it follows that}} the first one is more stable; after the base adsorption on the tube surface, the base desorption does not occur practically. While the hybridization is characterized by unstability of formed dimers which dissociate lightly and to stabilize this process, additional conditions (e.g., cooperativity or an additional interaction) are necessary. Besides, the formation of stacking structures of <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimers</b> is hindered by the nanotube surface. In the free duplex, the stacking interaction stabilizes the new <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimer</b> strongly and prevents its following decomposition, and this, in its turn, strengthens the double strand. To organize such stacking structures, the plane of <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimer</b> must detach from the nanotube surface. But this step is prevented with strong π-π stacking interaction of bases with the nanotube surface. Besides, the curved nanotube surface distorts the plane of the dimer formed, and this weakens the H-bonded energy of the dimer. Thus, based on the above factors, it can be concluded that hybridization of two complementary oligomers on the nanotube is complicated because of their strong interaction with the nanotube surface. Formed on the curved nanotube surface, the <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimer</b> is of weaker binding energy than the dimer created under usual conditions without surface.|$|R

The dimers are used as model systems to investigate the energetics and cooperative phenomomena in intermolecular three-center hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions relative to two-center H-bond interactions. The trans–trans conformer of diacetamide is chosen as a suitable model for intermolecular three-center H bonding where one H atom is interacting with two acceptor atoms.

For both model systems, {{it is found that}} the calculated interaction energy per H bond is appreciably smaller in the three-center than in the two-center <b>H-bond</b> <b>dimers,</b> suggesting possibly a general characteristic of intermolecular three-center H bonds, namely, a negative cooperativity.

In centrosymmetric <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimers</b> consisting of identical (hetero) aromatic chromophores, the monomer electronic transition dipole moment vectors subtract or add, yielding S 0 → S 1 and S 0 → S 2 transitions that are symmetry-forbidden or -allowed, respectively.

The excitonic coupling (Davydov splitting) can then be measured between the S 0 → S 1 and S 0 → S 2 vibrationless bands. We discuss the mass-specific excitonic spectra of five <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimers</b> that are supersonically cooled to a few K and investigated using two-color resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy.

Adiabatic and vertical ionization energies (IEs) for monomers and dimers as well as thresholds for {{the appearance of the}} protonated species are reported and analyzed. Non-covalent interactions strongly affect the observed IEs. The magnitude {{and the nature of the}} effect is different for different isomers of the dimers. The computations reveal that for TT, the largest changes in vertical IEs (0. 4 eV) occur in asymmetric h-bonded and symmetric pi- stacked isomers, whereas in the lowest-energy symmetric <b>h-bonded</b> <b>dimer</b> the shift in IEs is much smaller (0. 1 eV). The origin of the shift and the character of the ionized states is different in asymmetric h-bonded and symmetric stacked isomers. In the former, the initial hole is localized on one of the fragments, and the shift is due to the electrostatic stabilization of the positive charge of the ionized fragment by the dipole moment of the neutral fragment. In the latter, the hole is delocalized, and the change in IE is proportional to the overlap of the fragments' MOs. The shifts in AA are much smaller due to a less effcient overlap and a smaller dipole moment. The ionization of the <b>h-bonded</b> <b>dimers</b> results in barrierless (or nearly barrierless) proton transfer, whereas the pi-stacked dimers relax to structures with the hole stabilized by the delocalization or electrostatic interactions...|$|R

However, we believe that this time scale (up to 50  ns) is enough to describe at least the qualitative trend of the hybridization on the nanotube surface. This process is hindered with strong interaction of every oligomer with the nanotube surface.

As such, this system presents a novel target for antimicrobial agents. The channel is maintained shut by the tripeptide glutathione (Ɣglutamylcysteinyl glycine, GSH) and is activated by glutathione Sconjugates formed by the reaction of GSH with electrophiles such as Nethylmaleimide and methylglyoxal. It provides protection via modulation of the intracellular pH, thus making the nucleophilic groups on DNA and proteins less reactive towards the toxic compound. X-ray crystal structures of KefC have been obtained in both the open and closed conformations, which has allowed a model for channel regulation at the molecular level to be proposed. This structure has been used to rationally design activators/inhibitors of the channel and explore the SAR of the system. Systematic modification of the GSH core structure has been undertaken in an effort to develop molecules with both increased affinity and selectivity and to identify the core components necessary for binding. A novel GSHbased fluorescent probe has also been developed to allow development of a rapid and robust assay to test potential inhibitors/activators of this system.

One of these is on the long arm of chromosome 2 and is linked with loci encoding aspartate (Asp) kinase 2 and Asp kinase (AK) -homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH) 2. To investigate whether these enzymes {{can contribute to the}} high levels of Asp family amino acids, we measured their specific activity and feedback inhibition properties, as well as activities of several other key enzymes involved in Lys metabolism. We did not find a significant difference in total activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase, HSDH, and Lys ketoglutarate reductase between these inbreds, and the feedback inhibition properties of HSDH and dihyrodipicolinate synthase by Lys and/or Thr were similar. The most significant difference we found between <b>Oh</b> 545 <b>o</b> 2 and <b>Oh</b> 51 Ao 2 is feedback inhibition of AK by Lys but not Thr. AK activity in <b>Oh</b> 545 <b>o</b> 2 is less sensitive to Lys inhibition than that in Oh 51 Ao 2, with a Lys I 50 twice that of Oh 51 Ao 2. AK activity in <b>Oh</b> 545 <b>o</b> 2 endosperm is also higher than in Oh 51 Ao 2 at 15 d after pollination, but not 20 d after pollination. The results indicate that the Lys-sensitive Asp kinase 2, rather than the Thr-sensitive AK-HSDH 2, is the best candidate gene for the quantitative trait locus affecting free amino acid content in <b>Oh</b> 545 <b>o</b> 2...|$|R

40|$|The rate {{of heating}} which occurs in the middle {{atmosphere}} due to four exothermic reactions involving members of the odd-hydrogen family is calculated. The following reactions are considered: <b>O</b> + <b>OH</b> yields <b>O</b> 2 + H; H + O 2 + M yields HO 2 + M; H + <b>O</b> 3 yields <b>OH</b> + <b>O</b> 2; and O + HO 2 yields <b>OH</b> + <b>O</b> 2. It is shown that the heating rates due to these reactions rival the oxygen-related heating rates conventionally considered in middle-atmosphere models. The conversion of chemical potential energy into molecular translational energy (heat) by these odd-hydrogen reactions is {{shown to be a}} significant energy source in the middle atmosphere that has not been previously considered...|$|R

Bile salt aggregates are promising candidates for drug delivery vehicles due to their unique fat-solubilizing ability. However, the toxicity of bile salts increases with improving fat-solubilizing capability and so an optimal combination of efficient solubilization and low toxicity is necessary. To improve hydrophilicity (and decrease toxicity), we substituted hydroxyl groups of several natural bile acid (BA) molecules for oxogroups and studied their intrinsic molecular association behavior. Here we present the comparative Langmuir trough study of the two-dimensional (2 D) association behavior of eight natural BAs and four oxoderivatives (traditionally called keto-derivatives) floated on an aqueous subphase. The series of BAs and derivatives showed systematic changes {{in the shape of}} the compression isotherms. Two types of association could be distinguished: the first transition was assigned to the formation of dimers throughH-bonding and the second to the hydrophobic aggregation of BAdimers. Hydrophobic association of BAmolecules in the films is linked to the ability of forming <b>H-bonded</b> <b>dimers.</b> Both <b>H-bond</b> formation and hydrophobic association weakene...|$|R
