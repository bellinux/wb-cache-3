25|$|On 21 May 2002, Douglas DC-3A XB-JBR of Aero JBR ditched in Lake Casa Blanca, Texas after {{a double}} engine failure while {{performing}} a touch-and-go at Laredo International Airport. It is reported {{that one of}} the engines suffered a propeller <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition.</b> All three crew escaped from the submerged aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or underspeed condition exists. When an <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition</b> occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the {{pitch of the propeller}} angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition,</b> loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

5000|$|On June 9, 1985, {{the main}} {{feedwater}} pumps, used to supply {{water to the}} reactor steam generators, shut down. A control room operator then attempted to start the auxiliary (emergency) feedwater pumps. These pumps both tripped on <b>overspeed</b> <b>conditions</b> because of operator error. This incident was originally classified an [...] "NRC Unusual Event" [...] (the lowest classification the NRC uses) but it was later determined {{that it should have}} been classified a [...] "site area emergency".|$|R

5000|$|A {{few seconds}} into launch, a {{transient}} voltage caused the KORD {{to shut down}} Engine #12. After this happened, the KORD shut off Engine #24 to maintain symmetrical thrust. At T+6 seconds, pogo oscillation in the #2 engine tore several components off their mounts and started a propellant leak. At T+25 seconds, further vibrations ruptured a fuel line and caused RP-1 to spill into the aft section of the booster. When it {{came into contact with}} the leaking gas, a fire started. The fire then burned through wiring in the power supply, causing electrical arcing which was picked up by sensors and interpreted by the KORD as a pressurization problem in the turbopumps. The KORD responded by issuing a general command to shut down the entire first stage at T+68 seconds into launch. This signal was also transmitted up to the second and third stages, [...] "locking" [...] them and preventing a manual ground command from being sent to start their engines. Telemetry also showed that the power generators in the N-1 continued functioning until impact with the ground at T+183 seconds. Investigators discovered the remains of the rocket 32 miles (52 kilometers) from the launch pad. Vasily Mishin had initially blamed the generators for the failure, as he could not think of any other reason why all 30 engines would shut down at once, but this was quickly disproven by telemetry data and the recovery of the generators from the crash site. They had survived in good condition and were shipped back to the Istra plant, where they were refurbished and worked without any problems under bench testing. The investigative team did not speculate as to whether the burning first stage could have continued flying if the KORD system had not shut it down. The KORD was found to have a number of serious design flaws and poorly programmed logic. One unforeseen flaw was that its operating frequency, 1000Hz, happened to perfectly coincide with vibration generated by the propulsion system, and the shutdown of Engine #12 at liftoff was believed to have been caused by pyrotechnic devices opening a valve, which produced a high frequency oscillation that went into adjacent wiring and was assumed by the KORD to be an <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition</b> in the engine's turbopump. The wiring in Engine #12 was believed to be particularly vulnerable to this effect due to its length, however other engines had similar wiring and were unaffected. Also, the system ended up drawing 25V instead of its designed 15V due to the ruptured power lines. The control wiring was relocated and coated with asbestos for fireproofing and the operating frequency changed. [...] The launch escape system was activated and did its job properly, saving the mockup of the spacecraft. All subsequent flights had freon fire extinguishers installed next to every engine. According to Sergei Afanasiev, the logic of the command to shut down the entire cluster of 30 engines in Block A was incorrect in that instance, as the subsequent investigation revealed.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate a potential boost pump <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition</b> which could exist on the Titan/Centaur launch vehicle after main engine shut-off. Preliminary analyses indicated that the acceleration imparted to the unloaded boost pump-turbine assembly, caused by purging residual hydrogen peroxide from the turbine supply lines, {{could result in a}} pump-turbine overspeed. Previous test experience indicated that turbine damage occurs at speeds in excess of 75, 000 rpm. Detailed theoretical analyses, in conjunction with pump tests, were conducted to establish the maximum pump-turbine speed at main engine shut-off. The analyses predicted a maximum speed of 68, 000 rpm. Testing showed the pump-turbine speed to be 66, 700 rpm in the <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition.</b> Inasmuch as both the analysis and tests showed the overspeed to be sufficiently less than the speed at which damage could occur, it was concluded that no corrective action would be required for the launch vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the main design features of the Magdalen Islands {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT) is described. The turbine has a rotor height of 120 ft (36. 58 m) and diameter 80 ft (24. 38 m). It was operated as a joint project between NRC and Hydro-Quebec in grid-coupled mode from July 1977 to July 1978 when the rotor was destroyed in an accident. The accident, although unfortunate, tested the basic integrity of the design in a gross <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition,</b> and the rotor is being rebuilt with minor modifications. Some directions for future VAWT research are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Euler {{solutions}} for steady transonic flow (Free-stream Mach 0. 63 - 0. 8, alpha = 0 - 2 deg) over NACA 0012 and supercritical airfoils with solid {{as well as}} porous surfaces suggest porosity {{as a means to}} realize multipoint design for transonic airfoils. The porous surfaces extend over at least 90 percent of the chord. The porosity distribution is described by a modified sine wave with several amplitudes. Either connected or separated cavities are assumed to lie underneath the upper and lower surfaces. Applied to an NACA 0012 airfoil, porosity generally increases lift, in some instances by up to 65 percent. Porous NACA 0012 airfoils in supercritical flow yield reductions of an order of magnitude in wave drag at constant lift, compared to their solid counterpart. Making the surface of a supercritical airfoil permeable also leads to sizeable reductions in wave drag at constant lift for <b>overspeed</b> <b>conditions.</b> The discussion of the computed results addresses issues such as grid sensitivity and checks for systematic errors...|$|R
50|$|<b>Overspeed</b> is a <b>condition</b> {{in which}} an engine is allowed or forced to turn beyond its design limit. The {{consequences}} of running an engine too fast vary by engine type and model and depend upon several factors, chief amongst them {{the duration of the}} overspeed and by the speed attained. With some engines even a momentary overspeed can result in greatly reduced engine life or even catastrophic failure. The speed of an engine is ordinarily measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).|$|R
40|$|Globally road {{accident}} {{is considered to}} be an important issue, which can be reduced by proper vehicle speed monitoring system. More recently, the advancement in wireless sensor technology shows a great promise in designing Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness for deployment. The aim of this research is to develop a prototype vehicle speed monitoring system using accelerometer-based wireless sensor. The basic concept of the system is based on the following methodology: developing an experimental system to generate random speed data, which can represent vehicle speed on the road and developing a software to monitor and manage the speed data wirelessly. A wireless sensor attached with a mechanical wheel measures the acceleration vibration of the system, which is equivalent to wheel speed and transmits the data wirelessly to a computer. A software (SpeedManage) has been developed using Java Socket programming codes which converts the vibration data to equivalent speed data and presents these in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If the detected speed is greater than a set speed limit, the data will be automatically saved in a central database {{in the form of an}} electronic report for taking any further action. The functionality of the system has been simulated in a laboratory environment by setting different speed limits for monitoring single or multiple vehicle speed scenarios through appropriate algorithm and code development. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the software continuously presents the vehicle speeds with time and the <b>overspeeding</b> <b>conditions</b> are indicated. The speed details are also continuously updated on the left hand side of the GUI. The system is also capable of generating an automatic electronic report for a simulated speeding vehicle with vehicle number, speed details, time etc. Therefore, based on the performance of prototype system, it can be concluded that sensor-based vehicle speed monitoring system has great potential for monitoring vehicle speed wirelessly. SpeedManage software should help to effectively, automatically and intelligently monitor vehicle speed...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{analysis results}} are presented from the following structures/components analyzed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) between 1982 and 1989 : space shuttle main engine (SSME), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), external tank attach ring, B- 1 stand LOX inner tank, and solid rocket booster (SRB). Results from the SSME high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) second stage blade parametric analysis determine a critical flaw size {{for a wide variety}} of stress intensity values. The engine 0212 failure analysis was a time dependent fracture life assessment. Results indicated that the disk ruptured due to an <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition.</b> Results also indicated that very small flaws in the curvic coupling area could propagate and lead to failure under normal operating conditions. It was strongly recommended that a nondestructive evaluation inspection schedule be implemented. The main ring of the HST, scheduled to launch in 1990, was analyzed by safe-life and fail-safe analyses. First safe-life inspection criteria curves for the ring inner and outer skins and the fore and aft channels were derived. Afterwards the skins and channels were determined to be fail-safe by analysis. A conservative safe-life analysis was done on the 270 redesign external tank attach ring. Results from the analysis were used to determine the nondestructive evaluation technique required...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant overspeed protection instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for overspeed protection. The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition</b> above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4. Assessment of the risk to essential plant systems and struc-tures from potential turbine missiles is reviewed under SRP Section 3. 5. 1. 3. 1. The PSB reviews the turbine generator system and the components and subsystems normally provided with this equipment with respect to the following considera-tions: a. The general arrangement of the turbine and associated equipment with respect to safety-related structures and systems and balance of plant. b. The types and locations of main steam stop and control valves, reheat stop and intercept valves, and associated piping arrangements...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a set of}} studies carried out in parallel with a tidal turbine design program which was undertaken by the Turbomachinery Group to which the author belonged to during the duration of this project. Therefore the work presented in this thesis constitutes {{an exploration of the}} physics of horizontal axis tidal turbines and of the modelling issues associated with the simulation of these devices. Specifically the investigation centered on the behaviour of the turbine when exposed to the influence of tidal channel waves. The numerical analysis of the free standing, gravity stabilised horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) was carried out with the application of Speziale’s Reynolds Stress Model (hereafter know as Speziale, Sarkar and Gatski or SSG model) available in the CFX CFD code. The use of a number of turbulence models was investigated but poor convergence or starting difficulties led to the employment of the SSG Reynolds Stress turbulence model. Simulations for a range of test cases were undertaken ranging from single blade passage cases to transient simulations which included the motion of the turbine and the variation of the flow velocity due to the combined action of waves and the shearing effects of the sea bed boundary layer. A number of CFD results were compared to experimental data acquired from tests conducted on a scale model in the summer of 2009 at the IFREMER test flume in France. An additional source of comparison is provided by data obtained from a BEMT code produced by the CU consultant, Mr Chris Freeman, (Freeman et al., 2009 a). A number of numerical models were assembled to analyse the effects of the presence of the pylon and blade-pylon spacing. These were run as steady and unsteady cases. For the steady cases several angular positions were examined to investigate the effects of the transit of the blades through the pylon potential field and across the sea bed boundary layer shear flow. An idealised no-pylon case was analysed to compare with the equivalent model with pylon. On average there was a performance increase of 2 % for this configuration when compared to the case with pylon for the datum spacing. The simulations covered four turbine rotational speed cases. These correspond to a startup condition and to rated power, with an intermediate point, and to an overspeed regime. In the <b>overspeed</b> <b>condition</b> the power is essentially unchanged but the thrust reduction is strong. Additional investigations covered the performance of the turbine when yawed and the influence of inflow turbulence. The comparisons between the solutions obtained from steady-state and transient simulations showed that the unsteady approach is preferable to describe these types of flow. Two waves were employed in conjunction with the transient models. The first corresponded to a moderate sea state (1 : 5 m height and 10 : 0 s time period) of the type occurring more frequently. The second case involved a substantial wave (3 : 0 m height and 14 : 0 s time period) which is associated with storm conditions. The datum models which incorporated the most energetic wave showed similar values for the torque observed on the transient simulations without waves for the overspeed and rated power cases respectively. This is a significant finding given that the 15 m diameter turbine is immersed in a 35 m tidal channel. The peak value for the axial thrust and torque on the large wave simulation is on average 86 % and 90 % higher than the steady state thrust and torque respectively for the rated power case. The loads imposed on the rotor system for the large wave are approximately 3 % higher than those of the regular wave. Similar detailed studies for tidal turbines are non-existent at time of publication. The work is therefore unique in the scope and breath of the simulations it contains. The computational resources required were vast. Transient simulations including wave effects took three weeks of computation time utilizing sixteen processors. Each of these cases required about several terabytes of storage space to record the intermediate transient results...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally, {{the phenomenon}} of ingress through gas turbine rim seals. The work presented focuses on modelling and measuring the required sealing flow levels to purge the wheelspace against combined ingress {{and the effect of}} externally-induced ingress on the surface temperature and heat transfer to the rotor. Combined ingress is driven by a pressure difference between the mainstream annulus and wheelspace cavity resulting from the combination of the asymmetric external pressure profile in the annulus and the rotation of fluid in the rotor-stator wheelspace cavity. Ingress can be prevented by pressurising the wheelspace through the supply of sealant flow. The Owen (2011 b) combined ingress orifice model was solved to predict the required levels of sealant flow to prevent ingress into the wheelspace. The model was validated using prepublished data and data collected experimentally over the course of this research. Gas concentration measurements were made on the stator of the Bath single-stage gas turbine test rig to determine the variation of sealing effectiveness with sealant flow rate for an axial clearance seal geometry at design and off-design operational conditions. The measured variation of the required sealant flow rate with the ratio of the external and rotational Reynolds numbers, ReW / Reϕ, was consistent with the findings of other workers: at low values of ReW / Reϕ, ingress levels were influenced by the combined effects of the disc rotation and the annulus pressure profile and were therefore considered to fall into the combined ingress region; the influence of rotation diminished as ReW / Reϕ increased and the ingress levels were dominated by the annulus pressure field (externally-induced ingress). The orifice model was in good agreement with the experimental measurements and the prepublished experimental data. Thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) was used to determine effect of ingress on the heat transfer coefficient, h, and adiabatic wall temperature, Tad, on the rotor of the Bath gas turbine rig. Concurrent gas concentration measurements were made on the stator to compare the effects of ingress on the two discs. Data was collected at the design condition, where ReW / Reϕ = 0. 538 and at an <b>overspeed</b> off-design <b>condition,</b> where ReW / Reϕ = 0. 326. The comparison between a newly defined adiabatic effectiveness, εad, on the rotor and the concentration effectiveness, εc, on the stator, showed that the rotor was protected against the effects of ingress relative to the stator. The sealing air, which is drawn into the rotor boundary layer from the source region, thermally buffers the rotor against the ingested fluid in the core. A thermal buffer ratio, η, was defined as the ratio of the minimum sealant flow required to purge the stator against ingress to the minimum sealant flow required to purge the rotor against ingress. The thermal buffer is dependent upon the flow structure in the wheelspace, which itself is governed the turbulent flow parameter, λT. A hypothesis relating η to λT was developed and shown to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The local Nusselt numbers, Nur, on the rotor were shown to be fairly constant with radius and increased as λT was increased. The latter finding {{can be explained by the}} flow structure in the wheelspace: as λT is raised, the swirl in the fluid core reduces, which results in an increase in the moment coefficient and Nur on the rotor. Difficulties in measuring Tad during the experiments suggested a new technique from which to solve for h and Tad using TLC surface temperature measurements. The solution Fourier’s equation for a step-change in the temperature of a fluid flowing over a solid of semi-infinite thickness (the ‘semi-infinite solution’) is limited to relatively low Fourier numbers if Tad is to be calculated accurately. A two-layer composite substrate made from, for example, polycarbonate and Rohacell, could be used to achieve accurate estimates of h and Tad over a larger range of Biot numbers than for a single material substrate. TLC could be used to measure the surface temperature history of the composite substrate during an experiment; this would allow h and Tad to be solved from the numerical solution of Fourier’s equation or from a combination of the semi-infinite and steady-state solutions. The work presented in this thesis has uncovered some interesting findings in areas where research was limited. The measurements of the minimum sealant flow required to purge the wheelspace at off-design operation for a rotor-stator system with blades and vanes and the measurements of the adiabatic effectiveness on a rotating disc affected by ingress are unique and provide a platform for further experimental studies and validation of CFD models.
