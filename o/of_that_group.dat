5|$|External parasites of {{the garden}} warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group</b> are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson has {{the highest}} atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The {{radioactive}} oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although oganesson {{is a member of}} group18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group</b> (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of the 7th period.|$|E
5|$|The only blood parasites {{found in}} a study of blackcaps trapped on {{migration}} were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of H. parabelopolskyi are found only in the blackcap, and form a monophyletic group; three further members <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group</b> are found only in the garden warbler, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan Isospora ashmoonensis was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.|$|E

5|$|The squad {{turned in}} a decent ride in the stage 2 team time trial, {{finishing}} ninth of 22 teams. The result installed Vinokourov into 27th place, 32 seconds off the race lead. Vinokourov took third in stage 4 on the Mûr-de-Bretagne, one of only ten riders to finish together {{at the front of}} the race. He moved up six places to 18th with this result. In stage 8 on Super Besse, Vinokourov and 's Juan Antonio Flecha put in an attack that constituted a clear bid to take the yellow jersey. Starting the day 32 seconds back of race leader Thor Hushovd, Vinokourov surged past Flecha and all remaining members of the morning breakaway other than eventual stage winner Rui Costa. He occupied second position on the road, holding a sufficient time gap that he could take the race leadership, until he was reabsorbed by the depleted front peloton and finished at the back <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group.</b> The result did, however, move Vinokourov up to 11th.|$|E
5|$|Then 20-year-old University of California, Los Angeles long jumper Rhonda Watkins competed on Trinidad and Tobago's behalf as {{the only}} Trinidadian long jumper in Beijing. Watkins had not {{previously}} competed in any Olympic event. During the qualification round, which took place on August 18, Watkins participated in the first heat. She completed a jump of 5.88meters, placing 18th out of a heat that included 21 athletes; <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group,</b> 19 ranked. She ranked ahead of Belize's Tricia Flores (5.25meters) and behind the Republic of the Congo's Pamela Mouele-Mboussi (6.06meters). The heat leaders were Brazil's Maurren Higa Maggi (6.79meters) and Sweden's Carolina Klüft (6.70meters). Overall, Watkins ranked 37th out of the 38 ranking athletes (and 42 involved athletes). She did not advance to the final round.|$|E

40|$|Addressing the question,"What is {{the work}} status of the world's working-age {{population}} and subgroups thereof?"The author gathers data for many countries and infers data where it is missing (which requires making"heroic assumptions"). The results are of course {{only as good as}} the data are representative and accurate. Data are least reliable for sub-Saharan Africa. The high-income group is dominated (in population) by the United States, Germany, and Japan, which account for 58 percent <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group's</b> working-age population. The middle-income group is dominated by Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Brazil, which account for 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group's</b> working-age population. The low-income group is dominated by China and India, which account for 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>group's</b> working-age population.
