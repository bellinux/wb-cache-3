40|$|This study {{examined}} the current practice <b>of</b> a formal <b>mentoring</b> programme at the Hong Kong Baptist University with special emphasis on (a) the mentor and mentees' perspectives on mentoring, (b) the desirable characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mentors,</b> (c) preferences <b>of</b> gender in <b>mentoring</b> and (d) problems in <b>mentoring.</b> Surveys <b>of</b> <b>mentors</b> and mentees were undertaken to provide the basic sources of data. 447 and 79 valid responses were received from mentees and <b>mentors</b> respectively. Ten <b>of</b> the <b>mentors</b> were also interviewed. From the quantitative data collected through the survey, the findings revealed that a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>mentors</b> were male {{so there was a}} high incidence of male mentor-female mentee relationships. Apparent discrepancies between mentors and mentees' views were observed in the desirable characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mentors.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> quantitative data yielded a slight significance between gender expectations on the desirable characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mentors,</b> yet the differences among faculties were significant. There was no gender preference in choosing mentors or mentees but, when given an option, faculty and students would choose a <b>mentor</b> or mentee <b>of</b> the same sex. From the qualitative analysis of mentors' interviews, the problems such as lack of time for both mentors and mentees, the lack <b>of</b> training for <b>mentors</b> and the lack of support from senior management for mentoring were identified. Recommendations include suggestions on how to improve the current <b>mentoring</b> programme, development <b>of</b> a model for mentoring and the need for further research in matching mentors and mentees...|$|R

500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms <b>of</b> <b>mentoring</b> the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E

2500|$|Middleton {{was invited}} to join the faculty at the University of Wisconsin (UW; in Madison, WI) - then a 2-year medical school - {{immediately}} after his internship. He moved to Madison in 1912 as a Clinical Instructor in Medicine, principally serving students at the fledgling UW student health center, along with its director, Dr. Joseph Spragg Evans. Middleton had broad interests regarding areas of clinical investigation, but they especially centered on sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, hematological disorders, infectious diseases and medical history. He steadily rose through the academic ranks, and when the medical school became a four-year degree-granting entity in 1924 and built a university hospital, Middleton emerged as a central figure in the education of third- and fourth-year clinical clerks as well as house officers in internal medicine. He was known for his mastery of the physical examination [...] and for his consummate professionalism. Middleton sign {{is still one of the}} best methods for identifying splenomegaly. A novel and innovative program of [...] "preceptorships" [...] was initiated in 1926, wherein senior medical students were assigned to work with community practitioners throughout Wisconsin as a prelude to internship. That system <b>of</b> <b>mentoring</b> continues to this day. After the death of UW medical school Dean Charles Russell Bardeen in 1935, Middleton was named as his successor. The deanship was a difficult position at that time, because of growing factionalism among academic departments and their faculty members. In spite of that problem, the school flourished under Dean Middleton's guidance over 20 years. He continued to teach actively and to pursue his own research interests despite the administrative demands on his time, ultimately producing more than 300 contributions to the peer-reviewed medical literature. In 1939, the American Board of Internal Medicine was constituted under the aegis of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Middleton was asked to serve as one of the eight initial Board members, and was named Secretary-Treasurer of the organization. He was instrumental in formulating a national curriculum for residency training in internal medicine and a structured system of examination to achieve board-certification in that medical specialty.|$|E
