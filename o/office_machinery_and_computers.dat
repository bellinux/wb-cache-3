30|$|Sectors were {{classified}} {{according to the}} highest aggregate impact on production and {{with respect to the}} widest diffusion of resources. This classification was then compared to the ranking of the most central sectors in the economy. The top ten sectors with the highest impact on aggregate production in the EU are, in order of magnitude, uranium and thorium ores, motor vehicles, basic metals, <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers,</b> other transport equipment, recovered secondary raw materials, leather and leather products, food products and beverages, radio television and communication equipment, and coke refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computer</b> capital (OCM) on the demand for heterogeneous labor. A system of static and dynamic factor demand equations based on {{a variant of the}} generalized Box-Cox cost function nesting the translog, the generalized Leontief and the normalized quadratic functional form is derived and estimated. OCM capital and general capital are treated as quasi-fixed factors. Using panel data on 35 German industries, we find that OCM capital is complementary to all skill levels. For the manufacturing sector, the increase in OCM capital and general capital has accounted for at least 60 percent and 9 percent of the expanding employment of university graduates. In nonmanufacturing industries, we find that an increase in general capital tends to reduce unskilled workers. Wage effects and substitution effects between different types of labor and material inputs play a minor role in explaining employment changes of highly skilled workers and medium-skilled workers but these effects are more important in explaining the demand for unskilled workers.

The present export/import price relations in the two-way-trade are not favourable. The findings suggest aÂ residual specialization of the Czech exports on down market products. But terms of trade development observed over the recent period (1994 - 2000) is positive: Whereas average export prices have risen rapidly, the increase of import prices has been much lower. The best results have been achieved in trade with products of motor car industry, mechanical engineering, electrical machinery, <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers.</b> On {{the other side of the}} scale are products of metalurgy and chemical industry.

30|$|Results {{showed that}} the sectors with the highest shares on GDP are not the top most {{important}} sectors in the EU. However, the sectors with the highest shares have above average centralities. This indicates that the most central sectors may also have a large share in the economy. This was already accounted for when we analyzed sector size. Therefore, highly central sectors are not only successful sectors in terms of production, {{but they are also}} too big to fail because a sector crisis may be diffused to other sectors and have a large impact on global GDP. Finally, we observed that the most common sectors with the highest relative shares in European countries do not correspond to the most common most central sectors with the exception of machinery and equipment and basic metals. Moreover, some of the sectors with the highest relative shares are reported as sectors that bring about a high aggregate effect on the EU economy such as <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers,</b> and radio television and communication equipment.|$|E
40|$|Whether and how {{innovation}} {{activity is}} dependent upon economic factors has been discussed extensively. Most empirical studies on the subject have either used patent data {{as a proxy for}} innovation, or been conducted at an aggregate level. Using a new database on Swedish product innovations (Swinno) this paper examines in what way patterns of innovation activity varied across and within manufacturing sectors during the period 1970 - 2007. Exploring data on the commercialization and technological characteristics of product innovations as well as data on innovating firms the historical development is put into perspective. Sweden, like many other industrialized nations, saw from the structural crisis of the 1970 s the relative decline of shipbuilding, textile, printing industries among others, and the rise of new sectors. The main, tentative, results suggest a Mensch-type clustering of innovations during the Swedish structural crisis of the late 1970 s concentrated to the machinery sector and <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers.</b> Meanwhile, no such pattern could be observed the crisis of the 1990 s.

30|$|This gives {{evidence}} of a relation between three rankings: the most central sectors in each European country, the most central sectors in the EU regional economy, and the most intra-EU traded goods and services. In addition to finding a relation between the most important sectors and the most intra-EU traded ones, we also explored {{if there is a}} relation between our results and the sectors with the highest share in GDP in each economy and the sectors with the highest relative shares with respect to the EU. Relative shares show the share of a sector in one country with respect to the share of that sector in the entire EU, so countries with sectors that have high relative shares show an advantage in the production of the goods of that sector. 13 Own calculations of sector shares in the EU with 2005 Eurostat data showed that the sectors with the highest shares were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, other business services, food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration and defense, and motor vehicles. The most common sectors with the highest shares in European countries were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, other business services, food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration, motor vehicles, and machinery and equipment. Our results are in line with European Comission (a), which shows that the sectors with the highest shares in EU GDP are other business services, health and social work, construction, public administration, financial intermediation, wholesale trade, real-estate, education, retail trade, and other services. Secondly, the sectors with the highest relative shares in most countries are crude oil and natural gas, radio television and communication equipment, <b>office</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers,</b> wearing apparel and furs, forestry and logging, electrical machinery and apparatus, metal ores, and basic metals.|$|E

40|$|Although much ICT-related {{innovation}} activities {{take place in}} non-ICT industries, it has hitherto been difficult to measure the extent of such activities in a quantitative and comparative way.

50|$|Because {{both ends}} of the RS-232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts, {{problems}} will occur when connecting <b>machinery</b> <b>and</b> <b>computers</b> where the voltage between the ground pin on one end, and the ground pin on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections {{at either end of the}} cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as RS-422, RS-485, and USB can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.|$|R
