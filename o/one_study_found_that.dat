5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro's womanhood was {{consistently}} discussed during the campaign; <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{a quarter of}} newspaper articles written about her contained gendered language. Throughout, Ferraro kept campaigning, taking on the traditional running mate role of attacking the opposition vigorously. By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined.|$|E

5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas.

5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when banded sea kraits on Fijian islands were relocated to different islands 5.3km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days.|$|E

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact}} that the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is among the}} most important; <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (marsh hawks, Circus cyaneus; and barred owls, Strix varia), snakes (cottonmouth moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; red foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis). Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites of the marsh rice rat).|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{people with}} or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} changes {{associated with}} infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but infection is sometimes overlooked {{as a possible}} cause. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> infection {{was the cause of}} pain in four percent of nearly 300 people with cancer who were referred for pain relief. Another report described seven people with cancer, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all of them within three days.|$|E

5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|In South America, C.dirus {{specimens}} {{dated to}} the Late Pleistocene were found {{along the north}} and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an area that was inhabited by Canisgezi and Canis nehringi. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> C.dirus was the most evolutionarily derived Canis species in the New World, and compared to C.nehringi was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. For this reason, some researchers have proposed that C.dirus may have originated in South America. In 2009 a proposal was made that C.armbrusteri was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves. The following year, a study yielded evidence that led to the conclusion that C.dirus and C.nehringi were the same species and thus that C.dirus had migrated from North America into South America, making it a late participant in the Great American Interchange.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
