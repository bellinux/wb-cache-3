In the study, sociologists Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of American public <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> different groups. 40% of respondents characterized atheists as a group that [...] "does not at all agree with my vision of American society", putting atheists well ahead of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and homosexuals (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed with the statement, [...] "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group," [...] atheists again led minorities, with 48% disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and African-Americans (27%). Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus Atheists and Secular Humanists, commented on the results, [...] "I know atheists aren't studied that much as a sociological group, but I guess atheists are one of the last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to hate." [...] A University of British Columbia study conducted in the United States found that believers distrust atheists as much as they distrust rapists. The study also showed that atheists have lower employment prospects.|$|E
40|$|A b s t r a c t The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the attitudes of teachers towards the inclusion of learners with special needs in education into regular schools in Kenya in relation to no training or training in special needs education. It goes further to establish whether there is a difference in the attitudes of teachers in relation to the specialization and inclusive modes of teacher training in special needs education. The study also looks briefly at teachers attitudes in relation to gender differences, teaching experience, differences in urban and rural settings and in school and class size. This study involved 186 teachers in schools with programmes for children with special needs and in special schools to obtain opinions using a Likert scaled questionnaire. The study also interviewed four head teachers of schools with programmes for learners with special needs and two education officers at the Ministry of Education headquarters. The schools selected were in urban and rural settings. The findings were analyzed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences (SPSS) and generally indicated a high statistical significant difference in attitudes towards inclusion of learners with special needs into regular schools between teachers with no training and those trained in special needs. Teachers trained in special needs education were more positively inclined to inclusive education. The results also indicated a no statistical significant difference in <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> inclusion between teachers trained in the specialization and those trained in the inclusive model although those trained in the specialization mode were less positive. The results indicated that training and practice in special needs education are important factors in the development of positive attitudes towards inclusion. There was little or no statistical significant difference in attitude formation in relation to gender, to location of school (urban and rural), class size and school size. The main barriers to the implementation of inclusive education in Kenya is lack of a clear policy on inclusive education, lack of collaboration and integration between teachers trained in special needs education with regular teachers, lack of integration between special and regular education and the non-domestication of the universal declarations on inclusive education...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} a matter in my thesis was singing in Musical Art through primary school teachers’ point of view. In {{theoretical}} part we introduced how music leaves an impact on different areas of child development. Secondly, we focused on describing factors such as family, peers, teachers and the wider environment, that {{have an important role}} in developing the attitude of primary school teachers towards singing. We described the role of a primary school teacher in teaching children how to sing and we defined singing activity through the process of planning and performing it at Musical Art. Furthermore, we described vocal technique and vocal care. With the use of questionnaires in the empirical part that was based on theoretical facts and our own experiences, we aimed to discover teachers’ <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> their: <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> singing, competence for teaching singing and <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> their vocal care. The pattern included 143 primary level teachers that teach Musical Art from first to fifth grade in year 2015 / 2016 from randomized Slovenian primary schools. The music teachers who teach Musical Art on primary level were taken out from the research. The results showed that teachers love to sing and that they feel good and confident while singing. The majority said that family played the key role in developing their positive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> singing. The teachers’ <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> upgrading their knowledge of singing and vocal technique have varied based on different age groups. The primary teachers from the group 20 – 35 years want to upgrade their knowledge of singing and vocal technique. Meanwhile, teachers from the group 51 – 65 years do not want to improve their knowledge because in their opinion they already know enough about singing and vocal technique.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} shed light on a puzzle in Australian public finance. Despite the fact that Australian public opinion is more {{strongly}} in favour of social spending than tax cuts, the last two Australian budgets have seen substantial reductions in top marginal tax rates. One possible reason that the tax cutting debate is so out of step with popular opinion may be that many commentators do not realise how low the income of the median Australian really is. I outline evidence from <b>opinion</b> polls <b>on</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> tax cuts. I then analyse the distribution of the 2005 and 2006 tax cuts across individuals and households and discuss how the income of the typical Australian is sometimes misrepresented in policy debates. I conclude with some suggestions about tax reform that may bring about a greater boost to social welfare than the reductions in top marginal tax rates. United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said he paid his tax bills more readily than any other bills, knowing they were the price of “civilised society”. British politician Edmund Burke took the contrary view: “To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men. ” Announcing major personal income tax cuts in 2005 and 2006, Treasurer Peter Costello was clearly happier to throw his lot in with Burke than Holmes. In May 2005, the government announced personal income tax cuts amounting to $ 22 billion over four years. During 2005 – 06, conservative commentators lobbied for further cuts in tax rates, particularly at the top. In the May 2006 budget, Costello cut taxes by a further $ 37 billion over the next four years. This paper seeks {{to shed light}} on a puzzle in Australian public finance: despite the fact that popular opinion in 2004 did not favour tax cuts, the government nonetheless implemented highly-regressive tax cuts in both 2005 and 2006. I suggest {{that one of the reasons}} for this could be that public debates often misrepresent the income of the typical Australian. Contrary to figures that are often reported, median income (the income of the typical Australian adult) is merely $ 27, 000 per year...|$|R
40|$|Analysing {{the survey}} {{carried out in}} Algeria <b>on</b> the <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> {{contraceptive}} practice and fertility and on the knowledge of and practice in preventing pregnancy the author discusses the problem of inadequacy of „western research techniques” – interview with questionnaire and fill-in questionnaire – for the examination of people’s opinions and attitudes in traditionalist communities and cultures. A mechanical transference of techniques and procedures worked out for the modern Euro-american societies and their application to traditionalist communities in the underdeveloped countries causes various disturbances in the research process. Contrary to the ethnocentric assumptions of some western scholars {{it is not so}} common for all people to have developed <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the majority of current problems. In the traditionalist communities of the Third World countries there are often cases when there are no opinions at all and attitudes are not well defined. During an interview-situation both culturally and socially “unnatural” – in a majority of those communities cultural stereotypes appear: the opinions are conventional and trivial. The contact with the interviewer goes beyond the usual experiences of the whole communities and social groups. The relation interviewer – respondent is neither well established nor is it uniform in the people’s culture and social consciousness. The expansion of sociological research in underdeveloped countries is followed by a sharply increasing need of the “acculturation” of techniques and procedures based on interviews. The methodological solutions (controlled interview, Schuman’s Random Probe Technique) proposed at present seem to be unsatisfactory. The application of the most refined and complex techniques and procedures of collecting and analysing data without a general change of the research attitude must be treated as a palliative. According to the author the following methodological directives for the survey <b>on</b> <b>opinions</b> and <b>attitudes</b> in the underdeveloped countries should be adopted: 1. the interviews should be adapted to situations socially “natural”; 2. new interviewing techniques less standardized should be worked out and treated as a supplement to the techniques widely applied to the surveys <b>on</b> <b>opinions</b> (interview without questionnaire, interview with a tape recorder, group discussions); 3. monographic studies on deviant cases should be carried out; 4. projective techniques (e. g. Stycos picture tests) should be widely used. Following Gostkowski the author emphasizes the importance of the society's familiarity with the relation interviewer – respondent which facilitates the institutionalization and standardization of research conditions. The cultural and methodological encapsulation can also be avoided when the achievements of cultural anthropology, ethnography and psychology – expanding and deepening the approach to the phenomenon under study – are taken into account. The most important principle to be followed in the research into the opinions and attitudes {{of the people in the}} Third World countries is a full and thorough knowledge of the social, cultural and economic differences and peculiarities of the communities in question...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{variations in}} social acceptability of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) prior to implementation. The {{influence of a}} number of factors, including socio-economic characteristics, perception of coral resources state of health and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> non-compliance with regulations are analysed. During May 2006, 640 questionnaires were distributed to school children around Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean, for completion by their parents, following an informal educational activity made in school. From a 73 % (n = 469) response rate, results showed that 78 % of participants were in favour of the MPA. Analysis further identified that those supportive of the MPA were generally from higher socio-professional categories, had a negative perception of the coral reef ecosystem's health and were not originally from Reunion. In contrast, locals (born in Reunion) from lower socio-professional categories or with no employment activity and having a positive perception of the health status of coral reefs offered no <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the MPA. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> enforcement and compliance highlighted that SCUBA divers, fishers and jet skiers attributed a higher value to the protection of the coral reef environment through enforcement of MPA regulations than to their own use of the coral reef resource. When asked about the use of penalties to deter non-compliance, swimmers were awarded the lowest fines, followed by SCUBA divers, fishers then jet skiers being awarded the highest fines. Thus, the more severe the act of non-compliance by a resource user group was perceived to be, the more these users themselves disapproved of non-compliant behaviour and supported use of high penalties. The survey design through focusing on school children's parents, demonstrated a simple and cost-effective method for data collection while providing environmental education, which could be employed in similar case studies elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|The National {{strategy}} to improve literacy and numeracy among {{children and young}} people 2011 - 2020 in Ireland states that we need to prioritise literacy and numeracy through positive interventions and integrating these skills across the curriculum. Irish Primary Schools are currently introducing best practice methodologies in literacy and numeracy teaching and Continuous Professional Development (CPD) courses are being rolled out all over the country. However there have been no specific models and CPD courses designed and implemented guiding teachers on how literacy and numeracy skills can be effectively developed in the Primary Science Classroom. The practice and development of key scientific process skills contribute significantly to developing the child’s oral language, reading and writing skills. There is the fear that other curricular areas could be left behind with such a strong focus on developing skills only in English and Mathematics lessons. The overall research question was as follows: What are teachers <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the use of science lessons in, fostering the development of literacy skills in the Irish primary science classroom? This research employed an exploratory sequential mixed methods design of data collection, investigating, identifying and examining the literacy strategies and approaches used by teachers during science lessons, the teachers background and experience and provision of continuous professional development in this area by gathering both quantitative and qualitative data using questionnaires (N= 42) and semi-structured interviews (N= 3). It was found that teachers incorporate oral language skills as much as possible in science lessons. However employing higher-order inquiry based oral language skills that encourage argumentation, collaborative discussions, pupil questioning, open ended-questioning, reading and writing strategies did not feature as prominently in science lessons. Difficulties impeding the use of such strategies were identified as follows: class sizes, overloaded curriculum, classroom management issues, teachers’ poor scientific knowledge, lack of familiarity with and confidence with pupil lead activities and argumentation strategies. It is clear from the results that high-quality science CPD and supports are needed focusing firstly on developing the teachers Inquiry Based Learning skills, Science Knowledge, Critical Thinking and Argumentation Skills and secondly on school planning of science and integrated approaches to teaching. Overall the integration of Literacy skills across the curriculum needs to be addressed. Science offers a wonderful opportunity for children to develop literacy skills. If science can be envisioned as a subject matter that welcomes the inclusion of literacy practices, {{it is more likely that}} primary teachers will find ways to integrate science into their curriculum.

40|$|Purpose: With {{regard to}} the fact that people usually try to avoid {{repetitive}} and boring advertisements, creativity as the heart of advertising effectiveness has a significant role in drawing their attention. On this basis, the present study attempts to evaluate the influence of creative advertising strategies by comparing “in-store” and “out-of-store” creative advertisements. Design/methodology/approach: This research has been conducted in Tehran (capital of Iran) and 588 volunteers randomly participated in the survey so as to examine the consumers’ attitude/behaviour towards the advertised brand, advertised product, and purchases intention exposing creative in-store and out-of-store advertisements. In the current study, creative “end-of-aisle display stands” in grocery stores/supermarkets represent in-store advertising media, and creative “TV commercials” represent out-of-store advertising. Furthermore to examine the hypotheses, one-sample t-test and paired sample t-test were used. Findings: The results show that creative out-of-store advertising has influence primarily <b>on</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertised brand, then <b>on</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertised product, and finally on the purchases intention. On the other hand, creative in-store advertising, firstly has influence on the purchase intention, then <b>on</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertised brand, and lastly <b>on</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> the advertised product. The findings provide important insights to the formulation of strategic marketing/advertising and would pave the related innovative ways to capitalize on strategic opportunities.
