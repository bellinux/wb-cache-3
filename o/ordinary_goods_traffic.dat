50|$|<b>Ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was not so}} buoyant {{though it}} built up later. Despatch of smoked fish, and the fast {{conveyance}} of shellfish to London, became an important traffic.|$|E
50|$|General {{commercial}} {{social development}} fed {{a demand for}} <b>ordinary</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> and some coastal towns became important as holiday resorts {{in the last quarter}} of the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The C&DJR {{had found}} its {{original}} destiny by joining with the GD&HR, and tourism developed {{as the public}} started to enjoy the landscape of Loch Lomond. <b>Ordinary</b> passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> too was healthy. The line was now simply a branch line feeding the trunk routes of the North British Railway.|$|R

50|$|Goods {{traffic was}} {{significant}} with a banana packing factory (operated by Geest, and served by trains from Southampton and Avonmouth docks), and Air Ministry and Royal Engineers depots were rail served. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was withdrawn in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emphasis}} now was on passenger and <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> and {{the original}} objective, the shipping facility, was on the back burner; reporting the opening, the Bristol Times said, [...] "It is intended shortly to commence a port, {{which is expected to}} occupy about two years in the erection." ...|$|E
50|$|The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways in 1948. The {{signal box}} {{was given a}} new lever frame in 1960 but the run down of {{services}} soon commenced.

50|$|It was {{determined}} that the volume of <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was insufficient to warrant retention of facilities at Kopuaranga, and with alternatives available at Opaki and Mauriceville, closure to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was recommended. The Department consulted with the local branch of Federated Farmers in April 1966 who were agreeable to the proposal. Kopuaranga was consequently closed to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> in wagon lots from 1 August 1966.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> was {{important}} with a flour mill, and china clay and stone traffic, and a tarmacadam plant. The china clay works near the station closed in 2008/09. Public <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased on 1 June 1964.|$|R

50|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} {{immediately}} buoyant, {{but at first}} wharves at Briton Ferry were not ready to receive coal trains; the company had been relying on these. Moreover, {{there was a problem}} with silting at Swansea, so it was not until April 1852 that coal traffic was started. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> had started in December 1851.|$|E
50|$|The line {{opened for}} goods 1 November 1889, and for {{passengers}} 2 December 1889; it closed to passenger trains on 1 December 1930; <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased {{on the same}} day but some mineral traffic to Glengarnock ironworks continued; the line closed completely beyond Giffen Royal Naval Armament Depot in 1945; the line remains in place but dormant as far as the RNAD, now named Barrmill Munitions Depot.|$|E
50|$|This led to {{discussions between}} the two companies, at which {{it was agreed that}} a proper {{junction}} would be provided at Llancaiach, and that the GWR would provide proper sidings {{on the north side of}} the Extension line for the colliery traffic. For <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> the GWR would use the TVR goods station on the south side of their line. As the TVR would now take all the colliery traffic out via Quaker's Yard, the three level crossings by which the collieries were accessed from the TVR line would be abolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} open to {{passengers}} on 20 August 1856 and to <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on 1 January 1857. The station closed in 1952 but passenger services on the line continued until 4 July 1966 and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> continued until 1981.|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} World War I (1914-1918) {{resulted}} in a huge upsurge in <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> at Carlisle, and the dispersed goods depots of the individual companies resulted in heavy traffic in trip workings between them. Some beneficial co-ordination was achieved by a (<b>goods</b> <b>traffic)</b> Joint Control Committee from 1916.|$|R

50|$|The station saw mainly {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> and <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was fairly}} light, particularly {{as there was}} no resident coal merchant. Nevertheless, from the early 1960s a local manufacturer of three-wheel invalid cars began regularly sending his goods by rail. However, the decision was taken in 1963 to close the engineers' depot and, in 1965, to concentrate <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on Exeter. At the same time, the Broad Clyst station itself was put forward for closure {{as part of the}} package of economies proposed by the Beeching Report. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> ceased in 1965, with passenger traffic ending the following year.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> usually {{consisted}} of two daily turns Up and Down.|$|R

50|$|Much more {{important}} for the small line was <b>goods</b> <b>traffic.</b> After all even before 1914 Alling had a filter cloth and paper factory as well as a sawmill. In addition a 600mm gauge mine railway transported brown coal until 1959 that was delivered to Viehhausen. <b>Goods</b> <b>traffic</b> continued to operate until the end of 1985.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{existence}} of Giffen goods {{outside the realm of}} economic theory is still contested, the pairing of Giffen <b>goods</b> with <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> has gotten less traction in economics textbooks than the pairing normal good/inferior good used to distinguish responses to income changes. The usage of [...] "ordinary good" [...] is still useful since it allows a simple representation of price and income changes. A normal <b>good</b> is always <b>ordinary,</b> while an <b>ordinary</b> <b>good</b> can be normal, inferior or sticky.|$|R
