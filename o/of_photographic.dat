5|$|There is a {{considerable}} photographic record of early Princes Street, largely thanks to the presence in the street of the studios of the Burton Brothers, pioneering New Zealand photographers. Many of their images, {{and those of other}} early Dunedin photographers, were collated and published in a series of books by photographic historian Hardwicke Knight, one of which — a collection <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> works by Daniel Louis Mundy — was entitled Princes Street by gaslight (1977).|$|E
5|$|Tickets for the 2009 final {{were similar}} to ATM cards, with an {{integrated}} chip storing the ticket holder's personal information {{in order to ensure}} that the ticket is being presented by its legitimate owner. As further security, tickets also had to be presented with an adequate form <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> {{societies}} such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was increasing pressure from activists such as H.B.J. Cramer to have photography {{recognized as an}} art form. Indeed, the movement continued {{right up to the}} 1970s. A counter-movement to pictorialism, the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit was slow to reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to use a variety <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document {{all aspects of the}} base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E
5|$|Although Panther Central, the Towers Lobby which connects {{all three}} towers, and the dining {{services}} {{located on the}} ground floor are accessible to everyone, only residents are allowed in the individual towers and must present their student ID card to a 24-hour security guard to gain entrance. Visitors to any of the Towers must be signed in by a resident of the Tower, and must present either their student ID card if they are a student or a valid form <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> identification if they are not. Guests signed in by residents must be signed out and leave the Tower by 2:00 AM. If not, an overnight stay request must be completed, of which a student can only file a certain number each academic semester. No resident is permitted to sign in more than three people at one time.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E

5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of the}} Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country. Rossier took the first commercial photographs of China and Japan, and they are now quite rare. He complained at times of the adverse effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Many popular museums, {{such as the}} San Diego Museum of Art, the San Diego Natural History Museum, the San Diego Museum of Man, the Museum <b>of</b> <b>Photographic</b> Arts, and the San Diego Air & Space Museum {{are located}} in Balboa Park, {{which is also the}} {{location}} of the San Diego Zoo. The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) is located in La Jolla and has a branch located at the Santa Fe Depot downtown. The downtown branch consists of two building on two opposite streets. The Columbia district downtown is home to historic ship exhibits belonging to the San Diego Maritime Museum, headlined by the Star of India, as well as the unrelated San Diego Aircraft Carrier Museum featuring the USS Midway aircraft carrier.|$|E

5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, a review <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were {{collected at the}} Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred {{at or near the}} Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number <b>of</b> <b>photographic</b> stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned {{the construction of a}} model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E

40|$|Can the {{photographic}} image be remediated in other media? Starting from this question, this article argues how 'un-plugged' media art experiments can create extensions <b>of</b> the <b>photographic</b> image by introducing a new setting in time or space. An analysis of flipbooks, {{based on the}} work of Volker Gerling, is given as an example of a vivifying extension in time that nonetheless underscores the nature <b>of</b> the <b>photographic</b> image. Next, an analysis of the life-sized sculptural installations and models of Hans Op de Beeck demonstrates how a spectator, in an encounter with a spatial extension, can participate in the resuscitation <b>of</b> a <b>photographic</b> image...|$|R
