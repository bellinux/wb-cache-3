5|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>coherence</b> <b>tomography</b> (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging {{technique}} using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} the <b>optical</b> <b>coherence</b> tomographic characteristics of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in age related macular degeneration (AMD) and in idiopathic and inflammatory CNV. The {{use of this}} technique {{in the selection of}} patients for surgery is discussed.  METHODS—Ocular <b>coherence</b> <b>tomography</b> (OCT), fluorescein, and indocyanine green angiography were performed in 23  patients affected by AMD complicated by well defined CNV and in 10  patients affected by inflammatory or idiopathic CNV. The neovascular membrane was surgically removed in five age related CNVs, two inflammatory choroidopathies, and two idiopathic CNVs.  RESULTS—In inflammatory and idiopathic CNV, the OCT displayed a neovascularisation on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In three cases the CNV was excised with an improvement of visual acuity equal to or greater than two Snellen lines; in a fourth case, the visual acuity after surgery was unchanged. In the cases of AMD the OCT fell into three different patterns: (A) CNV above the RPE (five cases); (B) focal, irregular thickening of the retinal pigment epithelial band (12  cases); (C) CNV above and below the RPE (six cases). The five pattern A CNV patients underwent the surgical excision of the neovascularisation. In four cases the visual acuity improved by two or more Snellen lines; in the fifth case the visual acuity remained unchanged.  CONCLUSIONS—The authors suggest that the surgical removal of early age related CNV could be performed in those cases where the OCT shows a neovascular membrane on the RPE, as in idiopathic and inflammatory CNVs.    Keywords: age related macular degeneration; choroidal neovascularisation; <b>optical</b> <b>coherence</b> tomography; vitreoretinal surger...|$|R
