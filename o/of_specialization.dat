5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>specialization</b> is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern <b>of</b> <b>specialization.</b> Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of the concentration <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization</b> <b>of</b> parties across policy jurisdictions. Greater concentration <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization</b> leads parties to concentrate their legislative efforts on a smaller set of policy jurisdictions. Through enhancing their concentration <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization</b> in certain policy areas, parties can more clearly signal their policy concerns and interests to voters. This study argues and shows that relatively low electoral volatility and a low number of political parties (institutional traits) boost the concentration <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization.</b> Greater electoral stability increases the incentives for parties to specialize further on certain policy jurisdictions. I also argue and verify that lower legislative fragmentation, producing larger parties, reduces the opportunity costs <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization.</b> As I explain below, understanding the configuration <b>of</b> legislative <b>specialization</b> might help illuminate the evolution of key characteristics of party systems such as its degree of programmaticness and its degree of institutionalization, and to which extent parties are able to construct issue ownership. ...|$|R
