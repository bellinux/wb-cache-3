[...] In fine, the whole by you so much was blamed, [...] To act their parts, the players were ashamed[2]. [...] Ah, how severe your malice was that day! [...] To damn, at once, the poet and his play[3]: [...] But why was your rage just at that time shown, [...] When what the author writ was all his own? [...] Till then, he {{borrowed}} from romance, and did translate[4]; [...] And those plays found a more indulgent fate.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings. For the sauce, originally fresh white tuna (in most restaurants canned tuna is used today to reduce cost and preparation time) is simmered until fully cooked in white wine, cider vinegar, white onion and garlic, and then puréed with a mix of olive and vegetable oil and egg yolks in an electric blender or food processor to form a thick mayonnaise. For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. The thick, smooth purée is then somewhat thinned with a little water and cooking liquid from the veal and a few capers are stirred in. Some of the sauce is spread out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>serving</b> platter and the cold slices of veal are arranged {{in a single layer on}} top. The rest of the sauce is then poured over the veal so that it is, generally, completely covered. The dish is allowed to refrigerate for a period up to 5 days to fully develop the flavor.|$|E
5000|$|Corbyn {{stated that}} [...] "The {{whole of the}} Labour Party and Labour family - and indeed the whole country - will be in shock at the horrific murder of Jo Cox today" [...] and paid tribute to a [...] "wonderful woman". A vigil was held in Parliament Square {{attended}} by senior politicians in the Labour party including Corbyn. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon described the news as [...] "utterly shocking and tragic news, which has left everyone stunned". Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo stated: [...] "This is a truly appalling attack <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>serving</b> MP working hard to serve her community. This horrific act is an attack on democracy and the British freedoms that Jo Cox worked so diligently and passionately to defend." [...] Rosena Allin-Khan, who won the Tooting by-election for Labour, used her victory speech {{to pay tribute to}} Cox: [...] "Jo’s death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile. We must never forget to cherish it." [...] Prime Minister David Cameron and Corbyn made a joint visit to Birstall the day after the attack, where they joined locals to lay floral tributes to Cox. Cameron said:The most profound thing that has happened is that two children have lost their mother, a loving husband has lost a loving wife, and parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners, someone who epitomised the fact that politics is about serving others.|$|E
5000|$|Critic David Edelstein {{described}} No Strings Attached as a {{film with}} [...] "a supposedly feminist veneer...(that) never makes the case for Emma's point of view. It's almost a feminist backlash movie, and it didn't have to be. There are plenty of reasons for brilliant young women, especially with the stress of a medical career, to approach time- and emotion-consuming relationships warily." [...] He expressed disappointment on overuse of stock characters, as well as Reitman's [...] "heavy-handed" [...] direction and {{a story that is}} ultimately [...] "corny and contrived and conservative." [...] A. O. Scott called the film [...] "not entirely terrible...high praise indeed, given that this is a film aspiring to match the achievement of 27 Dresses, When in Rome, and Leap Year"; according to Scott, the film is [...] "Love & Other Drugs without the disease", a film whose pleasures [...] "are {{to be found in the}} brisk, easy humor of some of Ms. Meriwether's dialogue and in the talented people scattered around Ms. Portman and Mr. Kutcher like fresh herbs strewn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>serving</b> of overcooked fish." [...] Scott considered [...] "the film's great squandered opportunity - and also the source of some of its best comic moments - is that Ms. Gerwig and Mindy Kaling in effect share the role of Emma’s zany sidekick. How can this be? Why are these two entirely original and of-the-moment performers marginal players in this agreeable, lackluster picture and not stars of the year’s greatest girl-bromance?... To imagine Ms. Kaling and Ms. Gerwig in a remake of Thelma and Louise or the Wedding Crashers is to experience an equal measure of frustration and hope. Why can’t we have a few movies like that and not quite so many like this?" ...|$|E
