5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|Between 10 and 11million people {{watched the}} {{original}} six-episode broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The episodes were repeated each week on BBC Two. The final episode <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice had a {{market share of}} about 40 percent in Britain, by which time eight foreign countries had bought {{the rights to the}} serial. 3.7million Americans watched the first broadcast on the A Network, which aired the serial in double episodes on three consecutive evenings beginning 14 January 1996.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|Austen's novels {{appeared}} in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice, quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen {{was not well}} known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works {{as part of the}} English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E

5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every {{individual}} was encouraged to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> arrogance.|$|E
5|$|When {{casting the}} many {{characters}} <b>of</b> <b>Pride</b> <b>and</b> Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could also play the Regency period. Their choices for the story's protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E

5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crรจche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{political}} landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain {{economic and social}} advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, some cities established {{a long period of}} dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.|$|E

5|$|The debacle in Russia {{loosened}} the French {{grip on the}} German princes. In 1813, Napoleon {{mounted a}} campaign in the German states {{to bring them back}} into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blรผcher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blรผcher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blรผcher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> <b>and</b> enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key building block of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.|$|E
