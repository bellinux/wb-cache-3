5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce <b>overall</b> <b>weight</b> also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
5|$|This was {{addressed}} in the major production model, the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with 746kW (1,000hp), which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500kg (1,102lb) to 1,000kg (2,200lb). However the combat range with a full 1,000kg (2,200lb) bomb load was a very short 330km (200mi). The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of {{the sides of the}} upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of them could be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its <b>overall</b> <b>weight</b> increased from 17,600lbs to 17,920lbs (7,983 to 8128kg). After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers. The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained. These features were present in the next variant the Z-3.|$|E

25|$|To {{minimize}} <b>overall</b> <b>weight</b> and size, miniature PM motors may use {{high energy}} magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs {{are at least}} competitive with all optimally designed singly-fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.|$|E
25|$|Lead weights can be {{coated with}} a {{protective}} outer layer such as plastic or paint, and this is commonly used for lead abatement. This prevents the lead from corroding or being ground into dust by rubbing, and helps to cushion impacts. However the protection is reduced if the coating is cracked or otherwise damaged. Soft plastics may become brittle over time due to UV degradation {{from the sun and}} loss of plasticizers, leading to cracking and shattering. Encapsulation materials are usually of near neutral buoyancy in water, and reduce the average density of the weights, making the weights slightly less effective, and increasing the <b>overall</b> <b>weight</b> in air of the diving equipment.|$|E
25|$|Motorized {{bicycles}} using {{electric motors}} have also re-entered the market.

While costly, new types of lithium batteries along with electronic controls now offer users increased power and range while reducing <b>overall</b> <b>weight.</b> Newer electric motor bicycle designs are gaining increasing acceptance, particularly in countries where increasing traffic congestion, aging populations, and concern for the environment have stimulated development and usage.|$|E

40|$|With Taiwan ROC’s {{economic}} growth, {{the importance}} of service industries has gradually increased. Tourism services, as a comprehensive undertaking with multiple objectives, contribute greatly to the foreign exchange earnings of the country. Specifically, international hotels, which provide accommodation, catering, shopping, socializing, committee rooms and recreation, {{play a crucial role}} in the tourism industry. The current study adopted the Delphi method and offered an anonymous channel for conveying opinions. After repetitive consultations, summarizations and revisions, the analytic network process (ANP) principles for the study were finally constructed. The subjects of the study were clients of international tourist hotels in the Taipei area. In total, 250 questionnaires were distributed, and 176 valid questionnaires were collected, at a questionnaire response rate of 70 %. As the results demonstrated, the most significant dimension was “Responsiveness” (weight = 0. 238) : which accounted for 23. 8 % of the <b>overall</b> <b>weights.</b> Other dimensions were also important: “Assurance” (weight = 0. 217), “Reliability” (weight = 0. 205), “Empathy” (weight = 0. 183), and “Tangibles” (weight = 0. 157). The research results showed that “Responsiveness” was of the greatest importance for service quality in international tourist hotels. The data compiled from the <b>overall</b> <b>weights</b> of evaluation indicators of the service quality for the international hotels showed that, among the 16 evaluation indicators, the top five indexes were ranked, based on importance, as follows: service willingness, expertise, responsiveness, reliability, and cordiality...|$|R
25|$|Driving an {{avalanche}} is the {{component of the}} avalanche's weight parallel to the slope; as the avalanche progresses any unstable snow in its path will tend to become incorporated, so increasing the <b>overall</b> <b>weight.</b> This force will increase as the steepness of the slope increases, and diminish as the slope flattens. Resisting this {{are a number of}} components that are thought to interact with each other: the friction between the avalanche and the surface beneath; friction between the air and snow within the fluid; fluid-dynamic drag at {{the leading edge of the}} avalanche; shear resistance between the avalanche and the air through which it is passing, and shear resistance between the fragments within the avalanche itself. An avalanche will continue to accelerate until the resistance exceeds the forward force.|$|E
25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the <b>overall</b> <b>weight</b> of the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} cargo {{aircraft}} then coming into service, the C-76 was already obsolescent, even allowing for its war-priority method of construction. In addition, the C-76 failed {{a number of}} critical flight tests. It was discovered in testing that the C-76 was unstable when not carrying a cargo load; {{in order to obtain}} a stable center of gravity, the plane had to be ballasted beyond its maximum permissible gross takeoff weight. At any speed, or in any gusting wind, the C-76's elevators would flap back and forth violently. The wing structure failed in eight separate static tests, sometimes with a load as low as 40% of the wing's rated capacity. The wing failures were attributed by some sources to the failure of the fasteners used to secure the wood components of the aircraft. Numerous additional fasteners, metal stirrups, and wood ply reinforcements were added to the structure in an effort to strengthen it, thereby increasing the plane's <b>overall</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
