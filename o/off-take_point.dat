50|$|The {{project had}} been {{prepared}} keeping in view the need for 400 MCFT of water during late July to August, {{for a period of}} 30 days to the Park which is to be had by diverting and lifting flood waters of Yamuna. The project thus covered diversion of water during monsoon through underground pipes with lifting arrangements over a length of 16 km. from the <b>off-take</b> <b>point</b> of Goverdhan drain near Santruk village. The estimated cost of the project as proposed by the State Government was to the tune of Rs650 millions. The project proposed was to channelize water from Govardhan drain to meet the water deficit of KNP during the months of July to September at the time of requirement. The major components of the project were construction of a head regulator with control gate at the drain located in the state, raw water reservoir with capacity of 13,000 m, 3 pump houses, DG sets for pumping station and laying and testing of /PCC/MS pipelines.|$|E
50|$|The {{density of}} {{structures}} in the system is quite high. The canal network crosses many flashy rivers, hence many cross drain structures (siphons) have {{been built in the}} system. Steel gates have been built at all <b>off-take</b> <b>points</b> from the main canal and at all tertiary off-takes from secondary canals. The total number of such regulating structures is 322. Including all other subsidiary hydraulic structures, the structural density is as high as 0.2 per ha.|$|R
40|$|Cylindrospermopsis is a cyanobacterial {{species of}} global concern, {{due to its}} ability to produce potent toxins and its near {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. To date, both management and research efforts for Cylindrospermopsis have focused on riverine settings. By contrast, off-stream storages are inadequately studied, particularly in terms of population dynamics and toxin proﬁles, how these are linked with the riverine systems that seed them, and what management options are best for optimizing water quality. This is a critical gap, given that storages are key <b>off-take</b> <b>points</b> for many water users, including for livestock watering and industrial supply. This study {{examined the relationship between}} a riverine and an off-stream environment, with respect to the development of toxic Cylindrospermopsis blooms in central Queensland. It discusses the role of an aeration system in preventing or delaying bloom development and explores the implications of intake depth with respect to population (cell density) and toxicity. Along the impounded river, the study sites featured warm, stratiﬁed conditions and an anoxic hypolimnion. By contrast, the off-stream storage dam lacked stratiﬁcation, due to the constant aeration provided by a hypolimnetic bubbler. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii blooms appeared in both environments, with peak cellular concentrations detected in the subsurface waters. The dynamics of the toxin proﬁles differed, however, with the riverine concentrations being mostly epilimnetic, whereas the dam featured toxin distributed throughout the water column. Concentrations of both cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and deoxy-cylindrospermopsin (deoxy-CYN) were lower in the dam, compared with the riverine sites. A one-month lag period was evident before C. raciborskii cells appeared in the dam following their observation in the river samples, and a similar period elapsed before the dam populations reached their peak concentrations. These data are invaluable in considering the best management options for off-stream sites that experience seeding from riverine populations, particularly for toxin producers such as Cylindrospermopsis...|$|R
