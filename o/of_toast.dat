5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type <b>of</b> <b>toast</b> with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E

Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.|$|E

25|$|Maturing {{can also}} be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after {{fermentation}} but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent <b>of</b> <b>toast,</b> butter, and vanilla but it also helps to mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize {{the components of the}} wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.|$|E
25|$|The Carrington service had, as its competitor, a horse {{bus service}} {{operated}} by Messrs Andrews of Carrington. When this firm went bankrupt, in 1888, the Tramway Company bought {{four of their}} horse buses and converted them to tram cars. In 1891 two of the converted buses were scrapped, as was car No.19, which was an 1881 Starbuck single deck design, converted to double deck in 1885. The other two converted horse buses were renumbered, and four further new cars were obtained. From G.F. Milnes & Co., two double-deckers were purchased, and two <b>of</b> <b>toast</b> rack design came from an unknown maker. It is possible that those two toast rack vehicles were built at Nottingham in the company’s own works.|$|E
25|$|Wassail is a hot, mulled punch often {{associated}} with Yuletide drunk from a 'wassailing bowl'. The earliest versions were warmed mead into which roasted crab apples were dropped and burst to create a drink called 'lambswool' drunk on Lammas day, still known in Shakespeare's time. Later, the drink evolved to become a mulled cider made with sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, topped with slices <b>of</b> <b>toast</b> as sops and drunk from a large communal bowl. Modern recipes begin with a base of wine, fruit juice or mulled ale, sometimes with brandy or sherry added. Apples or oranges are often added to the mix, and some recipes also call for beaten eggs to be tempered into the drink. Great bowls turned from wood, pottery or tin often had many handles for shared drinking and highly decorated lids; antique examples can still be found in traditional pubs. Hence the first stanza of the traditional carol the Gloucestershire Wassail {{dating back to the}} Middle Ages.|$|E

500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson {{had been}} around for a while, with several {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story to balance the episode out, and the idea of using the telemarketing scam for this had also {{been around for a}} while. By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from his nose was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece <b>of</b> <b>toast,</b> which had Vaseline on it.|$|E

Conradin rebels against his aunt and her choking authority. He invents a religion in which his pole-cat ferret is imagined as a vengeful deity, and Conradin prays that [...] "Sredni Vashtar" [...] will deliver retribution upon De Ropp. When De Ropp attempts to dispose of the animal, it attacks and kills her.

2500|$|Louis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, {{is said to}} {{have sold}} the first {{hamburger}} and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900. New York magazine states that [...] "The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute. A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices <b>of</b> <b>toast.</b> Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.|$|E
2500|$|Sculpture classes {{taught him}} {{about the power of}} the line in artworks and its {{placement}} in nature. Lowe studied the works of Brâncuși, where he familiarized himself with geometry in sculpture, and Henry Moore's works regarding scale in sculpture. And with the popularity of plastic in the 1960s Lowe expanded his mediums to complete 3-D works including a life-size toaster of sheet plastic made from a sandwich sealer, complete with pieces <b>of</b> <b>toast</b> in the slot, recalling the soft sculpture works of Claes Oldenburg at the time. His first undergraduate installation Laundry Bags (1969), showing a pile of clear plastic trash bags filled with colored rags piled in the corner of an exhibition space.

[...] "Andover was the best time of my life," [...] she recalled. She played the lead role of Nellie Forbush in the school's spring musical production of South Pacific opposite Peter Kapetan as Emile. She commented: [...] "It was just a little awkward to be Nellie at first because she hesitates to marry Emile since he had once lived with a Polynesian woman – I don't agree with her reasoning so that made things a bit hard at the beginning." [...] She appeared in a student video directed by classmate Jonathan Meath in a film class taught by Steve Marx. She graduated in 1974 with the academic honor of [...] "cum laude" [...] which was awarded to 80 out of 378 graduating seniors. She majored in theater at Wesleyan University, worked in summer stock productions during vacations, and graduated in 1978. Later, in an interview, she reported that she sometimes had eating disorders during this time of her life. She said: [...] "I binged... I starved ...

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value <b>of</b> <b>toasted</b> pigeon pea Cajanus cajan {{seed in the}} diet of African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) was investigated in this study by progressively increasing its inclusion level (100, 200, 300 and 400  g kg− 1) in isonitrogenous (35 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (17. 7  kJ g− 1) diets. <b>Toasting</b> <b>of</b> the C. cajan seed significantly reduced the anti-nutrients and increased most essential amino acid, protein, and fibre in the seeds. The growth of C. gariepinus (1. 36  ±  0. 05  g) fingerlings fed in triplicate 1  ×  1  ×  1 m 3 hapa pond system (n =  40 in triplicates) was significantly improved by the different inclusion levels <b>of</b> <b>toasted</b> C. cajan in the diets after 56  days. Comparing {{the performance of the}} fish fed 400  g kg− 1 <b>of</b> <b>toasted</b> C. cajan with that fed raw seed (400  g kg− 1) reveal the efficacy of this processing method in improving the utilization of the feedstuff. Mortality was significantly higher (32 %) in fish fed the diet containing raw inclusion compared to that fed the control diet or inclusion <b>of</b> <b>toasted</b> C. cajan ( <  5 %). Cost analysis revealed that it was economically cheaper to raise the African catfish using toasted C. cajan at 400  g kg− 1. It was therefore concluded that toasting improves the nutritional quality of C. cajan, resulting in better performance at higher inclusion levels, hence, can possibly reduce the cost of catfish production...|$|R
