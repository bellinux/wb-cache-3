The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda.

5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} {{for a number of}} weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month to get off the mark at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turning and hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E
5|$|In June 1966, Irvine had an altercation with Burnley {{chairman}} Bob Lord {{after returning}} late from a Northern Ireland match. Nevertheless, he retained {{his place in}} the starting line-up {{at the start of the}} 1966–67 campaign, and scored in the first match of the season against Sheffield United. After a pre-season tour of Austria, throughout which Burnley remained undefeated, the team were confident of a successful season and especially looked forward to European competition in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On 20 September 1966, Irvine scored the sole Burnley goal in the 1–1 draw against German side VfB Stuttgart. The following month, he scored in consecutive league matches against Leicester City and Manchester City at Turf Moor. Irvine was on the scoresheet again in the next round of the Fairs Cup as Swiss team Lausanne Sports were beaten 5–0 in Burnley on 25 October 1966. By the middle of the season, Irvine had scored 13 goals in the league, four fewer than the same stage of the previous campaign. He scored his first goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> on 31 January 1967 in the FA Cup third round replay against Everton at Goodison Park. However, early in the second half, Irvine was tackled by Everton defender Johnny Morrissey. The challenge—not deemed a foul by the referee—broke his shin bone, and Irvine was immediately substituted and replaced by fellow Irishman Sammy Todd. The injury meant that he did not play again for Burnley for the remainder of the season. He was forced to remain on the sidelines as Burnley finished 14th in the First Division and reached the fourth round of the Fairs Cup before being knocked out by Eintracht Frankfurt.|$|E

In the first home match <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year,</b> on 17 January 1925, Nelson atoned for their defeat to Accrington Stanley earlier in the season with a 4–1 win thanks to two goals from Eddleston, one from Chadwick, and a first goal in almost three months for Cameron. Clem Rigg scored two penalties the following week as the side beat Barrow to move above Bradford Park Avenue into fifth position in the Third Division North. On 7 February Nelson won their third consecutive home fixture, beating Tranmere Rovers by four goals to one. Left-half Herbert Butterworth made his senior debut for the club against Tranmere, despite signing from Wolverhampton Wanderers almost two years previously, while Chadwick scored twice in one game for the first time. A trip to Walsall seven days later brought a first away victory of 1925 for the team as goals from Chadwick and Hoad gave Nelson a 2–1 win, which elevated them to third place in the league. A narrow win against Wigan Borough at Seedhill on 21 February lifted Nelson further up the table into second position, behind only Darlington. The team ended a successful February with a fourth victory of the month, beating Halifax Town 4–2 before a crowd of 10,000 spectators at The Shay.|$|E
