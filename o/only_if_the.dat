5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{transition function}} on the {{blocks of the}} automaton is invertible, {{and in this case}} the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|In other words, it {{is equal}} to the {{absolute}} value of the first derivative of quantity with respect to price (dQd/dP) multiplied by the point's price (P) divided by its quantity (Qd).

5|$|Linear maps V → W {{between two}} vector spaces form a vector space HomF(V, W), also denoted L(V, W). The space of linear maps from V to F {{is called the}} dual vector space, denoted V∗.

5|$|Newton's {{derivation}} of Proposition 43 {{depends on}} his Proposition 2, derived {{earlier in the}} Principia. Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a central force. Newton showed that a force is central if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.|$|E
5|$|The High Courts are the {{principal}} civil courts of original jurisdiction in each state and union territory. However, a High Court exercises its original civil and criminal jurisdiction <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> subordinate courts are not authorized by law to try such matters for lack of pecuniary, territorial jurisdiction. High courts may also enjoy original jurisdiction in certain matters if so designated specifically in a state or federal law.|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of Ahimsa {{as the very}} first restraint {{in the very first}} limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> self is purified in thought, word and deed through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Total {{wind power}} could be {{captured}} <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wind velocity {{is reduced to}} zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E
5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E

Subsequently, a poll was posted on the 2K Games operated Cult of Rapture community website in which visitors could vote on what features they would most like to see in a special edition; the company stated that developers would take this poll into serious consideration. To determine what artwork would be used for the Limited Edition cover, 2K Games ran a contest, with the winning entry provided by Crystal Clear Art's owner and graphic designer Adam Meyer.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E

5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December, Ali messaged the United Nations {{requesting}} a cease-fire, {{but it was}} not authorized by the President Yahya Khan and the fighting continued. Following several discussions and consultations, and subsequent attacks by the Indian forces, Khan decided to stop the war in order to save the lives of Pakistani soldiers. The actual decision to surrender was taken by Niazi on 15 December and was conveyed to Manekshaw through the United States Consul General in Dhaka (then Dacca) via Washington. But Manekshaw replied that he would stop the war <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani troops surrendered to their Indian counterparts by 9:00a.m. on 16 December. Later the deadline was extended to 3:00p.m. of the same day at Niazi's request. The Instrument of Surrender was formally signed on 16 December 1971.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov {{established}} himself astride the Prussian communication line at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed only at a single narrow point on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Russians were not fully deployed.|$|E
