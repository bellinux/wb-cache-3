5|$|In 1999, {{four women}} {{were killed by}} Cary Stayner just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> That same year a large rockslide {{originating}} at {{the east side of}} Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped a little after those incidents, but soon returned to its previous level.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{occupies}} limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. In Thailand, Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{is restricted}} to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and are therefore unprotected.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park is {{the largest}} Royal Park in London. It is bounded on the north by Bayswater Road, to the east by Park Lane, and to the south by Knightsbridge. Further north is Paddington, further east is Mayfair and further south is Belgravia. To the southeast, <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> is Hyde Park Corner, beyond which is Green Park, St. James' Park and Buckingham Palace Gardens. The park has been Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens since 1987.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, I-87 intersects NY9N again at exit34, the southernmost {{junction}} to feature bilingual guide signs in English and French {{due to the}} road's proximity to Quebec. Past NY9N, the Northway curves to the north, running along {{the west side of}} Keeseville before entering another rural but fairly level stretch that follows I-87 out of Adirondack Park. Now <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> the highway encounters more frequent pockets of development as it follows NY22 into the town of Plattsburgh. Just inside the town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY22 at exit36, a junction serving nearby Plattsburgh International Airport. While NY22 heads northeast into the city of Plattsburgh, I-87 runs north through its western suburbs, passing over the Saranac River and intersecting NY3 at exit37. The Northway and NY22 meet again north of downtown at exit38.|$|E
5|$|<b>Outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> boundary, the area's {{industrial}} heritage {{is represented by}} the Mining Museum at Matlock Bath where it is possible to tour the Temple Lead Mine, the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and Brindley Water Mill at Leek. The preserved steam railway, Peak Rail between Matlock and Rowsley, the National Tramway Museum at Crich and the Cromford Canal chart the area's transport history. The Life in a Lens Museum of Photography & Old Times in Matlock Bath presents the history of photography from 1839. Other attractions on the fringes of the region include the theme parks at Alton Towers and Gulliver's Kingdom, and the Peak Wildlife Park.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is in the}} West Branch Pine Creek {{drainage}} basin, {{where the}} underlying rocks are primarily conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. Two major rock formations are present in Cherry Springs State Park, both at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The lower formation is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. <b>Outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> the creek has cut down into the Devonian Catskill Formation, a reddish sandstone.|$|E

25|$|One {{factor in}} the project's final failure was {{that even though the}} Cedar Grove dam site was <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> the project {{required}} two additional dams to be built upstream if it were to be economically feasible. However, those sites were now inside the park boundary as designated in 1940. On August 6, 1965 Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were finally added to the park, making them permanently off-limits to new dams as well. These annexations (with the exception of a tiny section in 1984, south of Grant Grove) brought Kings Canyon National Park to its present size.|$|E
25|$|The Beattie Park Mound Group {{is located}} in {{downtown}} Rockford, Illinois' Beattie Park. It consists of three conical mounds (one <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> boundaries), an effigy mound {{in the shape of}} a turtle, and a linear mound. Beattie Park is north of Park Avenue and south of Mound Avenue, but there is one mound remnant in front of the house at 509 Indian Terrace. On its west, the park is bounded by Main Street and to its east lies the Rock River. Mounds are the most visible evidence of cultures that lived for hundreds of years in the mix of biomes in northern Illinois.|$|E
25|$|The park {{management}} {{is trying to}} protect and conserve the park’s natural and cultural heritage in the most natural state possible. It places emphasis on maintaining a healthy and high yielding rainfall catchment. Upland swamps are also important due to the rare species they contain, and so have been classified as a Priority Fauna Habitat. The park management also helps conserve area <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> perimeter. The {{management is}} also rehabilitating areas disturbed by invasive species {{with a focus on}} sedgeland – Health Complex, heath woodland, ironstone woodland and ironstone heath. Maintenance of rare, threatened and endangered flora and fauna is a priority along with maintaining diversity and regenerating areas, which have been disturbed.|$|E
