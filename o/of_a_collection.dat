5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> {{of letters and}} essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson.

These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E
