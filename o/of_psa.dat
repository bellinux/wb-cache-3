40|$|Detection of {{prostate-specific antigen}} remains the {{mainstay}} {{in the early}} detection of prostate cancer.

While the separate detection <b>of</b> free <b>PSA</b> and the ratio of free to total PSA has significantly improved specificity while maintaining high sensitivity, the number of patients undergoing unnecessary further diagnostics is still of concern. In this context, the evolving knowledge on isoforms <b>of</b> free <b>PSA</b> is a major focus of current research. Isoforms <b>of</b> free <b>PSA</b> are variants <b>of</b> free <b>PSA</b> that circulate, e. g., as precursor forms, internally cleaved variants of intact molecules, and are suggested to be either more associated with cancer or more with benign diseases.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} model the hysteresis and dynamic characteristics of piezoelectric stack actuators (PSAs), {{consider that a}} linear force and a hysteresis force will be generated by piezoelectric wafers under the voltage applied to a PSA, and the total force suffering from creep {{will result in the}} forced vibration of the two-degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper system composed of the equivalent mass, stiffness, and damping of the piezoelectric wafers and the bonding layers. A modified comprehensive model for PSAs is put forward by using a linear function, an asymmetrical Bouc-Wen hysteresis operator, and a creep function to model the linear force, the hysteresis force, and the creep characteristics, respectively. In this way, the effect of the bonding layers on the hysteresis and dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>PSAs</b> can be analyzed via the modified comprehensive model. The experimental results show that the modified comprehensive model for PSAs with the corresponding parameter identification method can accurately portray the hysteresis and dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>PSAs</b> fabricated by different layering/stacking processes.

25|$|The {{physiological}} function of KLK3 is {{the dissolution of}} the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition <b>of</b> <b>PSA.</b> At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E
25|$|PSA is {{produced}} in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using immunohistochemistry. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and {{is the cause of}} elevated blood levels <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> in these conditions.|$|E
25|$|PSA {{was first}} {{identified}} by researchers attempting {{to find a}} substance in seminal fluid that would aid {{in the investigation of}} rape cases.

The semen of adult males has PSA levels far in excess of those found in other tissues; therefore, a high level <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> found in a sample is an indicator that semen may be present. Because PSA is a biomarker that is expressed independently of spermatozoa, it remains useful in identifying semen from vasectomized and azoospermic males.|$|E

25|$|Lavdas et al. (2006) {{investigated}} whether sustained expression <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> on Schwann cells enhances their migration. Schwann {{cells were}} tranduced with a retroviral vector encoding STX {{in order to}} induce PSA expression. PSA-expressing Schwann cells did obtain enhanced motility as demonstrated in a gap bridging assay and after grafting in postnatal forebrain slice cultures. PSA expression did not alter molecular and morphological differentiation. The PSA-expressing Schwann cells were able to myelinate CNS axons in cerebellar slices, which is not normally possible in vivo. It is hopeful that these PSA-expressing Schwann cells {{will be able to}} migrate throughout the CNS without loss of myelinating abilities and may become useful for regeneration and myelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|PSA {{can also}} be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum {{threshold}} of interpretation to rule out false positive results and conclusively state that semen is present. While traditional tests such as crossover electrophoresis have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical prostate cancer screening methods have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4ng/mL. This level of antigen {{has been shown to be}} present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk. No studies have been performed to assess the PSA levels in the tissues and secretions of pre-pubescent children. Therefore, the presence <b>of</b> <b>PSA</b> from a high sensitivity (4ng/mL) test cannot conclusively identify the presence of semen, so care must be taken with the interpretation of such results.|$|E

40|$|Objective: No {{previous}} study has reported {{the numbers of}} prostate cancer (PC) patients existing among a normal Japanese population with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 4 ng/ml. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the performance <b>of</b> %free <b>PSA</b> as a screening tool for a normal Japanese population with <b>PSA</b> <b>of</b> 2 â 4 ng/ml and to examine the characteristics of cancer detected using this criterion. Methods: We conducted a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the performance <b>of</b> %free <b>PSA</b> among a normal Japanese population. We decided on a %free <b>PSA</b> cutoff value <b>of</b> 12 % according to the preliminary results. A total of 5548 consecutive screening volunteers aged 50 â 79 years were enrolled in the project. Men with total PSA. 4 ng/ml, or men with total <b>PSA</b> <b>of</b> 2 â 4 ng/ml and %free <b>PSA</b> <b>of</b> 12 % were indicated to undergo 12 core biopsies. Results: There were 826 (14. 9 %) men with <b>PSA</b> <b>of</b> 2 â 4 ng/ml. Among them, those with %free <b>PSA</b> <b>of</b> 12 % numbered 100 (12. 1 %). Forty-nine out of 100 men (49 %) received biopsy, and 16 PC patients were detected. Among 10 patients undergoing radical prosta-tectomy, seven were associated with extra-prostatic extension (pT 3) or high-grade cancer (Gleason score 8).
