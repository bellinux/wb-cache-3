30|$|Candida albicans causing {{candidiasis}} can {{be classified}} as superficial (vaginal <b>thrush,</b> <b>oral</b> and chronic mucocutaneous) and deep-seated (Candida myocarditis and Candida septicemia) {{and is one of}} the major clinical problems in India [3]. In United States, C. albicans is the causative of the fourth most hospital-acquired infection and US $ 1 billion has been spent for the treatment annually. Progress of an infection leads to growth of fungal masses in the brain, heart and kidney contaminating indwelling catheters and finally enters the blood stream causing candidaemia. The dimorphic transition from yeast to mycelia form leads to the pathogenicity [4, 5].|$|R

We report two cases of hepatotoxicity due to prescribed medications. An infant was given 15 &#x 2009;mL instead of 1. 5 &#x 2009;mL of paracetamol by his mother because she omitted the decimal point on the label of the drug bottle. The infant became symptomatic, and liver enzyme and clotting profile were abnormal, necessitating treatment with N-acetyl cysteine. Another infant was prescribed <b>oral</b> ketoconazole for <b>thrush,</b> resulting in elevation of liver enzymes.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Candida albicans {{to several}} fatty acids and their 1 -monoglycerides was tested {{with a short}} inactivation time, and ultrathin sections were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after treatment with capric acid. The results show that capric acid, a 10 -carbon saturated fatty acid, causes the fastest and most effective killing of all three strains of C. albicans tested, leaving the cytoplasm disorganized and shrunken because of a disrupted or disintegrated plasma membrane. Lauric acid, a 12 -carbon saturated fatty acid, was the most active at lower concentrations and after a longer incubation time. Candida albicans is normally present in small numbers in the oral cavity, lower gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. Most C. albicans infections are caused by endogenous flora exept in cases of direct mucosal contact with lesions, for example, through sexual intercourse. With a breakdown of host defenses, the organism can produce diseases ranging from superficial skin or mucous membrane infections, e. g., <b>oral</b> le-sions called <b>thrush</b> and vaginal candidiasis, to systemic involve-ment of multiple organs.

40|$|Candida albicans is a mucosal {{commensal}} organism {{capable of}} causing superficial (<b>oral</b> and vaginal <b>thrush)</b> infections in immune normal hosts, {{but is a}} major pathogen causing systemic and mucosal infections in immunocompromised individuals. Azoles have been very effective anti-fungal agents and the mainstay in treating opportunistic mold and yeast infections. Azole resistant strains have emerged compromising the utility of this class of drugs. It {{has been shown that}} azole resistance can be reversed by the co-administration of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suggesting that resistance is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms possibly involving Hos 2, a fungal deacetylase. We report here the cloning and functional characterization of HOS 2 (HighOsmolarity Sensitive), a gene coding for fungal histone deacetylase from C. albicans. Inhibition studies showed that Hos 2 is susceptible to pan inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), but is not inhibited by class I inhibitors such as MS- 275. This in vitro enzymatic assay, which is amenable to high throughput could be used for screening potent fungal Hos 2 inhibitors that could be a potential anti-fungal adjuvant. Purified Hos 2 protein consistently deacetylated tubulins, rather than histones from TSA-treated cells. Hos 2 has been reported to be a putative NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase, a feature of sirtuins.

40|$|Background The {{single most}} {{important}} risk factor for postpartum maternal infection is cesarean section. Although guidelines endorse the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing cesarean section, there is not uniform implementation of this recommendation. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995 and last updated in 2010. Objectives To assess the effects of prophylactic antibiotics compared with no prophylactic antibiotics on infectious complications in women undergoing cesarean section. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014) and reference lists of retrieved papers. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effects of prophylactic antibiotics versus no treatment in women undergoing cesarean section. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. The clinically important primary outcomes were wound infection, endometritis, serious maternal infectious complications and adverse effects on the infant. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) and combined trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 95 studies enrolling over 15, 000 women. Compared with placebo or no treatment, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the incidence of wound infection (RR 0. 40, 95 % CI 0. 35 to 0. 46, 82 studies, 14, 407 women), endometritis (RR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 42, 83 studies, 13, 548 women) and maternal serious infectious complications (RR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 20 to 0. 49, 32 studies, 6159 women). When only studies that included women undergoing an elective cesarean section were analyzed, {{there was also a}} reduction in the incidence of wound infections (RR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 47 to 0. 82, 17 studies, 3537 women) and endometritis (RR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 61, 15 studies, 2502 women) with prophylactic antibiotics. Similar estimates of effect were seen whether the antibiotics were administered before the cord was clamped or after. The effect of different antibiotic regimens was studied and similar reductions in the incidence of infections were seen for most of the antibiotics and combinations. There were no data on which to estimate the effect of maternal administration of antibiotics on infant outcomes. No studies systematically collected and reported on adverse infant outcomes nor the effect of antibiotics on the developing infant immune system. No studies reported on the incidence of <b>oral</b> candidiasis (<b>thrush)</b> in babies. Maternal adverse effects were also rarely described. We judged the evidence for antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment to be of moderate quality; most studies lacked an adequate description of methods and were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias.

5000|$|Corticosteroids: Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} (i.e. fluticasone, budesonide) {{are typically}} used when bronchoconstrictive disease has advanced to a persistent inflammatory state, more specifically in persistent or severe asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). These medications decrease immune system activity {{which in turn}} will decrease swelling of the airways, decrease airway resistance, and increase delivery of air to the alveoli during respiration. Unlike the SABAs, these medications do not provide relief of acute symptoms or asthmatic attacks, and their benefits are typically only seen after 3-4 weeks of therapy. Due to this delayed therapeutic response, it is absolutely essential that patients who are prescribed corticosteroids for respiratory disease are adherent to their medication regimen. In the ISOLDE trial, fluticasone therapy decreased the frequency of COPD exacerbations and the rate of health decline in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD; however, had little effect in decreasing the rate of FEV1 decline. Patients should be counseled to wash their mouth following use of inhaled corticosteroids to decrease the risk of developing <b>oral</b> <b>thrush,</b> a common side effect of these medications.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little {{information}} is available on real-life occurrence of <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> in COPD patients treated with ICS. We investigated <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> incidence in COPD patients prescribed FDC ICS/LABA therapies and assessed whether it is modulated by the ICS type, dose, and delivery device. METHODS: We conducted a historical, observational, matched cohort study (one baseline year before and one outcome year after initiation of therapy) {{using data from the}} UK Optimum Patient Care Research Database. We assessed <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> incidence in patients initiating long-acting bronchodilators or FDC ICS/LABA therapy. We then compared different combination therapies (budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate [BUD/FOR] and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate [FP/SAL]) and devices (DPI and pMDI). RESULTS: Patients prescribed FDC ICS/LABA had significantly greater odds of experiencing <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> than those prescribed long-acting bronchodilators alone (adjusted OR 2. 18 [95 % CI 1. 84 - 2. 59]). Significantly fewer patients prescribed BUD/FOR DPI developed <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> compared with FP/SAL DPI (OR 0. 77 [0. 63 - 0. 94]) when allowing for differences in prescribed doses between the drugs. A significantly smaller proportion of patients developed <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> in the FP/SAL pMDI arm than in the FP/SAL DPI arm (OR 0. 67 [0. 55 - 0. 82]). Additionally, in the FP/SAL cohort (both DPI and pMDI), increased risk of <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> was significantly associated with high ICS daily dose (OR 1. 97 [1. 22 - 3. 17] vs low daily dose). CONCLUSIONS: ICS use increases <b>oral</b> <b>thrush</b> incidence in COPD and this effect is dose-dependent for FP/SAL therapies. Of the therapies assessed, FP/SAL pMDI and BUD/FOR DPI may be more protective against <b>oral</b> <b>thrush...</b>|$|E
