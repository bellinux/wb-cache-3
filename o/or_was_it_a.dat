500|$|In 2009, {{following}} {{the announcement that}} As the World Turns would be cancelled in 2010, rumors that Howarth would return to OLTL regained momentum. The rumors were further fueled by an August 2010 episode of OLTL, in which Howarth's picture was shown and a delirious Téa stated that the current Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This resulted in what Dan Kroll of the website Soap Opera Central.com described as fans [...] "rac to their computers {{to figure out the}} meaning of the scene". Kroll speculated that the scene was [...] "crafted merely to get fans talking, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> hint to viewers something big was coming down the pike?" [...] Soap Opera Network, citing unnamed sources and pointing to the 2010 episode, reported on their website that they had [...] "learned exclusively Howarth [...] indeed be returning" [...] to the series in the near future. Soap Opera Digest columnist Carolyn Hinsey dismissed the report, stating on her Facebook page, [...] "Seriously, stop with the Howarth misinformation here please. [...] He is not coming back to OLTL. Case closed." [...] Some fans were convinced that St. John's character was an impostor, while others were not; although Howarth eventually returned as Todd in 2011, his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play, Todd Manning or a new character.|$|E
