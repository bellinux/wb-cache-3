40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a test for the {{specification}} of a structural model without identifying assumptions. We show the equiva-lence of three natural definitions of correct specification, which we take as our null hypothesis. Using a representation of the null hypothesis as a Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transportation, we show that the nat-ural test statistic is a form <b>of</b> <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> <b>statistic</b> for Choquet capacities. When the model is given in parametric form, the test can be inverted to yield confidence intervals for the identified parameter set. The approach can be applied to areas as diverse as the estimation of models with sample selection, censored observables and to games with multiple equilibria...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I present {{computational}} {{procedures to}} obtian statistical tables. The tables of the asymptotic distribution and the exact distribution <b>of</b> <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> <b>statistic</b> D_n for one population, {{the table of}} the distribution of the runs R, the table {{of the distribution of}} Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic W^+ and the table of the distribution of Mann-Whitney statistic U_x using Mathematica, Version 3. 9 under Window 98. I think that it is an interesting cuestion because many statistical packages give the asymptotic significance level in the statistical tests and with these porcedures one can easily calculate the exact significance levels and the left-tail and right-tail probabilities with non-parametric distributions. I have used mathematica to make these calculations because one can use symbolic language to solve recursion relations. It's very easy to generate the format of the tables, and it's possible to obtain any table of the mentioned non-parametric distributions with any precision, not only with the standard parameters more used in Statistics, and without transcription mistakes. Furthermore, using similar procedures, we can generate tables for the following distribution functions: Binomial, Poisson, Hypergeometric, Normal, x^ 2 Chi-Square, T-Student, F-Snedecor, Geometric, Gamma and Beta. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a clustering problem where we observe feature vectors Xi ∈ Rp, i = 1, 2, [...] ., n, from several possible classes. The class labels are unknown {{and the main}} interest is to estimate these labels. We propose a three-step clustering procedure where we first evaluate the significance of each feature by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, then we select the small fraction of features for which the Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores exceed a preselected threshold t 3 ̆e 0, and then use only the selected features for clustering by one version of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this procedure, {{one of the main}} challenges is how to set the threshold t. We propose a new approach to set the threshold, where the core is the so-called Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in post-selection PCA. SNR is reminiscent of the recent innovation of Higher Criticism; for this reason, we call the proposed threshold the Higher Criticism Threshold (HCT), despite that it is significantly different from the HCT proposed earlier by [Donoho 2008] in the context of classification. Motivated by many examples in Big Data, we study the spectral clustering with HCT for a model where the signals are both rare and weak for two-classes clustering case. Through delicate PCA, we forge a close link between the HCT and the ideal threshold choice, and show that the HCT yields optimal results in the spectral clustering approach. The approach is successfully applied to three gene microarray data sets, where it compares favorably with existing clustering methods. Our analysis is subtle and requires new development in the Random Matrix Theory (RMT). One challenge we face is that most results in the RMT can not be applied directly to our case: existing results are usually for matrices with i. i. d. entries, but the object of interest in the current case is the post-selection data matrix, where (due to feature selection) the columns are non-independent and have hard-to-track distributions. We develop intricate new RMT to overcome this problem. We also find the theoretical approximation for the tail distribution <b>of</b> <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> <b>Statistic</b> under null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. With the theoretical approximation, we can claim the effectiveness of KS statistic. Besides, we also find the fundamental limits for clustering problem, signal recovery problem, and detection problem under the Asymptotic Rare and Weak model. We find the boundary such that when the model parameters are beyond the boundary, then the inference is unavailable, otherwise there are some methods (usually exhausted search) to achieve the inference...|$|E

Two approximations to {{the distribution of}} T have been implemented in popular software and are widely used in evaluating various models. It {{is important to know}} how accurate these approximations are when compared {{to each other and to}} the exact distribution of T. The paper systematically studies the quality of the two approximations and examines the effect of λi’s and the degrees of freedom d by analysis and Monte Carlo. The results imply that one approximation can be as good as the exact distribution when d is large. When the coefficient of variation of the λi’s is small, another approximation is also adequate for practical model inference.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{statistical models}} {{which have been}} proposed for luminosity distributions for the globular clusters in the Milky Way and M 31. Although earlier research showed that the cluster luminosity functions in those two galaxies were well fit by Gaussian distributions, subsequent investigations suggested that their luminosities followed t- rather than Gaussian distributions. By applying the Bayesian Information Criterion, we find moderate statistical evidence that the t-distribution is superior to the Gaussian distribution {{as a model of}} luminosity distribution for the Milky Way. In the case of M 31, we find moderate evidence that the Gaussian distribution is superior to the t-distribution. Our conclusion is that in neither case do we find strong evidence to support the use of one distribution over the other as a statistical model for the luminosities of the globular clusters in the Galaxy and M 31. Moreover, we urge caution in the use <b>of</b> the <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> <b>statistic</b> to justify the choice of statistical models for globular cluster luminosity functions. 1...|$|R

3000|$|The purpose <b>of</b> {{introducing}} the <b>Kolmogorov–Smirnov</b> <b>statistic</b> (KSS) {{is to find}} the preferable customers to visit (when moving from one solution to a neighbouring one), taking into to account their geographical positions in the instance. The idea is simple: (1) select the model that minimizes the distance criterion, (2) deduce its parameters and (3) decide whether two customers are neighbours or not. The customers are considered neighbours of a given customer i, if and only if the distance between them is less or equal to a given parameter A_i. This parameter is calculated by using the pth quantile formula, which depends on the probability distribution of its distance sample L_i. The use of such a probability aspect in computing A_i is justified by the aim of checking whether one of the known distributions can be suited to each distance sample. In fact, the KSS fits the distance sample by selecting a list of candidate distributions, estimating their parameters and giving their ranking. Once the best statistical model is identified, the parameter A_i is defined as follows: F(A_i) = [...] (L_i < A_i) = p [...] A_i = F^- 1 (p).|$|R
