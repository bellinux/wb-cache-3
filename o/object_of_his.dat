5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) {{suspects}} Mitchell's new assistant, Broderick (Jeremy Rowley), has a {{crush on}} Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), which he denies but secretly affirms. His suspicion is soon proven wrong when Broderick hugs Cameron in an elevator revealing {{that he is the}} real <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> desire. While eating dinner together, Cameron reveals this to Mitchell, who still believes Broderick has {{a crush on}} him. To see which one is right, the two go to Broderick's house, but after getting a text from Broderick which says he is quitting, the two decide it would be best if they never knew which one of them Broderick liked.|$|E
25|$|The long {{instrumental}} {{is indicative}} of the theme of the music video where the protagonist is serenading his guitar as the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> {{the pivotal}} <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{darkness}} was comparative, not absolute, for gradually all <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> environment became again visible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here,' {{answered}} the voices; and, {{pushing through the}} brambles in that direction, he came near the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> search.|$|R
25|$|Returning to Rome about April 1344 {{he worked}} for three years at the great <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, the {{restoration}} of the city to its former position of power. He gathered together a band of supporters, plans were drawn up, and at length all was ready for the insurrection.|$|E
25|$|On 24 March 1810, the {{inhabitants}} of St Thomas presented Lieutenant Edward F. Dwyer with a gift of 140 guineas to purchase a sword or such other <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choosing as a token of their appreciation for his service as commander of Elizabeth while she served as a guardship there.|$|E
25|$|Saadia Gaon was {{a pioneer}} in the fields in which he toiled. The {{foremost}} <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work was the Bible; his importance is due primarily to his establishment of a new school of Biblical exegesis characterized by a rational investigation of the contents of the Bible and a scientific knowledge of the language of the holy text.|$|E
50|$|Discrete {{subgroups of}} Lie {{groups have been}} the central <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> researches. He has made {{contributions}} to rigidity and arithmeticity problems.|$|R
60|$|You say Jefferson Davis is on a {{visit to}} Hood. I judge that Brown and Stephens are the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> visit.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{practice is}} {{the construction of}} immersive installations, which include painted walls and floors, <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own design, and found furniture.|$|R
25|$|Pepé {{describes}} Penelope {{as lucky}} to be the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections, and uses a romantic paradigm to explain his failures to seduce her. For example, he describes a hammer blow to his head {{as a form of}} flirtation rather than rejection. Accordingly, he shows no sign of narcissistic injury or loss of confidence {{no matter how many times}} he is rebuffed.|$|E
25|$|In Wall, Tristan {{sees the}} star fall and vows to {{retrieve}} it for the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly takes the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her {{to take her home}} to Victoria.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} understand, it is immensely {{important}} {{for the person who}} understands to be located outside the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, and because they are others.|$|E
50|$|The {{poor and}} the sick were the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> special care; for their support he founded {{hospitals}} and endowed others already existing.|$|R
60|$|These {{agreeable}} reflections {{occurred to}} Ralph Nickleby, as sundry small caresses and endearments, {{supposed to be}} unseen, were exchanged between the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{tribes are}} fonder {{of the chase}} than of the arts of men of labor," [...] {{returned}} the unconscious Duncan, still gazing at the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wonder.|$|R
25|$|The rest of {{the book}} loosely follows the {{original}} Phantom of the Opera novel - differing on several points but following the relationship between Erik and the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> desire, Christine Daae, and switching {{back and forth between}} their points of view. The relationship between Christine and Erik is explored in greater detail and with greater compassion than the original novel, allowing Erik to finally find love and redemption in a world that has shown him nothing but cruelty since birth.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, August Köhler {{graduated}} with a teaching degree and subsequently taught at gymnasiums in Darmstadt and Bingen before going back to university. He started his academic career as a student, instructor and assistant to professor J.W. Spengel at the Zoological Institute at the University of Giessen, Germany. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctorate thesis was the taxonomy of limpets, a project that depended heavily on microscopic imaging and prompted Köhler into trying {{to improve the quality}} of images taken via photomicrography. The result of this work was published in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Having {{achieved}} the chief <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, Alexander {{spent the last}} decade of his life consolidating his position in Ross. His charters seem to indicate that he was chiefly based at the castles of Dingwall and Inverness, and rarely anywhere else. The large number of charters issued by Alexander at Inverness is probably explained by his role as Justiciar of Scotia. Alexander's move east led to less direct lordship in the west, his original political heartland. Alexander's bastard sons Uisdean (Hugh of Sleat) and Gilleasbaig ("Celestine") were given Sleat and Lochalsh respectively, Domhnall Ballach became more independent in Islay and Kintyre, Clan MacLeod kindred took greater control in Skye and Lewis, Clan MacLean greater control in Mull and Clan MacKintosh greater control in Lochaber.|$|E
50|$|Ian Keith plays a French {{military}} attaché in Madrid who romantically pursues {{the wives}} of various government officials. Betty Compson and Mary Duncan play the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} doubted, {{though the}} manner of the {{dispensation}} be so mysterious! Barbarians in their habits, and ruthless in their enmities, they are creatures of our nature, and equally <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> care." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the stairs}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{apartment}} {{there was the}} lamentation {{of the old and}} infirm, and the sobbing <b>of</b> women; poor <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> charity to whom he had never turned a deaf ear, even when struggling himself with poverty.|$|R
25|$|Invited (on Ocampo's initiative) by the Amigos del Arte {{society of}} Buenos Aires, Fondane left for Argentina and Uruguay in summer 1929. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> visit was {{promoting}} French cinema {{with a set}} of lectures in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and other cities (as he later stated in a Rampa interview with Sarina Cassvan-Pas, he introduced South Americans to the work of Germaine Dulac, Luis Buñuel and Henri Gad). In this context, Fondane met essayist Eduardo Mallea, who invited him to contribute in La Nacións literary supplement. His other activities there included conferencing on Shestov at the University of Buenos Aires and publishing articles on several subjects (from Shestov's philosophy to the poems of Tzara), but the fees received in return were, in his own account, too small {{to cover the cost of}} decent living.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, {{and even then}} {{he appears to have}} taken this step at the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. The <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, the daughter of a Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to have been happy, though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1583 Paget {{travelled}} from Rouen secretly into England, using the pseudonym Mope. It is alleged that the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> journey was to concert measures for an invasion by the Duke of Guise and the King of Scots. For a time he hid {{in the house of}} William Davies, at Patching, Sussex. On 8 September he had an interview at Petworth with Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. He was afterwards secretly conveyed to a lodge in the Earl's park called Conigar Lodge, where he stayed for about eight days. His brother, Thomas, was also summoned to Petworth. On 16 September Paget met in a wood, called Patching Copse, with William Shelley, who was subsequently convicted of treason. Paget likely also met at this time with Lord Henry Howard, who had come to Sussex from Norfolk.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{death of}} Frederic was mourned {{even by the}} cities which so long had been the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hostility, and the victims <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vengeance. All the Lombards--even the Milanese--acknowledged his rare courage, his {{constancy}} in misfortune--his generosity in conquest.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.395]and of {{the walking}} round the Caaba {{a certain number}} of times in a devout manner, every one has also his own {{separate}} prayers to put up, and so to fulfil the conditions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vow and the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> particular pilgrimage.” ...|$|R
60|$|As a nepotist Sixtus {{was almost}} {{unsurpassed}} {{in the history}} of the Papacy. Four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephews and their aggrandizement were the particular <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attentions, and two of these--as we have already said--Piero and Girolamo Riario, were universally recognized to be his sons.|$|R
25|$|Riis was in much demand as a carpenter, a {{major reason}} being the low prices he charged. However, his {{employers}} exploited his efficiency and low prices, and Riis returned to New York City. He was most successful as a salesman, particularly of flatirons and fluting irons, becoming promoted to sales representative of them for Illinois. However, in Chicago he was cheated of both his money and his stock, and {{had to return to}} an earlier base in Pittsburgh. There he found that his subordinates he had left to sell in Pennsylvania had cheated him in the same manner. He again had little money, and while bedridden with a fever learned from a letter that Elisabeth, the former <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affection, was engaged to a cavalry officer. Riis then returned to New York by selling flatirons along the way.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time making a point of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope {{to stand up to the}} beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring that he makes no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do precisely that. Shakespeare's sonnet aims to do the opposite, by indicating that his mistress is the ideal <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E
25|$|Mr and Mrs Boffin {{attempt to}} adopt a young orphan, {{previously}} {{in the care of}} his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and has tracked the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affections. Bradley Headstone attempts to enlist the help of Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, to find Lizzie. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{displays}} some of Sarmiento's belongings, as {{established by}} Law #12556. In 1913 his grandchildren donated other <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> to the collection. The museum's collection contains furniture, and various sets of cuttlery {{obtained by the}} president during his travels.|$|R
60|$|Creep up {{and watch}} them? Would Chingachgook {{have taken a}} risk like that? Hardly, unless insured with some good company. Then what? He was still {{undecided}} when he perceived the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attention emerging. He backed a little farther into the bushes.|$|R
60|$|Looking {{carefully}} round, the Jew {{at length}} discovered the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> search,--Francisco, Lucien, and Mariano Rimini. The two first were seated side by side, eating their meagre meal. Mariano lay near them, heavily laden with irons, and also endeavouring to eat.|$|R
