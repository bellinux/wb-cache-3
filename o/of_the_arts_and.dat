5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, a hallmark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival {{there is}} no record of further {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before the discovery of the music manuscript in the 19th century. The discovery of this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> <b>and</b> opera in particular.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, the University {{underwent}} significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it {{developed into a}} major research university. For much of the 19th century, the University consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> <b>and</b> the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously {{a part of the}} Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.|$|E

5|$|Elected king of Poland in 1632, Władysław {{was fairly}} {{successful}} in defending the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against invasion, {{most notably in}} the Smolensk War of 1632–34, in which he participated personally. He supported religious tolerance and carried out military reforms, such as {{the founding of the}} Commonwealth Navy. He was also a renowned patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> music. He failed, however, to realize his dreams of regaining the Swedish crown, gaining fame by defeating the Ottoman Empire, strengthening royal power, and reforming the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the city {{can be traced back}} to the second half of the eighteenth century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Białystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.|$|E
5|$|In England, Anne {{shifted her}} {{energies}} from factional politics to patronage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> constructed her own magnificent court, hosting {{one of the}} richest cultural salons in Europe. After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have been a Protestant {{at the time of her}} death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.|$|E

5|$|Over {{a six-year}} period, {{government}} {{funding for the}} arts was increased {{by a factor of}} seven and in 1978, the South Australian Film Corporation commenced work. During Dunstan's time in charge, acclaimed films such as Breaker Morant, Picnic at Hanging Rock and Storm Boy were made in the state. Dunstan's support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> fine dining was credited by commentators with attracting artists, craftspeople and writers into the state, helping to change its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding {{took over}} ten years and was {{supervised}} by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. The architect Sir Christopher Wren {{was involved in the}} rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and more than fifty London churches. King Charles ll did much to foster the rebuilding work. He was a patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> sciences and founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a renaissance in the arts and sciences in England.|$|E

After graduation, he attended Boston University and began auditioning for acting schools. He was turned down by several schools, including Juilliard, and twice by Carnegie-Mellon, before being accepted at the California Institute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> moving to California, where he worked in restaurant kitchens and as a Fuller Brush salesman.|$|E

5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation. From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo {{was the best}} candidate to develop the style he had in mind– which would draw from the best Disney hand-drawn classics of the 1950s, the Disney Little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design– and persuaded {{him to come back}} to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen. Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> <b>and</b> Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E
5|$|Stanisław II Augustus (also Stanisław August Poniatowski; born Stanisław Antoni Poniatowski; 17 January 1732 – 12 February 1798) was {{the last}} King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and the last monarch of the united Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1764–95). He remains a {{controversial}} figure in Polish history. Recognized as a great patron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> sciences and an initiator and firm supporter of progressive reforms, he is also remembered as the last king of the Commonwealth whose election was marred by Russian involvement. He is criticized primarily for his failure to stand against the partitions, and thus to prevent the destruction of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Getty Villa {{is one of}} two {{locations}} of the J. Paul Getty Museum.
