25|$|Paris had arguably {{been the}} {{classical}} music {{capital of the}} world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, Erik Satie, collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad, scandalous ballet called Parade. First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> serious issues with.|$|E
25|$|MBO {{situations}} {{lead management}} teams often into a dilemma as {{they face a}} conflict of interest, being interested in a low purchase price personally {{while at the same}} time being employed by the owners who <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> an interest in a high purchase price. Owners usually react to this situation by offering a deal fee to the management team if a certain price threshold is reached. Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E

I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E

25|$|Beeching's reports made no {{recommendations}} {{about the}} handling of land after closures. British Rail operated a policy of disposing of land that was surplus to requirements. Many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and the land sold for development. Closed station buildings on remaining lines have often been demolished or sold for housing or other purposes. Increasing pressure on land use meant that protection of closed trackbeds, as in other countries (such as the US Rail Bank scheme, which holds former railway land for possible future use) was not seen to be practical. Many redundant structures from closed lines remain, such as bridges over other lines and drainage culverts. They often require maintenance {{as part of the}} rail infrastructure while providing no benefit. Critics of Beeching argue that the lack of recommendations on {{the handling of}} closed railway property demonstrates that the report was short-sighted. On the other hand, retaining a railway on these routes, which would <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> increased maintenance costs, might not have earned enough to justify that greater cost. As demand for rail has grown since privatisation, the failure to preserve the routes of closed lines (such as the one between Bedford and Cambridge, which was closed despite Beeching recommending its retention) has been criticised.|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, {{were less}} {{reserved}} in their {{praise of the}} narrative—The Electric Playground {{referred to it as}} [...] "a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose"—but agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. The Adrenaline Vault's Mike Laidlaw stated that [...] "the folks at Crystal Dynamics <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> no kindness in their heart for game reviewers trying desperately to describe the plot". Journalists also commonly cited Soul Reaver 2s poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opined that [...] "the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there" [...] and Fielder warned that play [...] "burns bright, but not as long as you'd like".|$|E

Carter confirmed to Gillian Reagan of Business Insider that in his research, he tried to gather information from multiple viewpoints. He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone I possibly can to get every side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E
500|$|The Tunnel {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated that while remakes are [...] "often underwhelming", The Tunnel was [...] "gripping stuff", {{and he believed}} that viewers [...] "should find plenty to enjoy" [...] in the series. The performances of Dillane and Poésy were also lauded. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent was positive in his assessment of the series, stating that [...] "as an avid fan of The Bridge, I am happy to report that The Tunnel works well {{in its own right}} – it's intelligently made, well cast and ambitiously cinematic", adding that it had [...] "succeeded in its high-risk strategy of re-working a near-flawless Scandi-drama in our Anglo-French image". Ellen E Jones, also of The Independent, said that Dillane and Poésy's performances [...] "stuck closely" [...] to the original characterisation of the leads from the Scandinavian version. Of the execution, Jones stated: [...] "should you bother watching The Tunnel even if you've already seen the original? The early signs are good. The makers <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> sense enough to preserve what was effective about the original, and invention enough to distinguish their work too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early rulings {{suggested}} that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers. In State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., , the Supreme Court recognized that [...] "Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> been unconstitutional" [...] {{for a state}} to require a license and fee to import beer anywhere within its borders. First, the Court held that Section 2 abrogated the right to import intoxicating liquors free of a direct burden on interstate commerce, which {{otherwise would have been}} unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause before passage of the Twenty-first Amendment. In its second holding, the Court rejected an equal protection claim because [...] "A classification recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth." [...] Over time, the Court has significantly curtailed this initial interpretation.|$|E

2500|$|Treatment by {{surgical}} intervention can <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> {{the most}} immediate impact, again however, {{it is not a}} cure-all. [...] In patients that have cerebral palsy as the cause of their athetosis, it has been demonstrated that a subthalamotomy tends to help relieve the extent of athetosis in approximately half of patients. [...] Additionally, late 19th and early 20th century surgical accounts state that athetosis can be relieved by the removal of a part of the cerebral motor cortex or by cutting a part of the posterior spinal roots. [...] Patients who undergo surgical treatment to relieve the athetosis often see significant improvement in the control of their limbs and digits. [...] While surgery is often very beneficial in the short term and can produce near immediate results, in the long term it has been seen that its effects are not incredibly long lasting.|$|E
2500|$|The black {{field of}} his [...] "shield for peace" [...] is well {{documented}} (see Arms above). However, there is no sound evidence that Edward ever wore black armour, although John Harvey (without citing a source) refers to [...] "some rather shadowy evidence that he was described in French as clad {{at the battle of}} Crecy ' en armure noire en fer bruni ' – in black armour of burnished steel". Richard Barber suggests that the name's origins may have lain in pageantry, in that a tradition may have grown up in the 15th century of representing the prince in black armour. He points out that several chronicles refer to him as Edward the Fourth (the title he would have taken as King had he outlived his father): this name would <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> become confusing when the actual Edward IV succeeded in 1461, and this may have been the period when an alternative had to be found.|$|E
2500|$|Governor Mitt Romney said he {{disagreed}} with the SJC's decision, but [...] "We <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> to follow the law as provided by the Supreme Judicial Court, even if we don't agree with it". He said he would work with the legislature to draft a law [...] "consistent" [...] with the ruling. He also backed {{an amendment to the}} state constitution to define marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman while also providing by statute [...] "basic civil rights and appropriate benefits to same-sex couples and other nontraditional relationships." [...] Romney quickly joined legislators in attempting to satisfy the Goodridge decision by creating civil unions for same-sex couples. His views were recognized as an attempt to establish his record on a controversial issue while planning to run for the Republican nomination for president. Former Governor Weld took credit for laying the groundwork for the decision: [...] "A lot of the stuff we did foreshadowed the opinion." [...] He said: [...] "It is a thunderbolt, but a thunderbolt correctly heard." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crassus and Pompey {{shared a}} consulship in 70 BC. Plutarch {{regarded}} this as having being dull and uneventful {{because it was}} marred by continuous disagreement between the two men. He wrote that they [...] "differed on almost every measure, and by their contentiousness rendered their consulship barren politically and without achievement, except that Crassus made a great sacrifice in honour of Hercules and gave the people a great feast and an allowance of grain for three months." [...] The deep enmity during this consulship was also noted by Appian. Plutarch also wrote that Pompey gave the people back their tribunate. This was {{a reference to the}} repeal of laws introduced by Lucius Cornelius Sulla (an optimate) in 81 BC that had emasculated the power of the plebeian tribunes, the representatives of the plebeians (the commoners). Sulla had curbed the power of this tribunate by banning it from presenting bills to the vote of the plebeian council and from vetoing the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta. He also forbade those who had held this tribunate from running for public offices. Sulla had done this because these tribunes had challenged the supremacy of the patrician-controlled senate and he wanted to strengthen the power of the latter. Since these tribunes were the representatives {{of the majority of the}} citizens, the people were unhappy with this. Plutarch attributed this repeal to Pompey alone. However, it is very likely that the optimates would have opposed this in the senate. Therefore, it is unlikely that this measure could have been passed if the two consuls had disagreed and opposed each other on this issue. They must have been united in getting this motion passed. Livy’s Periochae (a short summary of Livy's work) recorded that [...] "Marcus Crassus and Gnaeus Pompey were made consuls ... and reconstituted the tribunician powers." [...] Similarly, Suetonius wrote that when Caesar was a military tribune, [...] "he ardently supported the leaders in the attempt to re-establish the authority of the tribunes of the commons , the extent of which Sulla had curtailed." [...] The two leaders must <b>obviously</b> <b>have</b> been the two consuls, Crassus and Pompey. Therefore, on this issue there must have been unity of purpose between these three men. This was an issue of great importance to the populares.|$|E
