It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. <b>Optical</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Reading</b> (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for data capture.

40|$|It {{is cheap}} to process {{epidemiological}} data from <b>optical</b> <b>mark</b> <b>read</b> (OMR) questionnaires. Respondents should use a pencil to complete OMR questionnaires, but many will not unless these are supplied. Sending pencils and erasers is expensive. Does sending pencils and erasers increase {{the response rate}} as cost-effectively as sending reminders, or does this decrease the error rate and offset data checking costs? We mailed 300 smokers and half were randomised to receive pencils and erasers. The relative risk (95 % confidence intervals) for the response rate for the pencil group relative to the non-pencil group was 0. 77 (0. 46 - 1. 29) and for the error rate was 1. 31 (0. 78 - 2. 21). Sending pencils and erasers was not cost-effective in sensitivity analysis with any response rate or using the confidence intervals. Including pencils with mailed epidemiological questionnaires probably has no benefit and any plausible benefit does not offset the costs of sending pencils and erasers...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the high {{accuracy}} of the existing <b>optical</b> <b>mark</b> <b>reading</b> (OMR) systems and devices, a few restrictions remain existent. In this work, we aim to reduce the restrictions of multiple choice questions (MCQ) within tests. We use an image registration technique to extract the answer boxes from the answer sheets. Unlike other systems that rely on simple image processing steps to recognize the extracted answer boxes, we address the problem from another perspective by training a classifier to recognize the class of each answer box (i. e. confirmed, crossed out, and blank answer). This gives us the {{ability to deal with}} a variety of shading and mark patterns, and distinguish between chosen and canceled answers. All existing machine learning techniques require a large number of examples in order to train the classifier, therefore we present a dataset that consists of five real MCQ tests and a quiz that have different answer sheet templates. We evaluate two strategies of classification: a straight-forward approach and a two-stage classifier approach. We test two handcrafted feature methods and a convolutional neural network. At the end, we present an easy-to-use graphical user interface of the proposed system. Compared with existing OMR systems, the proposed system is considered of a higher accuracy and the least constraints. We believe that the presented work will further direct the development of OMR systems towards template-free MCQ tests without restrictions. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, 5 table...|$|E
