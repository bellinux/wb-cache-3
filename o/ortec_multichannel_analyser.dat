40|$|Obtaining a good {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (S/N) {{is of great}} importance in tunneling spectroscopy, as it has often led {{to the discovery of}} new phenomena. The quantities of interest are the derivatives of the tunnel junction I-V curve; the usual approach to obtain these characteristics is to apply a modulation voltage around a D. C. bias and to detect the proper harmonic with a lock-in detector. In order to improve the S/N ratio, one would think of increasing the detector time-constant (and total sweep time), but experimentalists know that, above a few seconds, such an increase is illusive and even misleading. This is because there are low frequency instabilities in the equipment, but also because there is noise present in the junction characteristic itself. The combined use of a lock-in detector and a <b>multichannel</b> <b>analyser</b> is proposed, in order to average a large number (n) of short sweeps instead of using one single long sweep. The S/N ratio is calculated for such an experiment, and it is found that it depends strongly upon the noise spectral density.

A system for adapting a commercial multichannel to the plotting of junction characteristics is described, and experiments are performed that demonstrate the advantages of this method.

40|$|Nowadays one of {{the most}} {{complicated}} challenges for Nuclear Industry is to ensure a safe and efficient decommissioning of nuclear facilities. With the term decommissioning we usually describe the process, {{at the end of life}} of facility, starting after the defueling and coolant removal. One of the most relevant activities related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities is the radiological characterisation. With the term “radiological characterisation” we define all operation to determinate the type, location and concentration of radionuclides. Radiological characterisation, together with clearance levels, allows minimizing the radiological hazards the waste volume and costs of decommissioning. In these last years many efforts have been carried out to improve the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in particular in the decommissioning field. Sometimes we have to face the characterization of unknown and hazardous environments because of the lack of recorded data, in case of experimental facilities where took place different experiments at the beginning of nuclear industry or simply we have to decommissioning facility that was not designed with the aim of future decommissioning (presence of activated material,place difficult to reach or waste disposed without characterization or engineering barriers).

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{is one of}} {{the most}} polluting {{components}} in the exhaust gases of a diesel engines. Therefore, knowledge of the time and place where it is produced during the combustion process is of interest to find a way to reduce diesel engine emissions. Non-intrusive optical diagnostics, based on Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF), are used to study the NO content and distribution within the combustion chamber of a one-cylinder, two-stroke, direct injection diesel engine. The engine has been made optically accessible by mounting quartz windows in the cylinder wall as well as centrally in the cylinder head. It is operated steadily running on standard commercial diesel fuel. A tuneable ArF excimer laser beam is used to excite the NO molecules in the D(v'= 0) -X(v''= 1) band at 193 nm. The ensuing fluorescence is either dispersed in its different wavelength components in an Optical <b>Multichannel</b> <b>Analyser</b> (OMA) or imaged by a gated CCD camera through a narrow-band transmission filter. One of the goals of our present research is to quantify the LIF data as much as possible. Although the NO fluorescence is proportional to the NO density, the proportionality constant depends on the local circumstances at a specific position. Therefore, in order to compare the fluorescence yields throughout the combustion process, they have to be interpreted as an in-cylinder NO density taking into account the changes in laser intensity, pressure and temperature during the stroke. Evaluation of the data results in the conclusion that, in this engine, the bulk of NO formation takes place relatively late in the stroke, indicating that the premixed combustion and the early mixing-controlled combustion contribute only little. Towards larger crank angles the NO content decreases, possibly as a result of oxidation to NO_ 2 in the colder part of the stroke...|$|R

The investigation was initiated by determining the impurity composition of the plasma through spectral surveys utilising both photographic and multi-channel techniques. The principal low Z impurities {{were found to be}} carbon and oxygen while the principal high Z impurity was iron with smaller amounts of chromium and nickel. The investigation was extended using quantitative techniques in the Extreme Vacuum Ultraviolet (EVUV), Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) and Ultraviolet(UV) /visible regions of the spectrum. A novel technique involving a scintillator imaged on to an Optical <b>Multichannel</b> <b>Analyser</b> (OMA) was used for quantitative work in the VUV region and a unique scanning toroidal mirror system was also developed for this range. It was found that the impurity concentration was {{a small fraction of the}} electron density (5 % 0, - 1 % C, - 0. 2 % Fe) and, in conjunction with the bolometric results from other workers, it was found that the impurity radiation was a small fraction (- 4 %) of the global input power (for I/N > 7 x 10 - 14 A. m) and did not lead to radiative cooling at any position in the discharge. The value of the resistivity calculated from the impurity composition was significantly less than the value obtained from helicity balance calculations, assuming a perfect boundary. The impurity diffusion coefficient for carbon was determined using a unique technique based on spatial measurements of CV emission. The measured value of 100 - 150 m 2. s- 1 was anomalously high compared to neoclassical predictions. It was not possible to determine the diffusion mechanisms of either the bulk plasma or the impurities, hence this measurement represents the first step in a more detailed investigation of RFP impurity dynamics. <p...|$|R
