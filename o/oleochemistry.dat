This chapter reviews the role of catalysis and catalyst development in the production of isostearic acid, as an example of recent research in <b>oleochemistry.</b> Starting with a brief history of the oleochemical industry, we trace the development of isostearic acid and other branched fatty acids. The special properties of isostearic acid are illustrated through its use in applications inaccessible to standard fatty acids.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades the <b>oleochemistry</b> has {{gradually}} flooded our everyday life through a mass of products and applications. This is mainly due to the wide structural diversity and reactivity of fatty acids and the growing demand for bio-sourced goods. Today, almost {{one quarter of the}} global vegetable oil production is dedicated to non- food applications, the contribution of animal fats being much more modest. Excepted biodiesels, the chemical applications of tropical edible oils depend on their fatty acids composition: lauric oils (coconut and palm kernel) and palm stearin will be mostly converted into surface actives ingredients while unsaturated oils rather will be subjected to double bond functionalization or cracking. Alongside of major vegetable oils only a few non-edible tropical oils are exclusively intended to <b>oleochemistry</b> such as Castor and Jatropha. Some other non-food oilseed crops (Cuphea, Lesquerella, Vernonia, black mustard [...] .) are promising but further researches are still needed for their development in Southern Countries. In the future, the production increase of major vegetable oils and the development of new ones will face many challenges relating to environmental issues, competition between food and non-food uses and between non-food applications themselves.

Nowadays, Brazil produces 38.2 million tons of sugar (saccharose), 23.2 thousand m 3 of ethanol (anhydrous and hydrated) [16], and 7.1 million tons of soybean oil [23]. Part of this production is used in the chemical industry to obtain fine chemicals, polymers, and specialties [47],[48].

40|$|International audienceBio-acrylic acid (AA) is {{produced}} from glycerol, {{a by-product of}} biodiesel production and <b>oleochemistry.</b> However, conventional purification techniques cannot purify this biobased AA owing to its impurity profile and the significant content of propionic acid (PA).

Thus, a new falling film melt crystallization device has been developed and tested in which: – supercooling {{is limited by the}} use of a crystallization surface made of 316 L stainless steel, – melt is thermostated, – visual observation of the crystal layer is possible, and – morphology of the crystal layer limits the retention of impure liquid.

40|$|In {{this study}} two major {{strategy}} of {{transformation of the}} vegetables substrate are exposed.

The system glycerol/glycerol carbonate constitutes a reactional medium of synthon generation and chemical compounds with skelton of multipurpose glycerylic. Glycerol carbonate is a molecule of first generation of the glycerol, it is conceived in natural media as a new chemistry which makes it possible to reinject glycerol in existing or new industry from the orginal procedure by the way of chemical means. 				The second approach regards the oleaginous seeds, as substrate in vitro or as microreactor in vivo. This marks a technological breakage compared to the model and tradional process of prapartion of oleochemical bases. In this matter it seems possible to obtain the fatty acids, fatty esters, directly from the oleaginous seeds by interaction between lipids and functional enzymes.

40|$|Abstract Background Wax esters are industrially {{relevant}} molecules exploited in several applications of <b>oleochemistry</b> and food industry. At the moment, the production processes mostly rely on chemical synthesis from rather expensive starting materials, and therefore solutions are sought from biotechnology. Bacterial wax esters are attractive alternatives, {{and especially the}} wax ester metabolism of Acinetobacter sp. has been extensively studied. However, the lack of suitable tools for rapid and simple monitoring of wax ester metabolism in vivo has partly restricted the screening and analyses of potential hosts and optimal conditions. Results Based on sensitive and specific detection of intracellular long-chain aldehydes, specific intermediates of wax ester synthesis, bacterial luciferase (LuxAB) was exploited in studying the wax ester metabolism in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1. Luminescence was detected in the cultivation of the strain producing wax esters, and the changes in signal levels could be linked to corresponding cell growth and wax ester synthesis phases. Conclusions The monitoring system showed correlation between wax ester synthesis pattern and luminescent signal. The system shows potential for real-time screening purposes and studies on bacterial wax esters, revealing new aspects to dynamics and role of wax ester metabolism in bacteria. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{shows how}} Tailing film melt {{crystallization}} {{process can be}} intensified by using micro/milli-structured surfaces. This work takes part {{in the development of}} purification techniques of bio-acrylic acid. The current acrylic acid synthesis is based on propylene, a petroleum derivative. Thus, a new production route of a bio-acrylic acid is developed, based on glycerol, a green by-product of <b>oleochemistry</b> and biofuel industry. However, the impurity profile of this bio-AA differs from that of propylene-based: crude bio-AA contains much more propionic acid (PA). Classical purification techniques do not allow the separation of these two chemicals whose structures are similar. [1] showed that falling film melt crystallization halves propionic acid contents in purified AA with yields reaching 60 % and purification time less than five hours. Increasing the exchange surface between the cold surface and the melt to purify can improve heat transfer, decrease purification time and intensify melt crystallization process. Thus, micro/milli-struttured crystallization surfaces have been designed and tested. Results show that these innovative surfaces can increase productivity by 84 %. Heat transfer has been modeled during the crystallization process, and it clearly appears that thermal gradient is divided by ten with milli-structured surface compared to smooth surface...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oleochemistry</b> (i. e., use of {{renewable}} fatty acids, fatty esters, and glycerol from oil crops {{as raw materials}} and platform chemicals) will {{play a significant role}} as one of the unit operations within the integrated biorefinery. However, R&D effort within DOE has traditionally focused only on a single product of this unit operation, biodiesel, because of its potential as a new renewable fuel. Accordingly, DOE commissioned this evaluation of the broader potential of these oleochemical building blocks and their derived products (including biodiesel) to identify: 1) barriers that prevent greater use of oleochemicals within the biorefinery; 2) general technology areas that, with DOE R&D support, would address these barriers, and 3) products that could be addressed by this R&D effort. Important barriers within the biorefinery are immediately suggested by questions such as: • Why are there so few methods for the conversion of oleochemicals into new products? • Why isn’t catalysis used effectively within the biorefinery? • How does one identify the most appropriate market segments to target with oleochemicals?

40|$|Acyl-acyl {{carrier protein}} (ACP) thioesterases are enzymes that {{terminate}} the intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis in plants by hydrolyzing the acyl-ACP intermediates and releasing {{free fatty acids}} to be incorporated into glycerolipids. These enzymes are classified in two families, FatA and FatB, which differ in amino acid sequence and substrate specificity. In the present work, both FatA and FatB thioesterases were cloned, sequenced and characterized from castor (Ricinus communis) seeds, a crop of high interest in <b>oleochemistry.</b> Single copies of FatA and FatB were found in castor resulting to be closely related with those of Jatropha curcas. The corresponding mature proteins were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli for biochemical characterization after purification, resulting in high catalytic efficiency of RcFatA on oleoyl-ACP and palmitoleoyl-ACP and high efficiencies of RcFatB for oleoyl-ACP and palmitoyl-ACP. The expression profile of these genes displayed the highest levels in expanding tissues that typically are very active in lipid biosynthesis such as developing seed endosperm and young expanding leaves.

40|$|Abstract: Vegetable {{oils and}} fats are {{important}} constituents of human and animal foodstuffs. Certain grades are industrially used and, together with carbohydrates and proteins, are important renewable resources compared to fossil and mineral raw materials, whose occurrence is finite. In concepts for new products, the price, performance, and product safety criteria are equally important and have a correspondingly high importance right {{at the start of}} product development. To ensure a high degree of product safety for consumers and the environment, renewable resources have often been shown to have advantages when compared with petrochemical raw materials and can therefore be regarded as being the ideal raw material basis. Results from <b>oleochemistry</b> show that the use of vegetable fats and oils allows the development of competitive, powerful products, which are both consumer-friendly and environment-friendly. Recently developed products, which fit this requirement profile, are the anionic surfactants cocomonoglyceride sulfate and the nonionic sugar surfactant alkyl polyglycoside. These products are used especially as mild surfactants in cosmetic formulations. In polymer applications derivatives of {{oils and fats}}, such as epoxides, polyols, and dimerizations products based on unsaturated fatty acids, are used as plastic additives or components fo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCommercial {{relevance}} of glycerol as a biosourced safe organic building block for valuable commodity chemicals has increased considerably {{with the rapid}} development of <b>oleochemistry.</b> Among the various reaction pathways for catalytic conversion of glycerol, oligomerization to polyglycerols (PGs) {{is one of the}} viable and demanding processes due to the wide field of applications of PGs in cosmetics, polymers, food-additives, antifogging film industry, pharmaceuticals, biomedicals and drug delivery systems. This short review is dedicated to the selective synthesis of polyglycerols preferentially to low molecular-weight oligomers with emphasis on the pros/cons of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous acidic and basic catalytic processes. In addition, recent advances conducted in our laboratory will be given for a selective glycerol oligomerization in the presence of powdered and shaped alkaline earth-based mesoporous catalysts and of hydrothermally synthesized layered structured materials as newly developed basic catalysts. Some critical issues and challenges regarding the rational design of solid catalysts with emphasis on their stability in hot glycerol as well as alternative reaction engineering to overcome the drawbacks stemming from batch reactions will be addressed.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{concepts}} for new products, performance, product safety, and product economy criteria are equally important. They {{are taken into}} account already when the raw materials base for a new industrial product development is defined. Here, renewable resources gain-again after the earlier “green trend” in the 1980 s—increasing attention as an alternative raw materials source compared to fossil feedstock. The industrial use of carbohydrates, proteins, and plant oils aligns perfectly with the principles of Responsible Care and {{is an important part of}} green chemistry and sustainability in general. Since the 1950 s, <b>oleochemistry</b> has grown to a major research and technology area in several institutions and industries. A large variety of products based on fats and oils have been developed since then for different uses, such as specialties for polymer applications, biodiesel, surfactants, emollients for home and personal-care industries, pesticides and biodegradable mineral oil replacements for lubricants. However, at present it seems that the use of renewable resources, especially plant oils, has to compete more and more with the increasing demand for bioenergy, which could cause an unbalanced supply and demand in the future or even a threat for the increasing demand for food in certain areas of the world...|$|E
40|$|Because lipids are hydrophobic, the {{development}} of efficient bioconversions in aqueous media free of organic solvents is particularly challenging for green <b>oleochemistry.</b> Within this aim, enzymes exhibiting various abilities to catalyze acyltransfer reaction in water/lipid systems have been identified. Among these, CpLIP 2 from Candida parapsilosis has been characterized as a lipase/acyltransferase, able to catalyze acyltransfer reactions preferentially to hydrolysis {{in the presence of}} particularly low acyl acceptor concentration and high thermodynamic activity of water (aw > 0. 9). Lipase/acyltransferases are thus of great interest, being able to produce new esters at concentrations above the thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrolysis/esterification with limited to no release of free fatty acids. Here, we present a 3 D model of CpLIP 2 based on homologies with crystallographic structures of Pseudozyma antarctica lipase A. Indeed, the two enzymes have 31 % of identity in their primary sequence, yielding a same general structure, but different catalytic properties. The quality of the calculated CpLIP 2 model was confirmed by several methods. Limited proteolysis confirmed the location of some loops at the surface of the protein 3 D model. Directed mutagenesis also supported the structural model constructed on CAL-A template: the functional properties of various mutants were consistent with their structure-based putative involvement in the oxyanion hole, substrate specificity, acyltransfer or hydrolysis catalysis and structural stability. The CpLIP 2 3 D model, in comparison with CAL-A 3 D structure, brings insights for the elucidation and improvement of the structural determinants involved in the exceptional acyltransferase properties of this promising biocatalyst and of homologous enzymes of the same family...|$|E
40|$|Whereas most {{products}} of the chemical industry are based on petrochemical feedstocks, considerable efforts have been made {{during the past few}} decades to use renewable resources as industrial raw materials. Besides polysaccharides and sugars, plant oils and animal fats {{play an important role in}} such programmes because of their ready availability (present production is > 100 million t/a, which could be increased on demand) of which the lion’s share is used for nutrition (~ 85 million t/a), whereas ~ 15 – 20 million t/a are used for the synthesis of polymers, surfactants, emollients, lubricants, bio-diesel, emulsifiers, etc.). From a chemical point of view, most natural triglycerides offer just two reactive sites, the ester group and the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids. In fact, the chemistry of fats and oils is largely focused on the ester group which can be hydrolyzed or catalytically reduced, leading to glycerol and fatty acids or fatty alcohols, respectively. Reactions involving the alkyl chain or double bonds of triglycerides, fatty acids, fatty alcohols or their derivatives represent far less than 10 % of today’s <b>oleochemistry,</b> with the production of sulfonated fatty alcohols and their derivatives being a major process of this kind. Oxidation reactions at the alkyl or alkenyl chains would be highly desirable as they would lead to oleochemicals with new properties, but the methods available today lack selectivity and require harsh conditions. Notable exceptions are the epoxidation of unsaturated plant oils and the synthesis and use of a few hydroxy fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|As fossil {{resources}} are steadily depleting and environmental concerns have developed {{into one of}} the main discussion points in public and political agendas, sustainability and an ecological viewpoint have become indispensable terms in modern society. This critical pressure towards ‘greener’ alternatives has led to a progressive application of renewable resources by the chemical industry. Vegetable oils present an interesting class of bioresources, with a market comprising both food and non-food applications. Their extraction is a key process as it will exert a strong impact on the resulting oil characteristics and quality. It is most frequently executed through solvent extraction, although mechanical pressing may present an interesting alternative as it represents a generally safer and more sustainable process. Furthermore, oils obtained through pressing are considered to be of superior quality and do not contain any solvent traces. The main drawback to this process involves the extraction yield, which is typically lower than for solvent extraction. Therefore, research has recently focused on continuous oil extraction through extrusion technology and its process optimization in order to increase extraction yields. Single-screw, as well as twin-screw extrusion was employed to efficiently extract vegetable oil from Apiaceae fruits, with Coriandrum sativum L. as a model herb. Coriander vegetable oil is particularly interesting as it has recently been approved as Novel Food Ingredient and is rich in petroselinic acid, allowing applications in <b>oleochemistry.</b> Simultaneously, this allowed coriander fruit biorefinery, as the press cakes may be transformed into agromaterials through thermopressing or be incorporated into a thermoplastic matrix such as PLA for injection molding. This represents a key advancement in the overall process economics and an important waste reduction. The oil extraction efficiency was significantly enhanced through the application of pre-treatments of the fruits prior to the extrusion process. Specifically, the fruit moisture content was shown to exhibit a key impact on their crushing behavior and oil extraction yields. As an example, when mechanical pressing is conducted in a Clextral BC 21 twin-screw extruder, an extraction yield of 68 % is reached, representing a 44 % increase, when the fruit moisture content is reduced from 9. 8 to 0. 3 %, further leading to a significant decrease in the residual oil content of the obtained press cake...|$|E
