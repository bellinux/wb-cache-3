5|$|Seo {{was born}} in Seoul, South Korea. Her mother, aunt, and {{grandmother}} all studied fine arts and she, along with her two <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> brothers, studied piano and took swimming lessons.

5|$|Madonna looks both <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> {{than she}} {{does in the}} photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{was long}} {{generally}} thought that cats were unresponsive to music, {{recent studies have shown}} that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies. Results suggested that cats do benefit from music therapy when the sounds have been composed to target their auditory senses. Other findings include age-related sensitivity (<b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> cats were more responsive than middle aged cats).|$|E
25|$|Girl Guides are {{organised}} into units/troops averaging 15-30 girls under guidance {{of a team}} of leaders. Units subdivide into patrols of about six Guides and engage in outdoor and special interest activities. Units may affiliate with national and international organisations. Some units, especially in Europe, have been co-educational since the 1970s, allowing boys and girls to work together as Scouts. There are other programme sections for <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> girls.|$|E
25|$|Many churches today use {{contemporary}} worship music {{which includes}} a range of styles often influenced by popular music. This often leads to some conflict between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> congregants (see contemporary worship). This is not new; the Christian pop music style {{began in the late}} 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.|$|E

25|$|For {{the circle}} of future editors, this picture was amplified by Anatoly Marchenko's My Testimony, a seminal text which began {{circulating}} in samizdat in December 1967. It provided {{a detailed account of}} his time in labor camps and Soviet prisons (1960-1965), as well as describing the conditions there. Through other contacts and friends, sometimes during prison or camp visits, <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> generations in Moscow began to learn of the repressive measures being used in Ukraine and the Russian provinces.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that has collapsed or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> massive floor {{material of}} volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the younger and older massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it. There are also a few spires of undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.|$|E
25|$|He {{called them}} earlier or later. The three ages became six periods. The British {{seized on the}} concept immediately. Worsaae's earlier and later became Lubbock's palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but {{alternatively}} English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell's 1883 edition of Principles of Geology, with <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> as synonyms. As {{there is no room}} for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which would have resulted in such terms as early early stone age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.|$|E

25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{different}} qualities are detected in first impressions {{may be linked to}} what has been important to survival from an evolutionary perspective. For example, trustworthiness and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated in a study of human faces. People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general, but {{there appears to be a}} difference in first impression judgments between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> adults. Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier, more trustworthy, and less hostile, but more aggressive, than younger adults did of the same photos. Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed, causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do.|$|E
25|$|Audrey Hepburn's legacy {{has endured}} long after her death. The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time. She {{is one of}} few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In her last years, she {{remained}} a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991 and was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992. She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards. She {{has been the subject}} of many biographies since her death including the 2000 dramatisation of her life titled The Audrey Hepburn Story which starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and Emmy Rossum as the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> Hepburn respectively. In January 2009, Hepburn was named on The Times’ list of the top 10 British actresses of all time.|$|E
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. When they asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little upset, if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E

25|$|The {{oldest of}} these assemblages {{is from the}} Yellow Cat, Poison Strip and basal Ruby Ranch members. The small, Ornitholestes-like {{theropod}} Nedcolbertia and the brachiosaurid sauropod Cedarosaurus may be considered as relics, with their closest relatives in the Morrison Formation. In contrast, the polacanthid ankylosaur Gastonia and a yet unnamed iguanodontid are similar to related forms from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. These dinosaurs show that the connection between North America and Europe still existed during the Barremian. All of this changes, however, with the upper dinosaur assemblage {{from the top of}} the Ruby Ranch and Mussentuchit members. This upper assemblage shows greater similarities with Asian dinosaur assemblages from the same time. For example, the primitive ankylosaurid Cedarpelta is related to Gobisaurus and Shamosaurus from Mongolia, but is more primitive than either because it has teeth in the premaxilla. The upper assemblage also has a tyrannosaurid, a ceratopsian, and a pachycephalosaur. Although not a dinosaur, the primitive mammal Gobiconodon is known from both Mongolia and the Mussentuchit Member. Evidence for a middle dinosaur assemblage between the <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>younger</b> ones is controversial because the evidence mostly depends on a single specimen of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus from high in the Ruby Ranch Member and the sauropod Astrodon from low in the Ruby Ranch. Regardless, the upper and lower dinosaur assemblages in the Cedar Mountain Formation document the separation of North America and Europe, the westward drift of North America, and its connection with Asia 10 to 15 million years later.|$|E
