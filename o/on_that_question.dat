5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E

Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that was the last time I ever stole." ...|$|E

It received critical acclaim from music critics, but was a commercial disappointment, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling less than all of his previous three studio albums. Ne-Yo stated: [...] "The album is based upon this short story which basically follows these three characters who are {{forced to choose between}} money-power-and-fame versus love. Which in turn is why I've called it 'Libra Scale'. You know, its whole concept is based <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> of morality – that, if you weighed it all out on a libra scale, which one of those two options would you choose?". Libra Scale sold 112,000 copies in its first week. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, while debuting at number one on the UK R Chart.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802 {{provided}} that the circuit courts could certify questions of law to the Supreme Court if the judges were divided <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Several scholars have argued that certificates of division were pro forma, and that the judge and justice would merely agree to disagree, often without writing opposing opinions. For example, with the circuit court decision leading up to United States v. Marchant (1827), the reporter records that [...] "he district judge concurred in this opinion; but {{as it was a}} matter of not infrequent occurrence, and important to the practice of the court, the judges afterwards divided in opinion for the purpose of obtaining a solemn decision of the superior court." [...] Similarly, the United States v. Ortega (1826) circuit court opinion notes that the [...] "point was taken to the supreme court upon a proforma certificate of a division of opinion in this court." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus the {{question}} of compulsory education is settled so far as Nature is concerned. Her bill <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> was framed and passed long ago. But, like all compulsory legislation, that of Nature is harsh and wasteful in its operation.

6000|$|In 1784, {{three years}} before the Constitution, the United States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and no other, the Congress of the Confederation had before them the {{question}} of prohibiting slavery in that Territory; and four of the [...] "thirty-nine" [...] who afterward framed the Constitution were in that Congress, and voted <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Of these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. The other of the four--James McHenry--voted against the prohibition, showing that for some cause he thought it improper to vote for it.|$|E

Mr. Garth told me what happened on the night of Featherstone's death--how you refused to burn the will; and he said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand pounds.

60|$|<b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> however, Elma {{herself had}} a voice as well. Man proposes; woman decides. And though Elma for her part had quite equally {{made up her mind}} never to marry Cyril, with that nameless terror of {{expected}} madness hanging ever over her head, she felt, on the other hand, her very loyalty to Cyril and to Cyril's brother imperatively demanded that she should still see him often, and display marked friendship towards him as openly as possible. She wanted the world to see plainly for itself that so far as this matter of Guy's reputation was concerned, if Cyril, for his part, wanted to marry her, she, on her side, would be quite ready to marry Cyril.|$|E
60|$|And {{now let me}} say a {{few words}} in regard to Douglas's great hobby of negro equality. He thinks--he says at least--that the Republican party is in favor of {{allowing}} whites and blacks to intermarry, and that a man can't be a good Republican unless he is willing to elevate black men to office and to associate with them on terms of perfect equality. He knows that we advocate no such doctrines as these, but he cares not how much he misrepresents us if he can gain a few votes by so doing. To show you what my opinion of negro equality was in times past, and to prove to you that I stand <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> where I always stood, I will read you a few extracts from a speech that was made by me in Peoria in 1854. It was made in reply to one of Judge Douglas's speeches.|$|E

60|$|Helstone and Moore {{being both}} in {{excellent}} spirits, and united {{for the present}} in one cause, you would expect that, as they rode side by side, they would converse amicably. Oh no! These two men, of hard, bilious natures both, rarely came into contact but they chafed each other's moods. Their frequent bone of contention was the war. Helstone was a high Tory (there were Tories in those days), and Moore was a bitter Whig--a Whig, at least, as far as opposition to the war-party was concerned, that being the question which affected his own interest; and only <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> did he profess any British politics at all. He liked to infuriate Helstone by declaring {{his belief in the}} invincibility of Bonaparte, by taunting England and Europe with the impotence of their efforts to withstand him, and by coolly advancing the opinion that it was as well to yield to him soon as late, since he must in the end crush every antagonist, and reign supreme.|$|E
60|$|Upon the {{presentation}} of the record in this case and the examination thereof, aided by the report thereon of the Judge-Advocate-General, and on full hearing of counsel for the accused, being specified that no proper question remained open except as to the sanity of the accused, I caused a very full examination to be made <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> upon a great amount of evidence, including all effort by the counsel for accused, by an expert of high reputation in that professional department, who thereon reports to me, as his opinion, that the accused, Dr. David M. Wright, was not insane prior to or on the 11th day of July, 1863, the date of the homicide of Lieutenant Sanborn; that he has not been insane since, and is not insane now (Oct. 7, 1863).
