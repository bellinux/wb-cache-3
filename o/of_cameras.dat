Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Nine B.2 {{aircraft}} {{were converted}} for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants {{which had been}} withdrawn due to wing fatigue, with delivery beginning in July 1965. These aircraft received a variety <b>of</b> <b>cameras,</b> a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and wing top sniffers to detect particles released from nuclear testing. Designated Victor SR.2, a single aircraft could photograph {{the whole of the}} United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie. Different camera configurations could be installed in the bomb bay, including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography; nighttime photography required the fitting of F89 cameras.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him and scatter his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{factors contributing}} to the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> operators in urban camera surveillance. The use <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> surveillance has taken an enormous flight in the past decades. Despite this increase, its effectiveness is strongly debated. One reason for the disputed effectiveness may be that {{an understanding of how}} to use camera surveillance, including elements contributing to the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> operators, has not kept track with technological developments. This paper focuses on the role of expertise and familiarity with the environment on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> operators to detect offenders in video footage from Rotterdam City Surveillance in the Netherlands. Results show no effect of expertise, but do show that familiarity with the location contributes to operator effectiveness and that camera operators seem to use different criteria for detecting and selecting suspects depending on the familiarity with the location. These results contribute to our understanding of operator effectiveness and offer guidelines for the training <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> operators. Implications are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} the task <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> calibration have relied {{on the use of}} accurate grid patterns, or strategically placed targets. Such approaches can prove time consuming and often require expert supervision. For ambient intelligence type applications, it is unwise to rely on the consistency <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> positions and orientations; consequently a fully autonomous camera calibration procedure is preferred. In this paper we present an auto-calibration system for the estimation of the extrinsic properties <b>of</b> active <b>cameras</b> lying within indoor, self-observable groups. Neither prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> locations, nor a calibration-pattern is required, just a few basic parameters concerning the physical appearance <b>of</b> the <b>cameras.</b> Groups <b>of</b> active <b>cameras</b> can be calibrated within minutes, by exploiting their precise control mechanisms. As no supervision is required, camera deployment configurations can be changed or new cameras added easily. 1...|$|R

His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a relatable everyman, and protect him from the outside world with a sense of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, a system <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of}} the earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful <b>of</b> <b>cameras</b> were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
50|$|The S95 is {{the first}} compact camera to feature Hybrid IS, which {{minimizes}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> shake on image quality. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> shake: angular shake and lateral shake. The PowerShot S95’s Hybrid IS stabilizes both types <b>of</b> <b>camera</b> shake by using a dedicated acceleration sensor to detect lateral shake. Because Hybrid IS is effective in reducing noticeable lateral shake at short shooting distances (where shooting magnification is high), the camera is able to greatly stabilize images at all shooting distances.|$|R
