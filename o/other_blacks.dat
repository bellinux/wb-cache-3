Harding's campaign manager rejected the accusations. Wooster College professor William Estabrook Chancellor publicized the rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.|$|E
25|$|Another black American entrepreneur, J.B. Stradford, {{arrived in}} Tulsa in 1899. He {{believed}} {{that black people}} had {{a better chance of}} economic progress if they pooled their resources, worked together and supported each other's businesses. He bought large tracts of real estate in the northeastern part of Tulsa, which he had subdivided and sold exclusively to <b>other</b> <b>blacks.</b> Gurley and a number of <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> soon followed suit. Stradford later built the Stradford Hotel on Greenwood, where blacks could enjoy the amenities of the downtown hotels who served only whites. It was said to be the largest black-owned hotel in the United States.|$|E

25|$|As {{official}} cricket clubs {{began to}} form, some black players {{were given the}} opportunity to play for white-majority clubs. However, many cricket clubs remained exclusively white, forcing black players to establish their own clubs that would only allow <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> to join. Clubs such as the Barbados Cricket Committee (BCC), which was established in the late nineteenth century, adhered to the policy of an all-white team, while Jamaica's Melbourne Cricket Club was composed of only coloured professionals.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Barry Goldwater's {{platform}} galvanized South Carolina's conservative Democrats and led {{to major}} defections of whites into the Republican Party, led by Senator Strom Thurmond. With the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the national government under the Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson worked to enforce rights for South Carolina and <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> to participate in public life and regain the power of suffrage. Since then African Americans have been regularly elected to national, state and local offices in the state.|$|E
25|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of slaves escaped {{during the war and}} joined British lines; others simply moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war. This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists. Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks {{at the end of the}} war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> were sold in the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Roosevelt {{established}} the Fair Employment Practices Committee to implement Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors.

African Americans who gained defense industry jobs in the 1940s shared in the higher wages; in the 1950s they had gained in relative economic position, about 14% higher than <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> who were not in such industries. Their moves into manufacturing positions were critical to their success. The issue of desegregating the armed forces did not arise, but in 1940 Roosevelt appointed former federal judge William H. Hastie, an African American, to be a civilian aide to Secretary of War Henry Stimson.|$|E

25|$|Moore v. Dempsey was {{the first}} case to come before the court in the 20th century related to the {{treatment}} of African Americans in the criminal justice systems of the South, where they lived in a segregated society that had disenfranchised them. The case resulted from prosecution of twelve men for the death of a white man associated with the Elaine Race Riot in Phillips County, Arkansas. A white railroad security employee died on September 30, 1919 after shots were exchanged outside a church where a black tenant farmers union was meeting. With rumors of black insurrection, Governor Charles Hillman Brough led a deployment of federal troops into the rural county, arresting hundreds of blacks. <b>Other</b> <b>blacks</b> were allowed to be in public only with military passes. In the week after the shooting, roving bands of whites and federal troops killed upwards of 200 blacks.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses the}} vernacular of African Americans, irony, understatement, and humor {{to make her}} {{statements}} about race and racism in America. [...] She acts as a spokesperson for her race in these poems, in which her use of irony and humor allows her {{to speak for the}} collective and to assume a distance in order to make comments about her themes, topics, and subjects. [...] Critic Kathy M. Essick have called the poems in Diiie [...] "protest poems". [...] The metaphors in her poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for meanings understood by <b>other</b> <b>Blacks,</b> although her themes and topics are universal for most readers to understand.|$|E
500|$|In {{her third}} autobiography, Angelou {{is placed in}} {{circumstances}} that force her to change her opinions about whites, not an easy change for her. Louise Cox, the co-owner of the record store she frequents on Fillmore Street, generously offers Angelou employment and friendship. Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. This is a difficult decision for Angelou, and she must justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white. She was not marrying [...] "one of the enemy", {{but she could not}} escape the embarrassment and shame when they encountered <b>other</b> <b>Blacks.</b> Later, she has a friendship among equals with her white co-workers, Jorie, Don, and Barrie, who assist her job quest at The Purple Onion. Cudjoe insists, [...] "This free and equal relationship is significant to her in that it represents an important stage of her evolution toward adulthood".|$|E

500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by <b>other</b> <b>Blacks.</b> [...] In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show", for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. [...] Sylvester states that this is true in much of Angelou's poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. [...] Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in which understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. [...] Hagen connects this poem with the final scene in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, which describes her encounter with her friend, a drug addict who shows her the effects of his drug habit. [...] According to Hagen, the poem is full of disturbing images, such as drugs being a slave master and the junkie being tied to his habit like a monkey attached to the street vendor's strap.|$|E
500|$|Angelou explores many of {{the same}} themes {{throughout}} all her writings, in both her autobiographies and poetry. [...] These themes include love, painful loss, music, discrimination and racism, and struggle. Her poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques. [...] It has been compared with music and musical forms, especially the blues, and like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. [...] Many of her poems are about love, relationships, or overcoming hardships, as expressed in poems of hers such as [...] "Still I Rise", I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, and Million Man March Poem. [...] The metaphors in her poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for meanings understood by <b>other</b> <b>Blacks,</b> but her themes and topics apply universally to all races. [...] Angelou uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. [...] As she does throughout her autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, but for her entire gender and race. Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. [...] Tied with Angelou's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the {{popularity}} of Jamaica's reggae music and musician Bob Marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally. The anti-establishment philosophy of Rastafari, echoed {{in much of the}} reggae of the time, resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among African Americans and <b>other</b> <b>Blacks,</b> but among counterculture whites as well. Eastern Christians are encouraged [...] to wear long hair with long beard. In the 1980s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or counter-cultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as Rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged then-contemporary views of tradition. In the 2000s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts; for example, musicians in Metal bands and their fans often wear long hair. Long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization, such as Locks of Love, for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise, such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate. Today long hair has gained even more popularity. Even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back. This could in part be due to the [...] "man bun" [...] trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer hair back into a topknot Bun (hairstyle).|$|E

500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by <b>other</b> <b>Blacks.</b> In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show" [...] in Diiie, for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E
2500|$|Most [...] {{members of}} both the planter/business class and common farmer class of the South opposed black power, carpetbaggers and {{military}} rule, and sought white supremacy. Democrats nominated blacks for political office and tried to steal <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> from the Republican side. When these attempts to combine with the blacks failed, the planters joined the common farmers in simply trying to displace the Republican governments. The planters and their business allies dominated the self-styled [...] "conservative" [...] coalition that finally took control in the South. They were paternalistic toward the blacks but feared they would use power to raise taxes and slow business development.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, FBI {{officials}} {{became increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or [...] "fellow travelers." [...] In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T.R.M. Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee, Emmett Till, and <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> in the South. The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO, a portmanteau derived from [...] "COunter-INTELligence PROgram." [...] It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non-violent organizations. Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the Rev.
