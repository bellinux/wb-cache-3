5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be less than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to the greatest common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E
5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is greater than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to F'N+1 which in turn is greater than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E

5|$|French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi {{turned out to}} be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases.

A body mass index greater than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E

5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Mu in 1756, however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by Francis Baily, before being named N Scorpii by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who felt its brightness warranted recognition. Though Beta Normae was depicted on his star chart, it was inadvertently {{left out of}} Lacaille's 1763 catalogue, was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named H Scorpii by Gould. Norma's brightest star, Gamma2 Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Overall, there are 44 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to apparent magnitude 6.5.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave Bayer designations to ten stars now named Alpha to Lambda Pyxidis, {{skipping}} the Greek letters iota and kappa. Although a nautical element, {{the constellation}} {{was not an}} integral part of the old Argo Navis and hence did not share in the original Bayer designations of that constellation, which were split between Carina, Vela and Puppis. Pyxis is a faint constellation, its three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—form a rough line. Overall, there are 41 stars within the constellation's borders with apparent magnitudes brighter than <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to 6.5.|$|E

5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory.

One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, greater than, <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to another number.|$|E
