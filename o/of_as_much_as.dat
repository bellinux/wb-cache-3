Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506yards (239passing, 267rushing). Young also became one of only sevenplayers in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200yards rushing and 200yards passing in a singlegame. Over the past threemeetings between the twoschools (2003–2005), the Longhorns outscored the Cowboys by a combined second-half score of 118–0.|$|E

As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons).

5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust. Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars {{have been found to}} clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E

5|$|Fantasia grossed over $300,000 in {{the first}} sixteen weeks in New York; over $20,000 in the opening five weeks in San Francisco; and almost the same amount {{in the first}} ten weeks both in Los Angeles and Boston. The first eleven roadshows earned a total of $1.3 million by April 1941, but the $85,000 in {{production}} and installation costs of a single Fantasound setup, along with theatres having to be leased, forced Disney to exceed their loan limits. The onset of the Second World War prevented plans for a potential release in Europe, normally the source <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> forty-five per cent of the studio's income. Up to eighty-eight engagements were outlined across five years, but wartime demands for material limited the number of Fantasound prints to sixteen. All {{but one of the}} Fantasound setups were dismantled and given to the war effort. Upon acquiring the film's distribution rights in April 1941, RKO initially continued the roadshow booking policy but presented the film in mono, which was easier to exhibit. The combined average receipts from each roadshow was around $325,000, which placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio.|$|E

25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron microprobe has determined that the boulders consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak {{in the interior of}} a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.|$|E
