30|$|The VizAblate System uses an incisionless, {{transcervical}} {{approach to}} treat symptomatic fibroids, {{including those that}} are not generally amenable to alternative intrauterine treatment approaches such as hysteroscopic resection or morcellation. Fibroid ablation takes place under real-time visualization provided by an intrauterine sonography probe that is integrated within the device. This built-in imaging removes the need for the physician to coordinate <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>device</b> and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> monitor. The graphical user interface delineates the boundaries of ablation and thermal spread outside the zone of ablation and enables the operator to avoid thermal injury to the serosa with its potential for adhesiogenesis and injury to adjacent viscera. Intrauterine sonography provides higher-resolution imaging <b>than</b> the <b>more</b> prevalent transvaginal sonography and has greater precision and accuracy for the measurement of fibroids near the endometrial cavity [29]. The use of intrauterine sonography has been demonstrated useful for the imaging of intratubal implants for sterilization after placement [30].|$|R
50|$|In {{split-phase}} wiring, {{for example}} a duplex receptacle in a North American kitchen, devices may {{be connected with}} a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, {{the top and bottom}} hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, {{the other side of the}} duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a multiwire branch circuit. Common trip is required when the connected load uses <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one phase simultaneously. The common trip prevents overloading of the shared neutral if <b>one</b> <b>device</b> draws <b>more</b> <b>than</b> rated current.|$|R
40|$|Combined power {{generation}} or cogeneration {{is a highly}} effective technology that produces heat and electricity in <b>one</b> <b>device</b> <b>more</b> efficiently <b>than</b> separate production. Overall effectiveness is growing by use of combined technologies of energy extraction, taking heat from flue gases and coolants of machines. Another problem is the dependence of such devices on fossil fuels as fuel. For the combustion turbine is mostly used as fuel natural gas, kerosene and as fuel for heating power plants is mostly used coal. It is therefore necessary to seek for compensation today, which confirms the assumption in the future. At first glance, the obvious efforts are to restrict the use of largely oil and change the type of energy used in transport. Another significant change is the increase in renewable energy—energy that is produced from renewable sources. Among machines gaining energy by unconventional way belong mainly the steam engine, Stirling engine, and Ericsson engine. In these machines, the energy is obtained by external combustion and engine performs work in a medium that receives and transmits energy from combustion or flue gases indirectly.

40|$|Abstract. A SOHO (Small Office or Home Office) {{architecture}} can be sketched as {{an architecture}} that involves an ITSP (Internet Telephony Service Provider) and subscribers. The ITSP offers SIP protocol based telephony and presence services for subscribers. A subscriber {{has a single}} billing account but several addresses (also called extensions or numbers). Each of those addresses can be assigned to a device, may it be wired or wireless. The subscriber’s set of addresses can be either owned by a single user or {{by a group of}} users. In the latter case, each user has one or several addresses. The devices that are presence capable, periodically publish the user presence status to the ITSP presence server. The latter then dispatches this information to other users who have requested to watch the status of that user. If the watched user has <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>device,</b> then <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> status are published. The problem that is addressed arises when the different presence status published about the same user are contradictory. The paper defines the problem of presence status interactions as similar to the known problem of Feature Interactions. Then, a multi-agent architecture, a set of presence interaction resolution policies and a communication language are designed in order to elaborate a solution...|$|R

40|$|A {{scientist}} once gave {{a public}} lecture describing how the Earth orbits {{around the sun}} and how the sun, in turn, orbits around {{the center of a}} collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady {{at the back of the}} room got up and said: “What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise. ” The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, “What is the tortoise standing on?” “You’re very clever, young man, very clever, ” said the old lady, “but it’s turtles all the way down!” Current trusted computing technologies allow computing devices to verify each other, but in a networked world, there is no reason to trust <b>one</b> computing <b>device</b> any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> another. Treating these devices as turtles, the user who seeks a trustworthy system from which to verify others quickly realizes that it’s “turtles all the way down” because of the endless loop of trust dependencies. We need to provide the user with one initial turtle (the iTurtle) which is axiomatically trustworthy, thereby breaking the dependency loop. In this paper, we present some of the research challenges involved in designing and using such an iTurtle. ...|$|R
