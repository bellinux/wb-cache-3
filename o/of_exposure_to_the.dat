5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that {{it must have been the}} same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> less-lethal first wave.|$|E

Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{instruments}} {{also experienced}} degradation {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the Rock Abrasion Tool wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets. All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, {{towards the end of}} Spirits life, the MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its cobalt-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.|$|E
25|$|This theory, in {{particular}} when speculating on radiological weapons, is partly {{based on the}} findings of radioactivity on some of the clothing as well as the bodies being described by relatives as having orange skin and grey hair. However, radioactive dispersal would have affected all of the hikers and equipment instead of just some of it, and the skin and hair discolouration can be explained by a natural process of mummification after three months <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cold and winds. Furthermore, the initial suppression of files regarding the group's disappearance by Soviet authorities is sometimes mentioned as evidence of a cover-up, but the concealment of information regarding domestic incidents was standard procedure in the USSR and therefore far from peculiar.

25|$|In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was {{planning}} on stopping funding for the ABCC's work in Japan. However, James V. Neel made an appeal and the AEC decided to fund them $20,000 a year, for three years, to continue research. In 1956, Neel and William J. Schull published their final draft of The Effect <b>of</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This monograph gave {{a detailed description of}} all the data they had collected Despite their efforts, trust in the ABCC was declining, so the ABCC became the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), and with the new name and administrative organization, funding for the research on survivors was to be provided equally by the United States and Japan. The RERF was established on 1 April 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.|$|E
25|$|In {{an angry}} {{response}} to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism {{and a system}} of Commonwealth preference {{during the winter of}} 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> international economy, which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|James Anthony Froude, a {{well-known}} English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule. In 1886, he published Oceana, {{another one of}} Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions {{on the benefits of}} the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would strip away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as bad as it was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals; however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the bicentenary of Berlioz's birth, his {{achievements}} and status {{were much more}} widely recognized, and his music is now viewed as both serious and original, rather than an eccentric novelty. Newspaper articles reported his colourful life with zeal, very many festivals dedicated to the composer were held, readings of his books and a one-hour French television dramatised biography all helped to create a lot <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> composer's life and music– {{far more than the}} previous centenary anniversary. Numerous recording projects were begun or reissued, and broadcasts of his music increased. Prominent Berlioz conductor Colin Davis had already been in the process of recording much of Berlioz's music on the LSO Live label, and has continued this project to this date with a L'enfance du Christ recording issued in 2007. The internet was also a factor in the celebrations, with the comprehensive hberlioz.com site (which has been online since 1997) being an easily available source of information to anyone interested in the composer. The 'Berlioz 2003' celebrations, organised by French academic institutions, also had a prominent website, listing events, publications and gatherings the domain of which has now lapsed. There was also a site maintained by the Association nationale Hector Berlioz. A proposal was made to remove his remains to the Panthéon, and while initially encouraged by French President Jacques Chirac, the proposal was rejected on the basis that Berlioz was an anti-establishment figure and would have no interest in such a ceremony, and that he was happy to be buried next to his two wives in the location he has been in for almost 150 years.|$|E
500|$|Central to the {{promotion}} was the limiting <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album's content, {{as well as}} a focus on face-to-face contact for press previews. As Hahn stated, [...] "There is a minimalism in our approach that creates an absence of information, and we notice our fans tend to throw themselves into the breach, or try to fill the empty spaces." [...] The album's track titles were initially withheld from online retailers and later revealed through Columbia's Vine account on 16 April 2013 as a video relaying a series of images. Following a reported leak of the song days earlier, [...] "Get Lucky" [...] was released as a digital download single on 19 April 2013. On 13 May, Daft Punk's official Vevo channel posted a video revealing the artwork packaging of the vinyl version of the album, as well as the first few seconds of the opening track. Later that day, a limited-time preview stream of the full album was launched via the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Schneider began {{investigating}} asbestos-related {{deaths in}} Libby, Montana, for the P-I. His investigation found asbestos particles {{had been released}} by a closed vermiculite mine, causing contamination of workers' clothing. The mine operator, W.R. Grace and Company, was alleged to have known about the dangers <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> asbestos processed at the Libby mine and failed to disclose the risks to workers and government agencies in a timely manner. The asbestos contamination, according to Schneider, had killed at least 192 people in Libby, including the wives and children of miners, and at least 375 people were diagnosed with potentially fatal diseases associated with asbestos. The release of the story, entitled [...] "Uncivil Action: A Town Left to Die", gained national attention and led to litigation against W.R. Grace and the indictment of executives on federal charges of knowing endangerment, obstruction of justice, and wire fraud after the company declared bankruptcy and illegally transferred funds and assets to new companies. The Environmental Protection Agency launched {{an investigation into the}} Libby mine after the release of the story, and later established a Superfund cleanup site in Libby, declaring in 2009 that the town was under a public health emergency.|$|E

500|$|Hagerstrom, {{determined}} to be an ace in two wars, studied MiG-15 reports, got a silk coat and special glasses {{that allowed him to}} see twice as far as normal, and made his own survival kit. He later transferred to the 334th Fighter Squadron of the Fifth U.S. Air Force's 18th Wing, some members of which (including Hagerstrom) were equipped with North American F-86 Sabres. Hagerstrom got the wing's first kill of the war on November 21, 1952 near the Yalu River. The MiG pilot Hagerstrom was shooting at ejected just before his plane exploded, and a piece of that plane was embedded in Hagerstrom's F-86, proving the kill to Kimpo Air Base group commander Royal N. Baker. On December25, he got his second kill when the MiG he was chasing at an altitude of [...] spun out of control, and the pilot ejected, most likely dying <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] temperatures. In January1953 Hagerstrom was transferred to Osan Air Base to help with the transition from propeller P-38s to jet F-86s, and by mid-February the wing's 125 pilots were trained in the F-86. On February25 he was chasing two MiGs when he noticed a third attacking another F-86; he engaged and shot it down flying very low over Mukden, China. Low on fuel, he had just enough fuel to land and park the aircraft.|$|E
