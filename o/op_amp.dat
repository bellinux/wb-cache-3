25|$|The input {{impedance}} of the simplified non-inverting amplifier is high, of order Rdif × AOL times the closed-loop gain, where Rdif is the op amp's {{input impedance}} to differential signals, and AOL is the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp; {{in the case}} of the ideal <b>op</b> <b>amp,</b> with AOL infinite and Rdif infinite, the input impedance is infinite. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between the impedances driving the V+ and V− <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> inputs.|$|E

25|$|The 30 pF {{capacitor}} stabilizes the amplifier via Miller {{compensation and}} functions {{in a manner}} similar to an op-amp integrator circuit. Also known as 'dominant pole compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the open loop frequency response; in a 741 <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> this pole can be as low as 10Hz (where it causes a −3dB loss of open loop voltage gain).|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{amplifiers}} use {{current or}} voltage as input and output, so {{four types of}} amplifier are possible (any of two possible inputs with any of two possible outputs). See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be {{any one of the}} four types of amplifier and is not necessarily the same type as the open-loop amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types.

25|$|A non-ideal op amp's {{equivalent}} circuit has a finite input impedance, a non-zero output impedance, and a finite gain.

Operational amplifiers are optimised for use with negative feedback, and this article discusses only negative-feedback applications. When positive feedback is required, a comparator is usually more appropriate. See Comparator applications for further information.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{electronic}} analog computers contain {{anywhere from}} a few to a hundred or more operational amplifiers ("op amps"), named because they perform mathematical operations. <b>Op</b> <b>amps</b> are {{a particular type of}} feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.|$|R

2500|$|This {{portion of}} the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an ever-growing demand for {{low-power}} mixed signal integrated circuits for such applications as mobile or wired communications and other portable systems. In these applications, the supply voltage is being scaled down to reduce overall power consumption. As for the fabrication process, digital CMOS is always the preferred technology due to its efficient economic costs. As a result, contemporary analog circuits must not only operate with low supply voltages, but should also be realizable in typical digital CMOS processes. However, this concession leads to significant performance degradation of the analog circuits. Since <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> are the most critical building blocks in all analog systems, {{the objective of this}} report is to study the theory and design of low voltage <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> for digital CMOS processes. Two categories of low voltage <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> have been identified as being suitable for low voltage applications [1]. The first category operates with 2 - 3 V power supplies.

By going to a CCD array operating in a TDI mode, over 700 individual <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> can be replaced with only 48 <b>op</b> <b>amps.</b> Smooth spectral response and 70 % quantum efficiency have been provided by using doped tin oxide gates over the imaging region...|$|R
2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective input offset voltage present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial <b>op</b> <b>amp</b> offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circuit}} {{involving}} Q16 (variously named rubber diode or VBE multiplier), the 4.5k resistor must be conducting about 100μA, with the Q16 VBE roughly 700mV. Then the VCB must be about 0.45V and VCE at about 1.0V. Because the Q16 collector {{is driven by}} a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ≈ 1V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100mV / VT [...] ) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the <b>op</b> <b>amp.</b> This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the crossover distortion of this stage.|$|E

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADCs) {{are widely}} used in communication systems to interface analog and digital circuits. While the speed, power, and area of digital circuits directly benefit from the decreasing channel length of CMOS devices, analog circuits suffer from reduced headroom, lower intrinsic gain, and higher device mismatch. Consequently, it has been increasingly difficult to design high-speed and low-power pipelined ADCs using conventional <b>op</b> <b>amps.</b> This work presents a pipelined ADC that employs novel "charge-steering" <b>op</b> <b>amps</b> to relax the trade-offs among speed, noise, and power consumption.
