5|$|It is not {{surprising}} then that Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) concluded that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|E
5|$|The Brownian motion {{process and}} the Poisson process (in <b>one</b> <b>dimension)</b> are both {{examples}} of Markov processes in continuous time, while random walks on the integers and the gambler's ruin problem are examples of Markov processes in discrete time.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only <b>one</b> <b>dimension,</b> its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} critical number of attractive Bose-Einstein condensed atoms in asymmetric traps was studied. The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) formalism for an atomic system with arbitrary nonspherically symmetric harmonic trap was also discussed. Characteristic limits were obtained for reductions from three to two and <b>one</b> <b>dimensions</b> from three to two and <b>one</b> <b>dimensions,</b> in perfect cylindrical symmetries {{as well as in}} deformed ones...|$|R

5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically in at least <b>one</b> <b>dimension.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort cards {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort cards based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort the cards based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> and can then switch to sorting cards on a second dimension.|$|E
30|$|Remark 1.1. Since the {{continuous}} embedding H 1 (Ω) ↪ L∞(Ω) holds only in <b>one</b> space <b>dimension,</b> {{we can only}} establish the uniform maximum-norm estimates about time for the solution in <b>one</b> space <b>dimension.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, {{the theory}} {{implies that the}} Universe had fewer {{dimensions}} after the Big Bang when its energy was high. Then the number of dimensions may have increased as the system cooled and the Universe may gain more dimensions with time. There could have originally been only <b>one</b> spatial <b>dimension,</b> with two <b>dimensions</b> total — <b>one</b> time <b>dimension</b> and <b>one</b> space <b>dimension.</b> When {{there were only two}} dimensions, the Universe lacked gravitational degrees of freedom.|$|R
50|$|A domain (hyper volume) is {{extended}} in three spatial <b>dimensions</b> and <b>one</b> time <b>dimension.</b> A domain wall is {{the boundary between}} two neighboring domains. Thus a domain wall {{is extended}} in two spatial <b>dimensions</b> and <b>one</b> time <b>dimension.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only <b>one</b> <b>dimension,</b> with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> of time (later/earlier). Thus, {{in the language of}} modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is that it requires extra dimensions of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In superstring theory, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called supersymmetry, there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
40|$|By {{carefully}} {{analyzing the}} geodesic motion {{of a test}} particle in the bulk of brane worlds, we identify an extra force which is recognized in a spacetime of <b>one</b> lower <b>dimension</b> as a nongravitational force acting on the particle. Such extra force acts on the particle {{in such a way}} that the conventional particle mechanics in <b>one</b> lower <b>dimension</b> is violated, thereby hinting at the higher-dimensional origin of embedded spacetime in the brane world scenario. We obtain the explicit equations describing the motion of the bulk test particle as observed in <b>one</b> lower <b>dimension</b> for general gravitating configurations in brane worlds and identify the extra nongravitational force acting on the particle measured in <b>one</b> lower <b>dimension.</b> (24 refs) ...|$|R

By Hurwitz's theorem such algebras only exist in one, two, four, and eight dimensions, so the cross product must be in zero, one, three or seven dimensions. The products in zero and <b>one</b> <b>dimensions</b> are trivial, so non-trivial cross products only exist in three and seven dimensions.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in <b>one</b> <b>dimension</b> sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E
