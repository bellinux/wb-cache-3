Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of <b>Order.</b> <b>With</b> the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E

5|$|All the {{families}} were formerly treated {{as part of}} a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between {{the families}} are however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate <b>order,</b> <b>with</b> the Boreidae, sister to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be sister {{to the rest of the}} Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E

5|$|Drukair {{became the}} launch {{customer}} for the Avro RJX-85 in April 2000 when it placed an <b>order</b> <b>with</b> BAE Systems for two aircraft, with deliveries initially {{scheduled to take}} place in November 2001 and January 2002. Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair to after April 2002. BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002, due to receiving orders from only two airlines, Drukair and British European. With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems, the aircraft manufacturer offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair, although airline management decided against acquiring the aircraft, citing potential problems with sourcing spare parts for the aircraft in future.|$|E

5|$|In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} <b>order</b> <b>with</b> the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships— and Ohioan. The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed {{for some of the}} nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Ohioan, including financing costs, was $73.58 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $730,000.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top <b>order</b> <b>with</b> a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth man before Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership.

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an <b>order</b> <b>with</b> the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—Kentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The {{contract}} for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of Kentuckian, including financing costs, was $58.33 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $579,000.|$|E
5|$|Karthik had a lean Test {{series against}} Pakistan {{at home in}} late 2008. In the first two Tests, he managed only 39 in two innings, passing single figures only once. In the Third Test in Bangalore, Sachin Tendulkar was injured, and his {{replacement}} Yuvraj scored 170. Karthik, batting down the <b>order</b> <b>with</b> Gautam Gambhir taking his opening position, scored 24 and 52 in a high-scoring draw and kept wickets because of Dhoni's absence with injury. In the first innings, Karthik was behind the stumps as India set a world record for the most extras conceded in a Test innings. The 35 byes that were leaked were the second highest amount in Test history. India won the First Test and the other matches were drawn.|$|E
