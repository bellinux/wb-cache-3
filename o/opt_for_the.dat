5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, {{stated that the}} choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E

25|$|These {{gains were}} {{not just a matter}} of renewed access on {{favorable}} terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally lower interest rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to prefinance Spanish dyestuff exports (like they also prefinanced Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).|$|E

25|$|The 1890s {{and early}} 1900s {{were marked by}} {{frequent}} strikes throughout Georgia. The peasants, too, were still discontented, and the Social Democrats won peasants and urban workers over to their cause. At this stage, the Georgian Social Democrats still saw themselves {{as part of an}} all-Russian political movement. However, at the Second Congress of the all-Russian Social Democratic Party held in Belgium in 1903, the party split into two irreconcilable groups: the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. By 1905, the Social Democratic movement in Georgia had overwhelmingly decided in favour of the Mensheviks and their leader Noe Zhordania. One of the few Georgians to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bolshevik faction was the young Ioseb Jughashvili, better known as Joseph Stalin.|$|E
25|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} the 32 {{states in}} the United States that {{sanctions}} the death penalty for certain murders defined as heinous.

Only three people have been executed in Kentucky since the U.S. Supreme Court re-instituted the practice in 1976. The most notable execution in Kentucky was that of Rainey Bethea on August 14, 1936. Bethea was publicly hanged in Owensboro for the rape and murder of Lischia Edwards. Irregularities with the execution led to this becoming the last public execution in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the new {{recording}} sessions saw {{a return to the}} band's roots: the material was once again based around Koppes and Willson-Piper's guitar interplay. Also, for the first time, the band completely produced itself, under Powles' aegis. Originally given the name Bastard Universe, the forthcoming album was re-titled Hologram of Allah after Willson-Piper found the original too negative. Concerns about fundamentalist Muslim reaction to the potentially blasphemous title made the band finally <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> more neutral Hologram of Baal, after the Canaanite god. Released under a new contract with UK independent label Cooking Vinyl, the album was distributed in the U.S. by Thirsty Ear. A limited edition featured a bonus disc with a nearly 80-minute continuous improvised instrumental, which received the original title of the album, Bastard Universe.|$|E

25|$|Gutta likes playing {{aggressive}} badminton {{and has a}} great {{affinity for}} the front court, with her skilled netplay, good anticipation {{and the ability to}} play deceptive strokes at the net. She is considered very dangerous in the front court with her good reading of the game and sharp interceptions. She also has a strong smash from the back court and often makes use of deceptive drops. Gutta is vulnerable in a few areas of her game, most evidently in her movement across the court. She can commit certain unforced errors when forced to move out of her favoured positions. She has also had some fitness issues and injury troubles in her long career. Gutta is also known for being one of the only top doubles player to still use the forehand service, since most other doubles specialists <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> safer backhand serve.

25|$|Sovereigntists are {{moderate}} nationalists who do {{not believe}} Canada to be reformable {{in a way that}} could answer {{what they see as the}} legitimate wish of Quebecers to govern themselves freely. They <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> independence of Quebec; however, at the same time they insist on offering an economic and political partnership to the rest of Canada on the basis of the equality of both nations. The political parties created by the sovereigntists created are the Bloc Québécois and the Parti Québécois, which its members define as a party of social democratic tendency. The Parti Québécois organized a 1980 referendum and a 1995 referendum, each of which could have led to negotiations for independence had it succeeded. The No side prevailed in both, but its margin was very narrow in the second referendum (50.6% No, 49.4% Yes). Sovereigntists find their ideological origins in the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, René Lévesque's short-lived precursor to the Parti Québécois.|$|E

500|$|After Germany had to cede most {{of former}} German New Guinea and Kiautschou/Tsingtao to Japan {{and with an}} intensifying Sino-German cooperation, {{relations}} between Berlin and Tokyo were nearly dead.

In the 1920s–30s, Germany was the destination of choice for Japanese students wanting to study abroad with 80% of the Japanese students going abroad to study doing so at German universities. In the 1920s, both France and Germany kept the franc and the Reichsmark undervalued, making both countries very attractive for Japanese wanting to study abroad, but as German universities were considered to be far better than French universities, Japanese students tended to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> former rather than the latter. Many of the men who emerged as leaders of the Pan-Asia movement in Japan in the 1930s studied at German universities in the 1920s, which led the Japanese historian Hotta Eri to note there was a strong German influence on the discourse of Japanese Pan-Asianism.|$|E
