50|$|Unlike that of {{its sister}} genre, the {{definition}} of hard fantasy is amorphous in practice.

In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence.

25|$|Each logical system {{comes with}} both a {{syntactic}} component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a semantic component, which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially {{in the context of}} first-order logic where Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In <b>other</b> <b>settings,</b> such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.|$|E

25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to <b>other</b> <b>settings</b> (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E

25|$|Most of The Honeymooners {{took place}} in Ralph and Alice Kramden's small sparsely {{furnished}} two-room apartment. <b>Other</b> <b>settings</b> used in the show included the Gotham Bus Company depot, the Raccoon Lodge, a neighborhood pool parlor, a park bench where Ralph and Ed occasionally meet for lunch,and on occasion the Nortons' apartment (always noticeably better-furnished than the Kramdens'). Many episodes began with a shot of Alice in the apartment awaiting Ralph's arrival from work. Most episodes focused on Ralph' and Ed's characters, although Alice played a substantial role. Ed's wife, Trixie, played a smaller role in the series, and did not appear in every episode as did the other three. Each episode presented a self-contained story, which rarely carried over into a subsequent one. The show employed a number of standard sitcom clichés and plots, particularly those of jealousy, get-rich-quick schemes, and comic misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|Colombia {{continues}} to be the world's single largest producer of cocaine and coca leaves. The land area under coca cultivation has decreased from over 140,000 hectares in 2001 due to aerial coca eradication and manual eradication, but there has been an increase in coca cultivation since 2013, with 96,000 hectares under coca cultivation in 2015 according to the latest United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, representing a 39% increase on the previous year. The majority (81%) of coca cultivation is concentrated in three southern departments (Nariño, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquetá) and in Norte de Santander Department, which are also regions with a substantial FARC presence. The UNODC suggests that different negotiations on the issue, in Havana and <b>other</b> <b>settings,</b> are generating incentives for increased coca cultivation because of the perception that the benefits of development projects would mainly be directed at coca cultivators.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. <b>Other</b> <b>settings</b> of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the Cthulhu Mythos. Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp and Carter used geographical place names from Clark Ashton Smith's Hyperborean Cycle.|$|R

In this way, mainstream teachers gained understanding of their pupils' linguistic and cultural competences and their lives outside school. The partnership work began to build a creative and inclusive curriculum in both settings...|$|R
