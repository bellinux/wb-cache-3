If {{the time when the}} older observer did the experiment was t, the time of the modern experiment is t+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost {{all the way back to}} the Big Bang, and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. <b>Our</b> <b>two</b> dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E

The President also said that he support Trump’s policy of “no-interference” on other countries affairs. He added “Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America’s efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world.

[...] Den of Geek listed [...] "Pusher" [...] as their seventh best episode of the series, and called it [...] "a good game of cat and mouse".

Having written it and imagined it in certain ways, I think {{it could have been a}} lot better. Although I thought it was generally well directed, the show felt very 'wide' to me—very loose and lacking some things. A retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly rated the episode a B, praising Mark Sheppard's [...] "sizzling performance", though finding that the [...] "annoying" [...] character of Phoebe Green was a detriment to the episode, who kept [...] "any real sparks from flying". Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode a C, finding it [...] "contrived and unnecessary", and feeling that the relationship between Mulder and Phoebe Green was not believable.

[...] While driving in his car, Rick tells Shane of an incident with a close relative, who was sitting in blizzard-like conditions while listening to a narrative of Lord of the Rings.
