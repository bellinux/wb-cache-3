40|$|AbstractWith recent {{surge in}} fossil fuel prices {{and demand for}} cleaner {{renewable}} energy sources, wind turbines have become an alternative technology for power generation. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted into the atmosphere contribute to the global climate change. This paper investigates {{the design of a}} Savonius type vertical axis wind turbine and its potential to generate power. To enhance the performance of the turbine, a flow restricting cowl is incorporated into the turbine. The airflow behavior of the turbine was investigated both experimentally and computationally. Three different configurations were studied (<b>open</b> <b>position,</b> <b>centred</b> <b>position</b> and a closed position). It is found that a partially cowled turbine in a <b>centred</b> and closed <b>position</b> resulted in a better performance of the turbine than a fully cowled turbine with the same configuration...|$|R
