5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces.

5|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage {{was the first}} major test of the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the Peace of Augsburg, 1555.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Treaty of Lunéville, the Holy Roman Empire {{underwent}} a process of substantial territorial reorganisation known as the German mediatization, under which Erfurt, since the 10th century a subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> and Archbishopric of Mainz, was transferred to the Kingdom of Prussia, to compensate for territories Prussia lost to France on the Left Bank of the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Most {{voters in}} Brazil had a low income.

In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% of the non-slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.|$|E

5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> of Cologne. In {{his later}} years, a nuncio at Cologne took {{responsibilities}} {{for the financial}} administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of Cologne and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E
5|$|By Spring 1588, Gebhard {{had run out}} of options. In 1583, he {{had refused}} the {{settlement}} offered to him after the conferences at Frankfurt and in Westphalia, counting on the support of the other Protestant electors. When their support did not materialize, he pursued diplomatic options with the French, the Dutch, and the English; these also were of limited help. After the destruction of Neuss in 1586, and the loss of the most of southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> in 1587, Rheinberg and its environs were the only territories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electorate</b> he could claim, and much of this slipped from his grasp in 1588. He had exhausted his diplomatic, financial and military possibilities. His health problems (referred to as Gelenkenschmerz, or joint pain) prohibited him from riding, which limited his ability to travel. In the spring of 1588, he relinquished his claim on the Electorate to the protection of Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, and retired to Strassburg. Neuenahr and Schenck continued to fight for him, but the former died in an artillery explosion in 1589, and the latter was killed at Nijmegen that summer. Without them to defend his claim on the Electorate, Rheinberg, Gebhard's last outpost in the northern Electorate, fell to Parma's force in 1589.|$|E

5|$|Ernst {{depended}} on {{his brother and}} the Catholic barons in the Cathedral Chapter to hold the territory he acquired. In 1585, Munster, Paderborn, and Osnabrück succumbed to Ferdinand's energetic pursuit in the eastern regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> and a short time later, Minden. With their help, Ernst could hold Bonn. Support {{from the city of}} Cologne itself was also secure. To oust Gebhard, though, Ernst ultimately had to appeal for aid to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who commanded Spanish forces in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> to encourage them to vote for the party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} months after Gebhard's conversion, two {{competing}} armies rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electoral territory {{in the destruction of}} the so-called Oberstift. Villages, abbeys and convents and several towns, were plundered and burned, by both sides; Linz am Rhein and Ahrweiler avoided destruction by swearing loyalty to Salentin. In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at Vest in Vest Recklinghausen, a fief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electorate,</b> and then in the Duchy of Westphalia, at Arensberg castle. In both territories, Gebhard set in motion as much of the Reformation as he could, although his soldiers indulged in a bout of iconoclasm and plundering.|$|E
50|$|A summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borough <b>electorate</b> was {{included}} in Lewis's Topographical Dictionary <b>of</b> Ireland, 1837. <b>The</b> <b>electorate</b> consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Borough Corporation (the local Council) and <b>the</b> freemen. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classes <b>of</b> electors qualified because of co-option by all or part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing ones, {{so this was a}} constituency with an oligarchic constitution rather than a democratic one.|$|R
50|$|Hastings and Macleay was {{an electoral}} {{district}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Assembly in <b>the</b> Australian state <b>of</b> New South Wales from 1894 to 1920.
