500|$|In March 1904 {{a three-day}} festival of Elgar's works was {{presented}} at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, [...] "Four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full {{from floor to ceiling}} for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his mind." [...] The king and queen attended the first concert, at which Richter conducted The Dream of Gerontius, and returned the next evening for the second, the London premiere of The Apostles (first heard the previous year at the Birmingham Festival). The final concert of the festival, conducted by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from Caractacus and the complete Sea Pictures (sung by Clara Butt). The orchestral items were Froissart, the Enigma Variations, Cockaigne, the first two (at that time the only two) Pomp and Circumstance marches, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, In the South, inspired by a holiday in Italy.|$|E

5000|$|Evans remarks {{upon the}} song [...] "Why soe pall and wan fond louer" [...] and notes {{that it was}} {{probably}} written and known prior to its appearance in John Suckling's play Aglaura, based on the character Orsames's comments to it: [...] "I little foolish counsel, Madame, I gave / a Friend of mine four <b>or</b> <b>fives</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> / When he was falling into a consumption." [...] Evans notes that the song was easy to perform, {{so that it could}} be sung by regular members of the acting company (rather than a professional singer). [...] L.A. Beaurline states that this setting of [...] "Why So Pale and Wan" [...] is the earliest existing musical setting of this lyric.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] she answered, at length, [...] "I never thought----I {{see what}} you mean. Four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when I was going to socialist lectures, my sense of all this--inequality, {{injustice}} was intellectual.

But, Miss Helen, if Beasley forces the deal there will be serious trouble. I've seen thet happen. Four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> Beasley rode some greasers off their farms an' no one ever knowed {{if he had a}} just claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} {{anything}} of Mrs. Charmond's past history? Perhaps that would throw some light upon things. Before she came here as the wife of old Charmond four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> not a soul seems to have heard aught of her. Why not make inquiries? And then do ye wait and see more; there'll be plenty of opportunity. Time enough to cry when you know 'tis a crying matter; and 'tis bad to meet troubles half-way." ...|$|E

60|$|About {{the year}} 1777, Captain Cook {{estimated}} {{the population of}} Tahiti at about two hundred thousand. By a regular census, taken some four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> it {{was found to be}} only nine thousand. This amazing decrease not only shows the malignancy of the evils necessary to produce it; but, from the fact, the inference unavoidably follows that all the wars, child murders, and other depopulating causes, alleged to have existed in former times, were nothing in comparison to them.|$|E
60|$|Take {{this for}} the pure type of it in its simplicity; and then think of what {{corruption}} this passion is capable. I {{will give you a}} type of that also, and at your very doors. I cannot refer you to the time when the crime happened; but it was some four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> near Newcastle, and it has remained always as a ghastly landmark in my mind, owing to the horror of the external circumstances. The body of the murdered woman was found naked, rolled into a heap of ashes, at the mouth of one of your pits.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the work}} of one pushful, shoving creature, a man named Harman. Imagine him! Imagine what he must be! Don't you feel his soul defiling us?--this summit of a stupendous pile of--dough, {{thinking}} of nothing but his miserable monstrous profits, seeing nothing in the delight of life, the beauty of the world but something that attracts attention, draws eyes, something that gives him his horrible opportunity of getting ahead of all his poor little competitors and inserting--this! It's the quintessence of all that is wrong with the world;--squalid, shameless huckstering!" [...] He flew off at a tangent.

6000|$|... "I wonder, Mother, {{you never}} told me that, above all things, I should have to learn to squat on my heels for any time. It would not have been so {{difficult}} to learn it, <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when I was not anything like so heavy as I am now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Major," [...] {{continued}} the Colonel, half {{closing his eyes}} as if to follow the Major into the dreamy past, [...] "the old Major, sir, a matter of <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{was one of my}} most intimate political friends,--in fact, sir, my most intimate friend.

6000|$|... "You are {{somewhat}} blunt, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "So far as your Aunt Caroline is concerned, too, I fear {{that she has}} in a measure lost that fine edge--perhaps I should say that very delicate perception of the differences which undoubtedly do exist. I am pointing this out to you, Letitia," [...] he continued, {{as they left the}} Park, [...] "but {{it occurs to me that}} my doing so is unnecessary. I have noticed that since your entrance into Society, some four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> you have identified yourself entirely with my views.

60|$|Not {{far from}} the spot {{there is a point}} of rocks {{extending}} out farther into the ocean {{than the rest of the}} island. Some four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> there was a young woman residing at Gosport in the capacity of schoolteacher. She was of a romantic turn, and used to go and sit on this point of rock to view the waves. One day, when the wind was high, and the surf raging against the rocks, a great wave struck her, as she sat on the edge, and seemed to deprive her of sense; another wave, or the reflex of the same one, carried her off into the sea, and she was seen no more. This happened, I think, in 1846.|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S.--I {{perceive}} that in Germany, {{as well as}} in Italy, there is a [...] great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and [...] 'Romantic,'--terms which were not subjects of classification in [...] England, at least when I left it four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Some of [...] the English Scribblers, it is true, abused Pope and Swift, but the [...] reason was that they themselves {{did not know how to}} write either [...] prose or verse; but nobody thought them worth making a sect of. [...] Perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately, but I [...] have not heard much about it, and it would be such bad taste that I [...] shall be very sorry to believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Everyone {{has heard}} of the case of Elizabeth Canning,' writes Mr. John Paget; and till {{recently}} I agreed with him. But <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> the case of Elizabeth Canning repeated itself in a marvellous way, and then but few persons of my acquaintance {{had ever heard of}} that mysterious girl.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> I {{heard the}} name [...] "waahoo" [...] {{mentioned}} at Long Key.

For that matter, neither had I.|$|R
5000|$|John McGeoch (1991). [...] "I {{was doing}} some work at Eel Pie Studios <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and Townshend had left some guitar cases lying around the place. I opened one up {{and there was an}} {{acoustic}} guitar with a receipt dated 1969 ... The tuning on the guitar was D-A-D-A-D-E, bottom to top. That's what I used on 'Disappointed'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Betty's not my wife, you know; my wife wouldn't divorce me. The {{children}} are bastards, every jack one of them, {{and are they}} any the worse for that? Betty {{was one of the}} maids in the little red brick house in Kensington. Four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> I was on my uppers, and I had seven children, and I went to my wife and asked her to help me. She said she'd make me an allowance if I'd give Betty up and go abroad. Can you see me giving Betty up? We starved for a while instead. My wife said I loved the gutter. I've degenerated; I've come down in the world; I earn three pounds a week as press agent to a linendraper, and every day I thank God that I'm not in the little red brick house in Kensington." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nor I. But {{there are}} ways of failing besides the worst. However, I do not greatly fear this illness of mine taking root in them. It has {{not been in the}} family before; and I am nearly sure that I know when I took the infection, four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> from a poor man in Smoke-jack Alley, who would let no one lift him but me. They are healthy young things, all but dear little Cherry, and I hope they have spirits to keep care from making them otherwise. You will say a kind word to my little Cherry sometimes, Audley. Poor little woman, I am afraid it may fall sorely on her, she is of rather too highly strung a composition, and perhaps I have not acted so much for her good as my own pleasure, in the {{companionship}} we have had together.' ...|$|E
60|$|And here, also, {{they used}} to have a grand procession, of priests, citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the City Government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna--a stuffed and painted image, like a milliner's dummy--whose hair {{miraculously}} grew and restored itself every twelve months. They still kept up this shaving procession as late as four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> It was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkable effigy, and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always carried out with the greatest possible eclat and display--the more the better, because the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last a day came when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the City Government stopped the Madonna's annual show.|$|E
5000|$|The LA Weekly {{said of the}} band: [...] "The most mind-controlling band I {{ever saw}} was Indian Jewelry. During a set at the Echo four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> they found some top-secret dial {{on the back of}} their {{synthesizer}} and slowly started turning up the insanity, pounding away at the same unrelenting riff until a roomful of people was twitching and frothing at the mouth. So you could say I've got high hopes for this appearance at Part Time Punks' anniversary show. These weapons-grade Texan psychedelicists match truly primitive electronics, rhythms like Konono N°1, bleeps and wooshes from some kind of Soviet radar system, etc., to unending slo-mo distorto guitar that fills the room like boiling oil and ghost vocals from the other side. Like all Indian Jewelry releases, new album Peel It demands your total commitment. So hear ... and obey." [...] (Chris Ziegler) ...|$|R
5000|$|Xintai {{has a long}} history, it is the {{earliest}} origin of human civilization. [...] "Xintai Man" [...] {{is one of the}} oldest members of the Chinese family. In 1966, a Homo teeth fossil was found in Xintai Wuzhutai village. Through expert appraisal, this tooth belonged to a teenage woman. It indicates that 5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Homo erectus was living in this area. Moreover, a lot of primitive social sites was found on both sides of Chai Wen River after archaeological excavations, such as Dawenkou culture, Longshan culture and Yueshi culture.

Well, there was a gal about two years older than me lived up in the attic of one of the houses in the court along with a woman. I don't remember what the old one's name was now, but she used to drink awful. She was about fifteen--the gal I mean--and I was about twelve. That gal had something of the look of the lady in the picture, except that the picture is smiling, and she used in general to look cross.

6000|$|Close by the Lion of Lucerne is {{what they}} call the [...] "Glacier Garden"--and it is {{the only one in the}} world. It is on high ground. Four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> some workmen who were digging {{foundations}} for a house came upon this interesting relic of a long-departed age. Scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon. The soil was removed, and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey. This track was perforated by huge pot-shaped holes in the bed-rock, formed by the furious washing-around in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers. These huge round boulders still remain in the holes; they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in those old days.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} I cannot hear people rejoice in their summer sojourn as {{beyond the reach}} of excursionists without a certain rebellion; and yet I have to confess also that after {{spending}} a Sunday afternoon of late July, four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> with the excursionists at one of the beaches near New York, I was rather glad that my own summer sojourn was not within reach of them. I know very well that the excursionists must go somewhere, and as a man and a brother I am willing they should go anywhere, but as a friend of quiet and seclusion I should be sorry to have them come much where I am. It is not because I would deny them a share of any pleasure I enjoy, but because they are so many and I am so few that I think they would get all the pleasure and I none. I hope the reader will see how this attitude distinguishes me from the selfish people who inhumanly exult in their remoteness from excursionists.|$|E
