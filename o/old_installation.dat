5000|$|I {{was in the}} {{extermination}} camp of Jews for about two to three weeks. It was sometime in autumn 1942, but I don’t remember exactly when. At that time I was assigned by Wirth to enlarge the gassing structure according to the model of Treblinka.I went to Sobibor together with Lorenz Hackenholt, who {{was at that time}} in Treblinka. First of all, I went with Hackenholt to a sawmill near Warsaw. There Hackenholt ordered a big consignment of wood for reconstruction in Sobibor.Finally, both of us went to Sobibor. We reported there to the camp commander, Reichleitner. He gave us the exact directives for the construction of the gassing installations. The camp was already in operation, and there was a gassing installation. Probably the <b>old</b> <b>installation</b> was not big enough, and reconstruction was necessary.Today I cannot tell exactly who participated in the reconstruction work. However, I do remember that Jewish prisoners and so-called Askaries (Ukrainian auxiliaries) took part in the work.During this time that building was in progress, no transports with Jews arrived.|$|E

In view of these two factors as well as the fact that the University stands to gain from a well-populated IR, consistent and controlled exposure leading to visibility and promotion, complete record of scholarship, interconnection of different objects, archiving and preservation, copyright savings, partnership with national and global initiatives, the Academic Information Service developed a start-up strategy to which author self archiving (ASA) makes only a modest contribution and which may prove to be more cost-effective.

40|$|Degradation of {{pressurized}} topside static mud {{equipment is}} a very complex process. Inspection is a helpful tool to monitor degradation and helps reduce the number of critical failures. If it is left undetected and unchecked, it can lead to leakage resulting in accidents. To set up an effective inspection program, the concepts of Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) can be utilized. RBI helps to develop an optimum inspection program by evaluating the probability of failure (PoF) and consequence of failure (CoF), and combining them to estimate risk. The parts that have risk higher than the acceptable limit are then prioritized for inspection. This thesis studies the probability of failure in static equipment in pressurized mud systems on an offshore drilling installation, due to different degradation mechanisms and its influencing factors. Det Norske Veritas (DNV), suggests a number of models to estimate internal and external degradation. By analyzing inspection data from the industry, it is observed that the models can at times be inconvenient to use when the degradation process is complex. For example, it is difficult to develop a simple, yet reliable, model that can accurately predict rate of degradation in situations where corrosion and erosion are simultaneously taking place. In static equipment in high pressurized mud systems, inspection have shown that the main reason for internal degradation is high amounts of solids in the fluid, high velocity, presence of seawater, and corrosive chemicals. DNV-RP-G 101 does not present any model for this situation. For external corrosion, the current models presented in DNV-RP-G 101 can be used to analyze inspection data. In an <b>old</b> <b>installation,</b> the accurate quantitative records are often not available due to a number of reasons, like difficulty in measuring, old data management system, unsystematic inspections or lost records. Thus, it often becomes difficult to develop any qualitative model. On the other hand, the inspection and maintenance engineers have extensive experience that may be utilized for developing effective subjective models. In this thesis, based on some simplified parameters, a methodology for evaluating probability of failure is established. The methodology is divided into external and internal degradation, where the subjective judgments are more evident for internal degradation. Simplified flowcharts and tables are developed to easily evaluate probability of failure...|$|E

40|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of <b>older</b> <b>installations</b> in use on the Norwegian Continental shelf. Inspections are a key issue in ensuring the safety of an <b>older</b> <b>installation,</b> and the inspection intervals, inspection methods and its reliability are clearly influencing the safety of the installations. Different approaches for updating inspection plans for <b>older</b> <b>installations</b> are considered in order to achieve decreased inspection intervals as the structure are ageing. The most promising method consists in increasing the rate of defects / crack initiation {{at the end of the}} expected lifetime. Different system aspects are considered incl. assessment of the acceptable annual probability of failure for one component dependent on the number of critical components. Information obtained from inspection of one component can be used not only to update the inspection plan for that component, but also for other nearby components. An example indicates that a high degree of correlation between the uncertain parameters in different components is needed in order to obtain substantial information which can be used in inspection planning. Fatigue failure of one (or more) components does not necessary imply total collapse of the structure. The importance of each component can be measured by the RIF (Residual Influence Factor) for each component and is illustrated by examples. When an <b>installation</b> becomes <b>older</b> then the number of fatigue critical components can be expected to increase. If the maximum acceptable annual system probability of failure is the same as for a new installation, this implies that the acceptable annual fatigue probability of failure decrease, which again implies more inspections...|$|R
