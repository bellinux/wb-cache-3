5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected.

The exhibition was a great success, and was visited by around 14,000spectators. Among locomotives on exhibit were the land speed record holder Mallard and a Class 9F steam locomotive.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Peh-oe-ji has been heavily {{influenced}} by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it.

5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E
5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was {{partially}} transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained {{as part of}} the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Boris I (r. 852–889) Bulgaria {{underwent}} major changes— the Christianization {{of the country and}} the admission of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which marked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> and consolidation of the medieval Bulgarian literature and alphabet. Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country would fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate {{led to the creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham speaks of the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined {{to be part of the}} Book of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E

5|$|PA 563 {{was first}} created in 1928 to connect Bergey to Harrow, {{following}} its current alignment to PA313 before continuing straight along Ridge Road {{and continuing to}} PA412. By 1940, construction of the road into a state highway was completed. In the early 1970s, PA563 was moved to its current alignment north of PA313 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of Lake Nockamixon, which severed the original alignment.|$|E

It was directed by Tomm Moore and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2009. It was praised for sequences of animation drawing from the illuminated pages.|$|E
5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.|$|E

The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental piece of music.|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of strangelets decreases {{at higher}} energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion {{programs of the}} 1980s and 1990s, the LHC {{is less likely to}} produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} windows of the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creation</b> and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E
