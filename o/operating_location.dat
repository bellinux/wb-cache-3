25|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, {{modified}} for air-to-air refueling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson, departed its forward <b>operating</b> <b>location</b> at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00pm EDT, the aircraft {{was struck by a}} S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft was shot down, and Anderson was killed. The stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; it was only later believed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photoreconnaissance missions, were fired upon.|$|E
25|$|From October 1960, Detachment G {{made many}} overflights of Cuba from Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. Although Lockheed {{modified}} six CIA aircraft into the aerial refueling-capable U-2F model in 1961, permitting some Cuba missions to originate from Edwards, pilot fatigue limited flights to about 10 hours. An August 1962 flight showed Soviet SA-2 SAM {{sites on the}} island; later overflights found more sites and MiG-21 interceptors. The increasing number of SAMs caused the United States to more cautiously plan Cuban overflights. USAF U-2s did not conduct overflights, but officials believed {{that it would be}} better for a military officer to be the pilot in case he was shot down. Following one last Cuba overflight that originated from Edwards and ended at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida on 14 October 1962, all further U-2 operations over Cuba originated from a detachment <b>operating</b> <b>location</b> that was established at McCoy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Katrina made landfall, the Air National Guard had mobilized 840 {{personnel}} in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Although the Air National Guard had a domestic mission to support local authorities in rescue and relief operations following a natural disaster, its utilization for such missions had been limited primarily to {{a select group}} of career fields such as civil engineers, medical personnel, and services. In response to Hurricane Katrina, ANG units in all 54 states and territories responded to the recovery efforts in the Gulf States, with the Mississippi Air National Guard's Jackson Air National Guard Base serving as a hub and <b>operating</b> <b>location</b> for numerous active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Naval Reserve and Army National Guard aircraft. The ANG flew 73 percent of the airlift for the relief operations including its brand new C-130J and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft.

25|$|However, {{the base}} figured in {{numerous}} historic achievements in aviation during the 1920s. Lt. Jimmy Doolittle (who had accomplished his initial flight training at Rockwell years before) landed there in September 1922 after establishing {{a new record}} for the first transcontinental flight within a single day. The first nonstop transcontinental flight, originating at Roosevelt Field, New York, was accomplished by Army pilots and ended at Rockwell Field in May 1923. On 27 June of that year, pilots from Rockwell Field (Capt. Lowell H. Smith and 1st Lts. John P. Richter, Virgil Hine, and Frank W. Seifert) conducted the first complete aerial refueling between two airplanes. In {{the first week of}} 1929 the field was an <b>operating</b> <b>location</b> for another air refueling operation, in which a Douglas C-1 transport performed 27 sorties refueling the modified Atlantic-Fokker C-2 nicknamed the Question Mark. Charles A. Lindbergh's flight from New York City to Paris in May 1927 originated at Rockwell Field on North Island on 10 May 1927, when Lindbergh began the first leg of his journey.|$|E
