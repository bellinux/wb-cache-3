40|$|In a 4 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> echo {{may arise}} both by {{electrical}} crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset.

To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> for the 1A2 systems were modifications of the Bell System standard 500-series telephones for rotary dial systems, and the 2500-series Touch-Tone desk sets. For key system operation these sets were equipped {{with a set of}} push-buttons (keys) and additional internal contact springs to control the additional operational features, resulting in a large variety of specialty telephones. Specifically, such <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). <b>Telephone</b> <b>sets</b> could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R
50|$|LSI {{also allowed}} smaller systems to {{distribute}} the control (and features) into individual <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that don't require any single shared control unit. Generally, these systems are used with a relatively few <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.|$|R

50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack (type No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
