5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation {{of the works of}} persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> of the Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

Some of the withdrawn members joined the Conservative Party of Norway, others joined an entirely new organization (originally with the narrow intention to support the four parliamentarians), the quasi-political party Free Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E

5|$|The 1994 {{national}} convention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April {{at the hotel}} Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{was aware}} of the threat that Rivoli posed to their hegemony and were warned in advance by spies in Venice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> of the ship’s construction. As Rivoli neared completion, HMS Victorious was {{dispatched}} from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. Victorious was commanded by John Talbot, a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate Ville de Milan in 1805 and his service in the Dardanelles Operation of 1807. Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun brig HMS Weazel under Commander John William Andrew.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the brain is}} anatomical, and {{until the middle of}} the 20th century, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.|$|E
5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> manual docking system, TORU. The module's outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit depressurization {{in the history of}} spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.|$|E
40|$|Although Queen Elizabeth I of England made summer {{journeys}} or progresses {{almost every}} year from 1559 to 1602 very {{little attention has been}} focused on them and on the reasons for or <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> these trips. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this paper is twofold: (1) to describe <b>the</b> summer <b>progresses</b> and (2) to arrive at some conclusions as to <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> principal source <b>of</b> this paper is the three volume Nichols? collection of original documents concerning <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> These documents were collected from widely varying sources and published in 1823 by a printer named John Nichols. This material, either in the Nichols? collection or in the original, is <b>the</b> only source <b>of</b> information on <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> Every secondary work examined by <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> this paper used one of these sources for his information about <b>the</b> <b>progresses.</b> <b>The</b> main significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> was to allow the crown to keep in personal touch with the provincial officials and with the general public. Both the people and the officials were appreciative of this royal attention and it contributed to the favorable public opinion which Elizabeth enjoyed during her entire reign. The public exposure which <b>the</b> <b>progresses</b> gave to Elizabeth created a bond between the Queen and her subjects which enabled her to govern with a freer hand than she {{would have been able to}} do otherwise. Of secondary importance these journeys allowed the Queen a chance to relax somewhat from <b>the</b> formality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court and to enjoy some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sporting entertainments such as hunting which were impossible to do in London...|$|R

5|$|In 1927, the Simon Commission {{which was}} {{appointed}} {{to report on the}} working <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms landed in India. The Swarajya Party moved a resolution to boycott the Commission and this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. The Justice Party and the Swarajists supported the resolution while the Chief Minister P. Subbarayan opposed it and requested his ministers to resign. However, Lord Goschen, the Governor, was able to obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal by making a Justice Party member, M. Krishnan Nair, a Cabinet minister. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterwards, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government accorded the Commission a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|Persia at {{the time}} was divided into British and Russian spheres of influence, with a neutral zone in between. Germany {{exercised}} influence over the central parts of the country through their consulate in Isfahan. The local populace and the clergy, opposed to Russian and British semi-colonial designs on Persia, offered support to the mission. Niedermayer and von Hentig's groups reconnoitred Isfahan until the end of June. The Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, was already receiving reports of pro-German sympathies among Persian and Afghan tribes. Details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> of the expedition were being keenly sought by British intelligence. By now, British and Russian columns close to the Afghan border, including the Seistan Force, were hunting for the expedition. If the expedition was to reach Afghanistan, it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of miles in the extreme heat and natural hazards of the Persian desert, while evading brigands and ambushes.|$|E
