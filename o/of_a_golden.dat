5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but it {{certainly}} has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E

5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over the rays <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in purple and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star.|$|E
5|$|The seven castles are {{traditionally}} considered {{a symbol of}} the Portuguese victories over their Moorish enemies, under Afonso III, who supposedly captured seven enemy fortresses {{in the course of his}} conquest of the Algarve, concluded in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve in 1385, to seven in 1485 and to eleven in 1495; it then changed back to seven, in 1578, this time definitively. An hypothesis about the origin of the castles on a red bordure lies in the family ties of Afonso III with Castile (both his mother and second wife were Castilian), whose arms consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> castle on a red field.|$|E
5|$|The victors {{also found}} a golden crown among the booty. It was reputed {{to be from the}} time of the fifteenth-century Majapahit empire, during which there were reports of the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> crown. The crown was handed to Captain Tack of the VOC, who insisted on {{requiring}} 1,000 Rds. before giving it to the king. This behaviour seemed to offend the king and might have contributed to Tack's death at the Mataram court in 1686. On 27 November, Hurdt presented the crown to the king, who proceeded to wear it. In an act of cultural misunderstanding, the VOC fired musket and cannon salutes, thinking the event was a coronation in the European sense. In reality, crowns did not have ceremonial importance in Javanese royal protocol. This episode attracted much attention among later historians. Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf opined that the king would later consider this event as a symbol of the European's condescension and that they were instrumental to the king's legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching {{in the corner of the}} room, and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> heart necklace, the other half of which was found at the scene of the crime.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

5|$|Sita is {{the heroine}} of Ramayana and the consort of the Hindu god Rama (avatar of Vishnu) {{and is an}} avatar of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth and wife of Vishnu. She is esteemed as a standard-setter for wifely and womanly virtues for all Hindu women. Sita is adopted {{daughter}} of Janaka, king of Videha, found while he was furrowing the earth. The prince of Ayodhya, Rama wins Sita in her svayamvara. Later, when Rama is sentenced to a fourteen-year exile, Sita joins Rama and his brother Lakshmana in exile, despite Rama's wish for her to remain in Ayodhya. While in exile in Dandaka forest, she falls prey to Ravana's scheme and sends Rama away in quest <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> deer, while she is kidnapped by Ravana. Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. Sita proves her chastity by undergoing a trial by fire. Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where Rama is coronated as king. When a washerman casts doubts about her chastity, Rama abandons a pregnant Sita in the forest. Sita gives birth to twins Lava and Kusha in the hermitage of sage Valmiki, who protects her. Her sons grow and reunite with Rama and again Sita is asked to prove her chastity before Rama can take her back. However, Sita chooses {{to return to the}} womb of her mother, Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
