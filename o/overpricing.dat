5|$|Lavagna {{refused to}} run for senator in the 2005 midterm elections, and criticized the <b>overpricing</b> of public works managed by Minister of Federal Planning Julio de Vido. As a result, Kirchner asked Lavagna to resign. Finance {{secretary}} Guillermo Nielsen, who managed the debt restructuring, also resigned. Felisa Miceli, head of Banco de la Nación Argentina, replaced Lavagna as Minister of Economy. Miceli resigned in 2007, months before the presidential elections, because of a scandal over a bag with {{a large amount of}} money which was found in her office bathroom.

25|$|The {{inability}} to repay debt in an LBO {{can be caused}} by initial <b>overpricing</b> of the target firm and/or its assets. Over-optimistic forecasts of the revenues of the target company may also lead to financial distress after acquisition. Some courts have found that in certain situations, LBO debt constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. insolvency law if it is determined to be the cause of the acquired firm's failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} <b>overpricing</b> {{is also an}} {{important}} consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value {{on the first day of}} trading. If so, the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|E

40|$|Buying {{is easier}} than {{shorting}} for many equity investors. Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among <b>overpriced</b> stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among <b>overpriced</b> stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among <b>overpriced</b> stocks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{close link}} between mispricing and liquidity by investigating stocks with high analyst disagreement. Previous research finds that these stocks {{tend to be}} <b>overpriced,</b> but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks {{tend to be more}} severely <b>overpriced.</b> Additionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the convergence of prices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the initially <b>overpriced</b> stocks are negatively correlated with the time series of innovations in aggregate market liquidity.
