25|$|It {{follows that}} the most {{effective}} field placements for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the outfield and the slips cordon and gully since these are the positions in which the batsman {{is most likely to}} be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> a batsman can score a boundary. Other close fielding positions such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.|$|E

500|$|In {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> there is {{geothermal}} activity, wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements {{that allow them}} to erupt like geysers. The vents of such geysers are artificial, but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems. These so-called artificial geysers, technically known as erupting geothermal wells, are not true geysers. Little Old Faithful Geyser, in Calistoga, California, is an example. The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century. According to Dr. John Rinehart in his book A Guide to Geyser Gazing (1976 p.49), a man had drilled into the geyser in search for water. He had [...] "simply opened up a dead geyser".|$|E

500|$|The synod at Croft held by Wiglaf in 836, which Beorhtwulf {{may have}} attended, {{was the last}} such {{conclave}} called together by a Mercian king. [...] During Beorhtwulf's reign and thereafter, the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury. [...] A charter of 840 provides evidence {{of a different kind}} concerning Beorhtwulf's relations with the church. [...] The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire. [...] The lands had come {{under the control of the}} church in Worcester, but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again. [...] In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church's right to the land, but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return: [...] "four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds, and two silver horns of four pounds ..... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds." [...] This is not an isolated case; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church, such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester, and promised in return that he would be [...] "more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community" [...] and, in the words of historian Patrick Wormald, [...] "would not rob them in future". [...] Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find, as so much land had been granted to monasteries. [...] The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede, who in a letter to Egbert, the Archbishop of York, had complained of [...] "a complete lack <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate". [...] Beorhtwulf's concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement, and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure.|$|E
