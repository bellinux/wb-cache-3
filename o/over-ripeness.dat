I have read of an unlucky sage who discovered the Elixir of Life, and who, after thrice renewing his existence, at last voluntarily resigned himself to death, because he had exhausted all that life had to offer of pleasure or of pain, and knew all its vicissitudes but the very last. Brother Karabagiak seems to have had no humor to take even a second ease of life. It is perhaps as well that most men die before reaching the <b>over-ripeness</b> of a hundred and eight years; and, doubtless, with all our human willfulness and ignorance, we would readily consent, if we could fix the time, to go sooner--say, at a hundred and seven years, friends? ...|$|E

She could not help hoping a little in a certain awe she had observed herself to inspire, when she appeared, unknown and unexpected, in her religious dress. As she passed across a breadth of cultivated ground, she noticed, with wonder, that little patches of corn mingled with the other crops had been left to <b>over-ripeness</b> untouched by the sickle, and that golden apples and dark figs lay rotting on the weedy earth. There were grassy spaces within sight, but no cow, or sheep, or goat.

5000|$|The Trobriand peoples speak Kilivila, though various {{different}} dialects {{of it are}} spoken amongst each different tribe. It is an Austronesian language, although has {{the distinction}} of having a complex system for classifying nouns. Foreign languages are less commonly spoken, although by the 1980s at least, Trobrianders occasionally spoke Tok Pisin and English. The term [...] "Trobriand" [...] itself is not Kilivilan: the islands take this name from the French explorer Jean François Sylvestre Denis de Trobriand who visited in 1793.Drawing upon earlier work by Bronisław Malinowski, Dorothy D. Lee's scholarly writings refer to [...] "non-lineal codifications of reality". In such a linguistic system, the concept of linear progress of time, geometric shapes, and even conventional methods of description, are lost altogether or altered. In her example of a specific indigenous yam, Lee explains that when the yam moves from a state of sprouting through ripeness to <b>over-ripeness,</b> the name for each object in a specific state changes entirely - {{the description of the}} object at different states of development relates to wholly different perceptions of the object. Ripeness is considered a [...] "defining ingredient" [...] and thus once it becomes over-ripe, a yam is perceived as a new object altogether. The same perception pertains to time and geometric shapes.|$|E
5000|$|Frightened by a thunderstorm, the Gauls — {{with the}} {{exception}} of Getafix, who is at his annual druid meeting — are huddled in the chief's hut, when they are visited by a soothsayer, called Prolix, who predicts that [...] "when the storm is over, the weather will improve" [...] and additionally predicts a fight (caused by the villagers' habitual argument over the <b>over-ripeness</b> of fish sold by fishmonger Unhygenix). Asterix alone correctly identifies the soothsayer as a charlatan. Upon Prolix's departure, the chief's wife Impedimenta preserves him in hiding near the village, where she and the other villagers question him at will; forbidding only Asterix and Obelix. Later, Obelix eludes Impedimenta and, upon encountering him, chases Prolix into a tree. When he threatens to uproot it, Prolix diverts him by claiming to see a vision of a beautiful woman who loves warriors matching Obelix's description. Obelix returns to the village and almost instantly falls for Mrs. Geriatrix. Prolix meanwhile is arrested by a Roman Optio (a senior officer). The Optio brings Prolix before the Centurion, who decides to use the imposter's persuasive voice against the Gauls. Upon Impedimenta's discovery of Asterix near Prolix's camp, consternation spreads among the villagers on grounds of a threatened sacrilege. At the Romans' behest, Prolix returns, claiming dramatically that soon the air in the village will become polluted by a divine curse. Terrified, most of the villagers wait on a nearby island for the curse to exhaust itself, while Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix stay behind.|$|E
40|$|When can {{you tell}} that a {{watermelon}} is ripe in the field? I have several opinions on the matter from letting it sit until it splits, to picking one to sample. Do any of you know the answer? It is said that {{the sound of a}} thump is a ringing sound when the fruit is green, and a dull or dead one when ripe. The problem with thumping is that the dull-dead sound is also a sign of <b>over-ripeness.</b> A better sign is that in most varieties the 'ground spot' {{on the bottom of the}} melon turns from light straw to a richer yellow.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that one-fourth of the fresh fruits harvested are never consumed because of spoilage. This spoilage amounts to many thousands of tons of fruits which are valued annually at several million dollars. Several factors are responsible for the post-harvest spoilage of fruits, namely, pathological, physiological, and mechanical. Men in the past have used various methods to control pathological spoilage of foods. The recent development of nuclear radiation, antibiotics, fungicides, and packaging films provides new methods for prolonging the shelf-life of many fruits. These may prove important in countries like India where refrigeration facilities are not readily available and food shortage has always been a problem. Likewise, in the United States, the present-day marketing of fresh fruits has become more and more complex because centers of consumption are increasingly remote from centers of production. To understand physiological and mechanical spoilage of fruits one should know that perishable products are alive, even though the connection with the source of nourishment has been severed. Continued metabolism and increase in respiration result in <b>over-ripeness,</b> physiological decay, and wilting. The deterioration of fruits by the processes of accelerated respiration induced by ripening, physical changes, and subsequent mechanical damage during transit cannot be stopped; but it can be retarded by lowering the temperature, by treating with respiratory inhibitors, and by careful handling...|$|E
40|$|This {{bibliography}} is {{a companion}} to G 110, 'A bibliography on post-harvest losses in cereals and pulses with particular reference to tropical and sub-tropical countries', by J. M. Adams (TPI, 1977). Whereas G 110 covered storage, the present bibliography deals with the post-harvest processes from threshing to milling, with some abstracts on the secondary processes (cooking, baking, fermentation etc). The present world food situation has led technologists to look critically at all aspects of food production {{in order to increase}} the world's food resources. One aspect only recently studied with any great seriousness is the assessment and reduction of food processing losses. Losses occur at all stages of the food chain. Moreover, some losses made manifest at one point are caused earlier in the chain. Some obvious examples come to mind: failure to apply fertilizer leads to low yields; <b>over-ripeness</b> leads to threshing losses; bad threshing or drying techniques with paddy lead to broken rice at the mill, and so on. lt is always possible to reduce loss empirically, without prior assessment of the loss. However, to justify the necessary inputs of finance, labour etc, to reduce loss it is wise to assess the loss and measure its cost. In assessing loss two basic methods are available: (a) measurement of whole system, and (b) comparison of one process with a standard or optimal process. In (a) the loss itself is weighed. For example, by removing and weighing grain left on the stalk after threshing. In (b) the process is compared, in terms of yields and values, with an optimized, usually laboratory, process. All other unit operations in the processing chain are carried out in an identical way. For example, identical samples of maize cobs are dried to different moisture levels and then shelled: kernel damage is then compared. In this bibliography are abstracts of many useful technical papers on processing losses of cereals and grain legumes. Some areas are much better covered_than others, and it is hoped that this bibliography will spur researchers to concentrate on neglected areas. The introductory remarks 1 o some sections are taken from the AACC/LI FE publication 'Post-harvest Grain Loss Assessment Methods' (see page 3, A 1). NOTE: The lay-out of this bibliography is similar to that which has been so successfully used in the Composite Flour Bibliographies (G 89 and G 111), and it is hoped that users will find the system appropriate in the present case...|$|E
40|$|The {{decadence}} {{that the}} Decadents identified {{in their own}} civilization was recognized through the model of Roman Empire, although they thought that the Romans were, even in their decadence, much more vigorous than the modern "cerebral" decadents. The figures of the late Empire, which fused the <b>over-ripeness</b> of culture with barbarism, were great even in their decline; the ancient uninhibited transgressions and vices fascinated the decadents although even the imagined debaucheries exhausted the modern decadents. Des Esseintes is, of course, a paradigmatic figure, connecting extreme weakness and fragility {{of the nervous system}} with wild sadistic dreams. He is capable of producing vigorous mental images, imagining sublimely horrible figures and emblems of disease, which fell on a fertile ground in later decadent writings. At the same time, the idea of the savage and the primitive which had underwent a radical change, when the romantic idea of the noble savage was replaced by the primitive as the lowest order of humanity, became fashionable even among many Decadents. This debauched barbarian or savage (whose representatives or relics the survived "primitive cultures" were) marked the beginnings of human culture and was the suppressed foundation of all developed cultures. The danger of the return of this primitive side of man could threaten even the most civilized individuals or nations if the ties and restraints of culture were loosened (Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness represents this perfectly).   For the decadents, who did not see their own civilization in the terms of progress any more, and embraced ideas of entropy, dissolution and return to a state of new barbarism, the idea of the decline of their culture, thus, could become connected with the idea of the primitive "in us", the primitive lurking in the psyche of every individual and the primitive that was built in the culture itself. As the primitive became, increasingly, identified not only with "primitive peoples" or "primitive races" mostly inhabiting in the colonies or far-out regions, but with groups within the civilized society, like workers, paupers, lower classes, Jews or even women, it was easy to find seeds and forces of the foreseen and, at the same time, feared development. When these ideas were connected with Nietzscheanism, like in the early novels by the Finnish author Joel Lehtonen, they produced a provocative form of Dionysian Decadence; a manic form of decadence combining primitive energies with provocative questioning of traditional cultural values. It was Nietzsche himself who suggested the idea that the "tropical man" or the primitive seen as the evil to be eradicated by the moralists should be recognized as a potentially positive force (Beyond Good and Evil, 197). Lehtonen's decadent figures (especially in his novel Mataleena 1905) find their roots in the primitive life of the Finnish "wilderness" and connect this primitiveness to a provocative decadence, which is à rebours, against all recognized cultural values but has power only as a form of deconstruction and destruction...|$|E
