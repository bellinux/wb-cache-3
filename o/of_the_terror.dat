5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror</b> was {{undertaken}} by Flying Patrols; cavalry units, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20, under the absolute authority of an experienced adult leader. The detachments, specialiced in search-and-destroy operations were Death Squads similar to German Sturmbattalions and Russian Assault units organized during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The main goals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror</b> was {{to destroy}} the power {{structure}} of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political violence as a military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror.</b> He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E

Franco until 1945 — six years after the war's end in 1939.

5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror</b> campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.|$|E
25|$|Some victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror</b> were American {{immigrants}} to the Soviet Union, who had emigrated {{at the height of}} the Great Depression to find work. At the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terror,</b> American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for passports so they could leave the Soviet Union. They were turned away by embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside by lurking NKVD agents. Many were subsequently shot dead at Butovo Field near Scherbinka, south of Moscow. In addition, 141 American Communists of Finnish origin were executed and buried at Sandarmokh. 127 Finnish Canadians were also shot and buried there.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Red <b>Terror</b> was {{a period}} of intense {{political}} and inter-communal violence in revolutionary Ethiopia during the late 1970 s. This violence erupted two years after <b>the</b> revolution <b>of</b> 1974 and was concentrated in the cities and towns of Ethiopia, and particularly in Addis Ababa, Gondar, Mekele, Asmara, and Dessie. In the struggle over the direction and ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution, opposition groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radical left violently opposed a military regime that itself came to embrace and promulgate Marxist-Leninist language and policies, and which heavily relied on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> armed force to stifle dissent. While much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence was carried out by security personnel, <b>the</b> delegation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state’s means and instruments of violence to newly formed militias and to armed citizens was a defining feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror.</b> <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> casualties and victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror</b> remains heavily contested and is subject to divergent counting criteria and to definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terror’s</b> scope in relation to other concurrent conflicts in the region, such as the Eritrean and Tigrayan civil wars; plausible figures are as high as 150. 000, in addition to the many more who were subjected to torture, exile, personal losses and other forms of violence. To this day, <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror</b> constitutes a period that is remembered in Ethiopia as much for <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> its violence as for its extent. Its ramifications, from the support it triggered for the ethno-nationalist insurgencies that overthrew the military regime in 1991 to its role in <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> a sizeable Ethiopian diaspora, make <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror</b> an episode of defining and lasting significance in <b>the</b> modern history <b>of</b> Ethiopia...|$|R

25|$|German {{reaction}} to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced {{the overthrow of the}} king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terror</b> disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.|$|E
25|$|In 1791, two representatives on mission {{informed}} the National Assembly of the disquieting condition of Vendée, and this news was quickly {{followed by the}} exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rouerie.

25|$|On 26 August 2017, {{hundreds}} of thousands marched down the Passeig de Gràcia in Barcelona.

Other demonstrators displayed Spanish and Catalan flags and the majority did not politicise the event.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Red <b>Terror</b> was {{a period}} of {{political}} repression and mass killings carried out by Bolsheviks after <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Civil War in 1918.

However, the term was frequently applied to Bolshevik political repression during <b>the</b> whole period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil War (1917–1922), as distinguished from <b>the</b> White <b>Terror</b> carried out by the anti-Bolshevik side. The Cheka (the Bolshevik secret police) carried out <b>the</b> repressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror.</b> Estimates for <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> people killed during <b>the</b> Red <b>Terror</b> for <b>the</b> initial period <b>of</b> repression are at least 10,000.

25|$|While reports {{taken from}} German prisoners speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terror</b> they {{experienced}} from the bombardment, {{there is no}} evidence that naval gun fire caused great destruction to the German guns. As a result of the non-destruction of the guns, infantry had to be used to capture them. Nevertheless, the naval gunfire was effective in neutralizing the German batteries, disabling 22 of their 24 assigned targets, and during the bombardment there were long periods during which German gun positions fell silent. This was later attributed to the demoralizing effect that they had on the German gunners, rather than a destructive effect on the guns. The fire support provided by the task force's small ships proved to be more effective, and according to Allied reports after the bombardment this was the most effective aspect of the bombardment.|$|E
