5|$|Political {{sociology}} {{has also}} moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed {{the role of}} non-governmental organizations, the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> throughout the Earth as a social construct, {{and the role of}} stateless entities in the modern world society. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and human rights.|$|E
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state.</b> The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church, although hereditary descent from uncles to nephews is also seen in the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> is the {{creation}} of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

Although {{it would be difficult}} to systematically demonstrate that the non-alignment has been a common accepted ideology among <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conference, it is also equally difficult, based on historical facts and <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> alliances that took place after the conference, to argue persuasively that it was not an ideologically based forum.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the concept and {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation state in <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time-space compression. <b>The</b> main goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is to prove that nation-state activities has increased and developed the new event formats by separated from <b>the</b> traditional forms <b>of</b> activity {{as an alternative to}} the hypothesis which means that the nation states have lost their effectiveness and become historically vanishing. The study also aims to obtain the controversial results related to <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-states</b> based on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> scientific knowledge. A discussion is composed by conceiving the significant difference in perspective with a created logical string and showing that the generally presented propositions can be viewed from different frames.

30|$|The federalist {{paradigm}} mainly {{relies on}} a constructivist epistemology, which has a significant limitation in explaining/knowing <b>the</b> <b>nation-state.</b> Particularly, constructivist epistemology conceives <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> as an individual-like actor in a socio-psychological context but not a strong institution (Carlsnaes, 1992). In the same vein, from a Wendtian logic (see: Wendt, 1999), <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> as an individual is actually {{a product of a}} broader structure. Thus, according to this logic, <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a supranational EU emerges as an automatic outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interactions between <b>nation-states</b> (individuals) in <b>the</b> broader EU structure (Johnston, 2001). According to this understanding, sovereignty is also exogenous to <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> because it is given to a nation-state by other states (it is not an outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state’s</b> historically institutionalized governance capacity and legitimacy) (Bull, 2002). Therefore, this logic assumes that <b>the</b> collective behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member states in the normative EU structure would develop a new kind of ‘solidarity’ which might substitute ‘sovereignty’ as a core for a polity formation. However, ‘solidarity’ is in practice a weak concept to substitute ‘sovereignty’ for several reasons.|$|R

Altogether there was a gradual language shift towards Spanish language in the Basque-speaking areas of the Spanish Basque Country, a phenomenon initially restricted to the upper urban classes, but progressively reaching the lower classes. Western Biscay, most of Alava and southern Navarre have been Spanish-speaking (or Romance-speaking) for centuries.|$|E

Previous regional independence movements such as the Greek revolt in the Ottoman Empire, the division and redivision of the Latin American political map, and the British-French Crimean triumph leading to an interest in redrawing Europe along cultural differences, all conspired to make for a time of upheaval and uncertainty about the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state.</b>|$|E
500|$|Many New Agers {{advocate}} globalisation and localisation, but reject {{nationalism and}} the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state.</b> Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government. Satin for example argued for a {{move away from the}} nation-state and towards self-governing regions which, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity. Benjamin Creme conversely argued that [...] "the Christ," [...] a great Avatar, Maitreya, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their [...] "Awaited One," [...] would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government {{in the form of the}} United Nations; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy. Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of democracy and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of representative democracy and majority rule, thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.|$|E
40|$|Many {{scholars}} have recently argued that nation-state—centered approaches in comparative sociology {{and political science}} are obsolete. In this view, we have entered, or are about to enter, a new “postnational” or “transnational” era characterized by complex and qualitatively new patterns of multilevel governance, in which <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> still plays a role, though a drastically reduced one. 1 This decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state’s</b> sovereignty {{is said to be}} accompanied by a growing importance of supranational and transnational actors, institutions, legal norms, and discourses, on the one hand, and increased local autonomy from national constraints, on the other.

500|$|Scholars of German {{history have}} engaged in decades of debate over how the successes and {{failures}} of the Frankfurt Parliament contribute to the historiographical explanations of German nation building. One school of thought, which emerged after The Great War and gained momentum {{in the aftermath of}} World War II, maintains that the failure of German liberals in the Frankfurt Parliament led to bourgeoisie compromise with conservatives (especially the conservative Junker landholders), which subsequently led to the so-called Sonderweg (distinctive path) of 20th-century German history. Failure to achieve unification in 1848, this argument holds, resulted in the late formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> in 1871, which in turn delayed the development of positive national values. Hitler often called on the German public to sacrifice all for the cause of their great nation, but his regime did not create German nationalism: it merely capitalized on an intrinsic cultural value of German society that still remains prevalent even to this day. Furthermore, this argument maintains, the [...] "failure" [...] of 1848 reaffirmed latent aristocratic longings among the German middle class; consequently, this group never developed a self-conscious program of modernization.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 Williams {{delivered}} the Richard Dimbleby lecture and chose {{to talk about}} the problematic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> but also of its successors. He cited the so-called 'market state' as offering an inadequate vision of the way a state should operate, partly because it was liable to short-term and narrowed concerns (thus rendering it incapable of dealing with, for instance, issues relating to the degradation of the natural environment) and partly because a public arena which had become value-free was liable to disappear amidst the multitude of competing private interests. (He noted the same moral vacuum in British society after this visit to China in 2006.) He is not uncritical of communitarianism, but his reservations about consumerism have been a constant theme.

2500|$|The Age of Enlightenment was a {{powerful}} intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.

Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation-state,</b> as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration, law, and education. The Congress of Vienna, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five [...] "Great Powers": the UK, France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia. This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted. The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.|$|E
