Transposed to other disciplines, “narrative” is often a substitute for “assumption”, “hypothesis”, a disguised ideological stance, a cognitive scheme, and even life itself. The potential for broadening the concept lay dormant in narratology, both in the double use of “narrative” for the medium-free fabula and for the medium-bound sjuzet, and in changing interpretations of “event”. Some advantages of the broad use of “narrative” are an evocation of commonalities among media and disciplines, an invitation to re-think the term within the originating discipline, a constructivist challenge to positivistic and foundational views, an emphasis on a plurality of competing “truths”, and an empowerment of minority voices. Conversely, disadvantages of the broad use are an illusion of sameness whenever the term is used and the obliteration of specificity. In a Wittgensteinian spirit, the essay agrees that concepts of narrative are mutually related by “family resemblance”, but wishes to probe the resemblances further. It thus postulates two necessary features: double temporality and a transmitting (or mediating) agency, and an additional cluster of variable <b>optional</b> <b>characteristics.</b> When the necessary features are not dominant, the configuration may have “narrative elements” but is not “a narrative”...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{international}} sample of 222 banks from 41 countries, {{this study examines}} whether the fair value option (FVO) affects earnings volatility. Prior empirical studies associate higher levels of earnings volatility with fair value accounting (Barth et al. 1995; Hodder et al. 2006). In contrast, I find evidence that banks applying the FVO to reduce accounting mismatches exhibit lower earnings volatility than other banks. I assign this alternative outcome to the <b>optional</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the FVO. Banks can use the flexibility in accounting to reduce artificial earnings volatility. The cross-sectional results are robust against outliers and several model alterations, including controls for endogeneity bias. Furthermore, I predict and find that banks from countries with high regulatory quality {{are more likely to}} apply the FVO to reduce accounting mismatches. Overall, the findings confirm the IASB’s initial intention on introducing the FVO. Hence, the study contributes to the current debate on the use of fair values in financial reporting...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} {{acoustics}} of aspiration {{noise in the}} intersegmental transition between a vowel and a following fricative, and how Scottish English speakers use this turbulence to convey phonologicalphonetic structure. ‘Preaspiration’ – the perceptually salient aspiration present in vowel-obstruent transitions – is usually associated with stops rather than fricatives, both at phonological and phonetic levels of description. This study describes the occurrence of phonetic (nonnormative) preaspiration of voiceless fricatives in Scottish Standard English (SSE), spoken in the Central Belt of Scotland. This variety-specific <b>optional</b> <b>characteristic</b> is variably present in different SSE speakers, and results from a learnt dissociation of the lingual and supralaryngeal gestures required for voiceless fricatives. The aims {{of this study are}} to explore the acoustic characteristics of preaspirated fricatives in SSE and the potential linguistic functioning of preaspiration as a correlate of the fricative /voice/ contrast. In doing so, we will contribute to the sparse acoustic literature on preaspirated fricatives; bridge the gap between possible functional and co-articulatory explanations of this phenomenon; and present a new analytical method to quantify the glottal aperiodic turbulence in the vowel and vowel-fricative transitions independently from the offset of periodic phonation...|$|R
40|$|Preaspiration {{is usually}} {{associated}} with stops rather than fricatives, both at phonological and phonetic levels of description. This study reports the occurrence of phonetic (nonnormative) preaspiration of voiceless fricatives in Scottish Standard English (SSE) spoken in the Central Belt of Scotland. We classify it as non-normative because it is variably present in different speakers, but the distribution is nevertheless understandable on phonetic grounds. The paper analyses the phonetic distribution of preaspiration and its functions in SSE. Preaspiration is shown to occur more frequently after open vowels and phrase-finally. Sociophonetic conditioning by speaker’s sex is {{not found to be}} relevant. Functional analysis shows that preaspiration (reflected in the amount of noise in mid/high spectralfrequencies) is a systematic correlate of phonological fricative /voice/ contrast phrase finally. In this context, it appears to be even stronger predictor of /±voice/ than such traditionally-considered correlates as voicing offset and segmental duration. The results show that abstract non-neutralised /voice/ is phonetically multidimensional such that fricative preaspiration can maintain the contrast in the contexts where phonetic voicing is demoted. The extent and functioning of preaspiration in SSE suggests that it is a varietyspecific <b>optional</b> <b>characteristic</b> resulting from a learned dissociation of lingual and laryngeal stricture gestures in voiceless fricatives...|$|R

For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the results of}} postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) {{for the treatment of}} pathologic N 2 b/c squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (OSCC). Materials and Methods: This study reviewed cancer registry data collected in our hospital from 1998 to 2009 with the following inclusion criteria: primary OSCC, treatment with radical surgery, and multiple nodal metastases. Patients who had extracapsular spreading of the lymph node metastases or positive resection margins or who refused to undergo PORT were excluded. The prescribed dose of PORT was 60 – 66 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was <b>optional.</b> Patient <b>characteristics,</b> treatment parameters and clinical outcome were recorded. The primary end point was overall survival, and the secondary endpoint was disease status. Results: There were 138 eligible cases, and the median follow-up period was 35 months. The 3 -year overall survival rate was 56 %. Univariate analysis revealed that pathologic T 4 status (pT 4), bone marrow invasion, and lymphatic invasion were significantly correlated with poor outcome (p, 0. 05). Multivariate analysis showed that pT 4, lymphatic invasion, and the no concurrent chemotherapy were independent poor prognostic factors (p, 0. 05). Fifty-four patients had tumor recurrence. The 3 -year recurrence-free survival rate was 59 %. Skin invasion, pT 4, and bone marrow invasion were correlated with poor prognosis in the univariate analysis (p, 0. 05). Only pT 4 (p, 0. 01) and no concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0. 03) wer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this research, we {{undertake}} a systematic {{review of literature}} about Online Peer Assessment (OPA) in higher education, mediated by Digital Information and Communication Technology (DICT). We identify their <b>optional</b> and central <b>characteristics</b> and we map out practices (procedures and DICT) which can be transversal, adaptable and applied in several curriculum units and education regimes. The results indicate the use of OPA as a strategy that boosts “assessment for learning”. The methods of assessment {{and the kinds of}} DICT used indicate directions for greater involvement and responsibility from the part of the student in his/her learning. Existing literature identifies the need to develop students’ skills, proving them with opportunities for self-assessment and peer assessment on a regular basis through constructive feedback. From the results obtained, OPA is seen as a cognitive tool, contributing to the building of knowledge and to reflection about learning. Issues for further reflection are also identified such as the creative development of assessment methods with a focus on diversity and innovation in order to enhance students’ learning and academic results, taking into account their learning needs in face of the expectations of current and future education and the demands of society...|$|R
