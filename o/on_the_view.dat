5|$|The dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the {{senators}} of Rome {{rushed to the}} Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion condemning his memory to oblivion.

5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{that the natural}} system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E
5|$|The fourth marquess, John Crichton-Stuart, was an {{enthusiastic}} restorer and builder and commissioned a major restoration project between 1928 and 1939. The stonework was carefully repaired, with moulds made to recreate missing pieces. The Inner East Gatehouse was rebuilt, {{along with several}} of the other towers. The marquess carried out landscaping work, {{with the intent of}} eventually re-flooding the lakes, and thanks to several decades of purchases was finally able to demolish the local houses encroaching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
