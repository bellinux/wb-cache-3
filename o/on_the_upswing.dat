2500|$|Carmichael's eulogy for [...] "hot" [...] jazz, however, was premature. Big-band swing {{was just}} around the corner, and jazz would soon turn in another {{direction}} with new bandleaders, such as the Dorseys and Benny Goodman, and new singers, such as Bing Crosby, leading the way. Carmichael's output followed the changing trend. In 1933 he began a long-lasting collaboration with lyricist Johnny Mercer, newly arrived in New York, on [...] "Lazybones", which became a hit. Southern Music published the sheet music in 1933; more than 350,000 copies of it were sold in three months. [...] Carmichael collaborated with Mercer on nearly three dozen songs, including [...] "Thanksgiving," [...] "Moon Country," [...] and the 1951 Academy Award-winner for best song, [...] "In the Cool, Cool, Cool, of the Evening." [...] Carmichael's financial condition improved dramatically when royalties started to pour in, affording him a comfortable apartment and dapper clothes.

40|$|Large-scale land {{acquisition}} in Africa {{has been the}} concern and the focus of growing global literature <b>on</b> land grabbing. <b>The</b> <b>upswing</b> in biofuel investments in Ghana led to large-scale {{land acquisition}}s {{by the private sector}} presided over by chiefs. This research investigates how chiefs, in playing their traditional roles in the acquisition of land and as arbitrators, were, in most instances, the cause and the solution to the ensuing conflicts in the various communities. Data was collected through interviews, use of questionnaires and focus group discussions. Some of the conflict issues include loss of farmlands or other communal lands, disagreements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land acquisition processes, the quantum and mode of execution of compensation payments and the existence or contents of social responsibility agreements. Furthermore, the use of negotiation, mediation and courts by people in these communities relative to arbitration by chiefs is increasing. The Government of Ghana needs to strengthen the public sector land institutions and put in place stronger and binding mechanisms for resolving disputes arising from large-scale acquisitions of land to cushion the effect of the weakening confidence in the chieftaincy institution...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>upswing</b> has firmed up in {{all regions}} of Austria. No major region is lagging behind, but in the West the rebound is weaker than in {{previous}} upturns. The stimulus provided by foreign demand has varied by region. Exports to the reform countries of East-Central Europe had a stronger impact <b>on</b> manufacturing than <b>the</b> <b>upswing</b> in West Germany. In contrast to earlier business cycles <b>the</b> <b>upswing</b> in manufacturing in the western provinces does not lead the general recovery. Growth in manufacturing output accelerated in all provinces (with the exception of Carinthia) against the previous quarter. Production is increasing in most branches; an important exception is the apparel industry which finds itself in a structural crisis because of strong competition from low-wage producers. The broad-based recovery has ensured a relatively balanced regional pattern. Summer tourism continues to suffer from structural problems. The decline in overnight stays dampened business activity in Carinthia and in the western provinces, especially in Tyrol. The dry summer impaired the output of hydro-electric power plants, with energy output most affected in the western provinces. The compensation for these losses by increased production by thermal power plants benefited Vienna's economy the most. Vienna's economy deviated from the regional pattern in manufacturing (modest growth) and in tourism (strong expansion in city tourism) as well. The boom in construction lost momentum; the value of construction put in place stagnated in four provinces (Vienna, Tyrol, Styria, Upper Austria). As employment expanded (fourth quarter: + 0. 9 percent change from four quarters earlier), unemployment fell (unemployment rate in the fourth quarter: 6. 8 percent). The regional pattern {{of the labor market}} showed only small variation. In the third quarter 1994, gross value added in four provinces expanded faster than in Austria on average (+ 2. 5 percent, excluding agriculture and forestry). In Burgenland (+ 5. 0 percent) and in Styria (+ 3. 0 percent) the most dynamic sector was manufacturing; in Lower Austria (+ 3. 9 percent) and in Upper Austria (+ 2. 8 percent) <b>the</b> <b>upswing</b> was mainly supported by the expansion in services. Economic activity rose at a less than average rate in Salzburg and Vorarlberg (+ 2. 4 percent each). In Salzburg the mainstay of the recovery was manufacturing and producer-oriented services, in Vorarlberg construction and transportation. The lowest growth rates were recorded in Vienna (1. 9 percent), Carinthia (1. 8 percent), and Tyrol (0. 5 percent). In Vienna, the weakness in manufacturing and producer-oriented services dampened economic activity; in Carinthia and Tyrol the sectors slowing the recovery were tourism and the energy sector.

40|$|Since the mid-nineties, U. S. labor {{productivity}} outgrows its European counterpart {{by a wide}} margin. van Ark et al.

This paper tries to answer the question whether this is indeed the case by quantifying the extent to which the U.

In addition, some observations are offered <b>on</b> whether <b>the</b> recent <b>upswing</b> in productivity growth in the U. S. services sector has cured “Baumol’s Cost Disease. ” 1...|$|R
