Under nonsaturating conditions, DHPase acts on ICRF- 187 4 times faster than ft does on ICRF- 186. However, the single-ring <b>opened</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> products of both ICRF- 187 and ICRF- 186 are not substrates of DHPase.

Of these, monacyclinones A–B (4 – 5) contain the core ring structure of dehydrorabelomycin (2) with the aminodeoxysugar found in frigocyclinone (1). Monacyclinone C (6) is a hydroxylated variant of frigocyclinone (1) and monacyclinone D (7) is a Baeyer Villiger derivative of (6) which also exists as the <b>open</b> chain <b>hydrolysis</b> product monacyclinone E (8). Monacyclinone F (9) contains two unique epoxide rings attached to the angucyclinone moiety and an additional aminodeoxysugar attached through an angular oxygen bond. All structures were confirmed through spectral analyses. Activity against rhabdomycosarcoma cancer cells (SJCRH 30) after 48 h of treatment was observed with frigocyclinone (1; EC 50 = 5. 2 µM), monacyclinone C (6; 160 µM), monacyclinone E (8; 270 µM), and monacyclinone F (9; 0. 73 µM).

40|$|The <b>open</b> forced <b>hydrolysis</b> {{method and}} {{controllable}} silica growth based on bound water to polyvinylpyrrolidone molecules {{have been developed}} for the highly shape (including rhombohedra, semispheres, and rods) selective synthesis, self-assembly, and uniform silica coating (in the unprecedented range of 5 − 200 nm) of hematite nanoparticles. The open system realizes the direct short-range self-assembly of hematite semispheres in their growth process. The bound water method has been extended to coat gold nanoparticles with tunable silica shell and directly assemble the cores into one-dimensional, dimer, and trimer nanostructures during the coating process. The silica coating increases the particle stability and monodispersity even as hematite is modified into ferromagnetic Fe 3 O 4. The hematite@silica core−shell spheres are assembled into long-range ordered structures with considerable photonic bandgap for the first time due to their high monodispersity. By exploiting the hematite antiferromagnetism caused by the superexchange interaction via intervening oxygen ions that are sensitive to hydrogen, a novel hydrogen sensing based on magnetization variations is achieved in the hematite assemblies. Weakening the antiferromagnetism by reducing the hematite size and/or covering the hematite surface by silica coating suppresses the sensitivity to hydrogen, showing that the antiferromagnetic spin variations on the hematite surface are responsible for the gas sensing...|$|R
40|$|Ring-shaped sliding clamps and {{clamp loader}} ATPases are {{essential}} factors for rapid and accurate DNA replication. The clamp ring is opened and resealed at the primer–template junctions by the ATP-fueled clamp loader function. The processivity of the DNA polymerase is conferred by its attachment to the clamp loaded onto the DNA. In eukarya and archaea, the replication factor C (RFC) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) play crucial roles as the clamp loader and the clamp, respectively. Here, we report the electron microscopic structure of an archaeal RFC–PCNA–DNA complex at 12 -Å resolution. This complex exhibits excellent fitting of each atomic structure of RFC, PCNA, and the primed DNA. The PCNA ring retains an open conformation by extensive interactions with RFC, with a distorted spring washer-like conformation.

40|$|Accurate {{replication}} and {{segregation of}} the bacterial genome {{are essential for}} cell cycle progression. We have identified a single amino acid substitution in the Caulobacter Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein that disrupts chromosome segregation and cell division. The E 1076 Q point mutation in the SMC ATPase domain caused a dominant-negative phenotype in which DNA replication was able to proceed, but duplicated parS centromeres, normally found at opposite cell poles, remained at one pole. The cellular positions of other chromosomal loci were in the wild-type order relative to the parS centromere, but chromosomes remained unsegregated {{and appeared to be}} stacked upon one another. Purified SMC-E 1076 Q was deficient in ATP hydrolysis and exhibited abnormally stable binding to DNA. We propose that SMC spuriously links the duplicated chromosome immediately after passage of the replication fork. In wild type cells, ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>opens</b> the SMC dimer, freeing one chromosome to segregate to the opposite pole. The loss of ATP hydrolysis causes the SMC-E 1076 Q dimer to remain bound to both chromosomes, inhibiting segregation...|$|R
40|$|Proline {{metabolism}} is {{an important}} pathway that has relevance in several cellular functions such as redox balance, apoptosis, and cell survival. Results from different groups have indicated that substrate channeling of proline metabolic intermediates may be a critical mechanism. One intermediate is pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate (P 5 C), which upon <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>opens</b> to glutamic semialdehyde (GSA). Recent structural and kinetic evidence indicate substrate channeling of P 5 C/ GSA occurs in the proline catabolic pathway between the proline dehydrogenase and P 5 C dehydrogenase active sites of bifunctional proline utilization A (PutA). Substrate channeling in PutA is proposed to facilitate the hydrolysis of P 5 C to GSA which is unfavorable at physiological pH. The second intermediate, gamma-glutamyl phosphate, {{is part of the}} proline biosynthetic pathway and is extremely labile. Substrate channeling of gamma-glutamyl phosphate is thought to be necessary to protect it from bulk solvent. Because of the unfavorable equilibrium of P 5 C/GSA and the reactivity of gamma-glutamyl phosphate, substrate channeling likely improves the efficiency of proline metabolism. Here, we outline general strategies for testing substrate channeling and review the evidence for channeling in proline metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The Zymomonas mobilis {{genes for}} ethanol {{production}} have been {{integrated into the}} chromosome of Klebsiella oxytoca M 5 A 1. The best of these constructs, strain P 2, produced ethanol efficiently from cellobiose in addition to monomeric sugars. Utilization of cellobiose and cellotriose by this strain eliminated the requirement for external beta-glucosidase and reduced the amount of commercial cellulase needed to ferment Solka Floc SW 40 (primarily crystalline cellulose). The addition of plasmids encoding endoglucanases from Clostridium thermocellum resulted in the intracellular accumulation of thermostable enzymes as coproducts with ethanol during fermentation. The best of these, strain P 2 (pCT 603 T) containing celD, was used to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose to cellobiose and produce ethanol in a two-stage process. Strain P 2 (pCT 603 T) was also tested in combination with commercial cellulases. Pretreatment of Solka Floc SW 40 at 60 degrees C with endoglucanase D substantially reduced the amount of commercial cellulase required to ferment Solka Floc. The stimulatory effect of the endoglucanase D pretreatment may result from the hydrolysis of amorphous regions, exposing additional sites for attack by fungal cellulases. Since endoglucanase D functions {{as part of a}} complex in C. thermocellum, it is possible that this enzyme may complex with fungal enzymes or bind cellulose to produce a more <b>open</b> structure for <b>hydrolysis...</b>|$|R

Serial samples of serum and urine were assayed by microbiological methods, and urine samples collected during the high-dose i. m. regimen were assayed by a high-pressure liquid chromatographic procedure. Mean peak serum levels were 39 and 99 micrograms/ml after the initial i. v. doses and 18 and 39 micrograms/ml after the initial i. m. doses. There {{was no evidence of}} drug accumulation. Mean serum trough levels were 1. 0 and 2. 5 micrograms/ml during the two i. v. regimens and 1. 8 and 3. 8 micrograms/ml during the two i. m. regimens.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP) -gated chloride channel. ATP-induced dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) {{has been shown}} to reflect the channel <b>open</b> state, whereas <b>hydrolysis</b> of ATP is associated with channel closure. Pyrophosphate (PPi), like nonhydrolytic ATP analogues, is known to lock open the CFTR channel for tens of seconds when applied with ATP. Here, we demonstrate that PPi by itself opens the CFTR channel in a Mg 2 +-dependent manner long after ATP is removed from the cytoplasmic side of excised membrane patches. However, the short-lived open state (τ ∼ 1. 5 s) induced by MgPPi suggests that MgPPi alone does not support a stable NBD dimer configuration. Surprisingly, MgPPi elicits long-lasting opening events (τ ∼ 30 s) when administrated shortly after the closure of ATP-opened channels. These results indicate the presence of two different closed states (C 1 and C 2) upon channel closure and a state-dependent effect of MgPPi on CFTR gating. The relative amount of channels entering MgPPi-induced long-open bursts during the ATP washout phase decreases over time, indicating a time-dependent dissipation of the closed state (C 2) that can be locked open by MgPPi. The stability of the C 2 state is enhanced when the channel is initially opened by N 6 -phenylethyl-ATP, a high affinity ATP analogue, but attenuated by W 401 G mutation, which likely weakens ATP binding to NBD 1, suggesting that an ATP molecule remains bound to the NBD 1 site in the C 2 state. Taking advantage of the slow opening rate of Y 1219 G-CFTR, we are able to identify a C 2 -equivalent state (C 2 *), which exists before the channel in the C 1 state is opened by ATP. This closed state responds to MgPPi much more inefficiently than the C 2 state. Finally, we show that MgAMP-PNP exerts its effects on CFTR gating via a similar mechanism as MgPPi. The structural and functional significance of our findings is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{increase}} protein stability by insertion of novel disulfide bonds {{have not always}} been successful. According to the two current models, cross-links enhance stability mainly through denatured state effects. We have investigated the effects of removal and addition of disulfide cross-links, protein flexibility in the vicinity of a cross-link, and disulfide loop size on the stability of Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor-V (CMTI-V; 7 kD) by differential scanning calorimetry. CMTI-V offers the advantage of a large, flexible, and solvent-exposed loop not involved in extensive intra-molecular interactions. We have uncovered a negative correlation between retention time in hydrophobic column chromatography, a measure of protein hydrophobicity, and melting temperature (Tm), an indicator of native state stabilization, for CMTI-V and its variants. In conjunction with the complete set of thermodynamic parameters of denaturation, this has led to the following deductions: (1) In the less stable, disulfide-removed C 3 S/C 48 S (ΔΔGd 50 °C = − 4 kcal/mole; ΔTm = − 22 °C), the native state is destabilized more than the denatured state; this also applies to the less-stable CMTI-V* (ΔΔGd 50 °C = − 3 kcal/mole; ΔTm = − 11 °C), in which the disulfide-containing loop is <b>opened</b> by specific <b>hydrolysis</b> of the Lys 44 -Asp 45 peptide bond; (2) In the less stable, disulfide-inserted E 38 C/W 54 C (ΔΔGd 50 °C = − 1 kcal/mole; ΔTm = + 2 °C), the denatured state is more stabilized than the native state; and (3) In the more stable, disulfide-engineered V 42 C/R 52 C (ΔΔGd 50 °C = + 1 kcal/mole; ΔTm = + 17 °C), the native state is more stabilized than the denatured state. These results show that a cross-link stabilizes both native and denatured states, and differential stabilization of the two states causes either loss or gain in protein stability. Removal of hydrogen bonds in the same flexible region of CMTI-V resulted in less destabilization despite larger changes in the enthalpy and entropy of denaturation. The effect of a cross-link on the denatured state of CMTI-V was estimated directly by means of a four-state thermodynamic cycle consisting of native and denatured states of CMTI-V and CMTI-V*. Overall, the results show that an enthalpy-entropy compensation accompanies disulfide bond effects and protein stabilization is profoundly modulated by altered hydrophobicity of both native and denatured states, altered flexibility near the cross-link, and residual structure in the denatured state...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} for {{industrial}} products is not new. Plants {{have long been}} used for clothes, shelter, paper, construction, adhesives, tools, and medicine. With the exploitation on fossil fuel usage in the early 20 th century and development of petroleum based refinery, the use of biomass for industrial application declined. Since the late 1960 s, the petroleum-based products have widely replaced the use of biomass-based products. However, depletion of fossil fuels, rising oil prices, and growing environmental awareness, push the attention and policy towards a transition from fossil into bio-based products. Bio-based products can also be obtained from protein. The amine group (-NH 2) in protein shows attractive functionality for nitrogen-containing chemicals production. In petroleum based conversion of crude oil into chemicals, co-reagents such as ammonia have to be used, and various process steps are involved. With the amine in protein, various co-reagent introducing process steps can be by-passed. Biomass refinery for protein might not only be necessary for supplying feedstock for the chemical industry, before all, {{it is important to}} meet the world protein demand for food and feed. Chapter 1 illustrates the protein shortage in 2030 that we will encounter with the current uses of protein in the diet of both humans and animals. The worldwide protein production may provide this demand only if we consider the biomass refinery for protein and use the protein product in an effective and efficient way according the specific need of food, feed, and chemical industry.   For this purpose, development in protein extraction technology from various types of biomass is essential. The thesis entitled “Biomass and its potential for protein and amino acids; valorizing agricultural by-products” describes possibilities for using agricultural by-products as protein and or amino acid resources. An overview on alkaline plant protein extraction was first presented, in Chapter 2, including the potential of addition of different types of enzymes. Protein extraction from common resources such as soybean meal and other oilseed meals were reviewed. Also new protein resources, like microalgae, were discussed on the applicability of alkali based methods for protein extraction. Most of the experimental studies opted for less than 100 min and 50 - 60 °C as extraction time and temperature, respectively. A typical biomass to solvent ratio of 1 : 10 was selected in some studies. Alkaline pH was selected over acidic pH, because it is far away from the isoelectric point (IEP). Most proteins have the lowest solubility at their IEP, which commonly occurs at pH 4 - 5. Adding proteases during protein extraction increased protein yield. Two types of extraction methods were experimentally researched in this study; alkaline and combined alkaline and enzymatic. In Chapter 3, alkaline protein extraction method was used to extract protein from 16 types of biomass, mostly agricultural by-products. Aiming to maximise protein extraction yields, a three step extraction was performed at elevated temperatures; 25, 60, and 120 °C. Protein yield was correlated to biomass chemical composition through Partial Least Square (PLS) regression. The results showed that protein extractability depended crucially on the type of biomass used. Protein from cereals and legumes were highly extracted, compared to other biomass. High protein extractability coincides with the biological function of protein as a storage protein, as opposed to functional protein. Protein extraction was furthermore correlated to the composition of the biomass. Especially cellulose and oil hamper extractability of protein, whereas lignin has no significant influence, suggesting that alkaline treatment removed lignin sufficiently. In Chapter 4, the effect of proteolysis during protein extraction was studied. Based on their working pHs, both alkaline and acidic proteases tested. Oilseed meals from soybean, rapeseed, and microalgae were considered as protein resource. Proteases that worked at acidic pH assisted protein extraction; but, still, more proteins were extracted using proteases that work at alkaline pH. This finding is in line with the literatures study from Chapter 2 mentioning that more proteins can be extracted at alkaline pH. Protex 40 XL, Protex P, and Protex 5 L that work at alkaline pH assisted protein extraction, particularly for rapeseed and microalgae meals. To a lesser extent, these proteases also improved protein extraction yield of soybean meal and untreated microalgae. Having shown that proteolysis aids in protein extraction, proteases were also used to solubilise wheat gluten at alkaline pH. Solubilising wheat gluten is one of the bottle necks for wheat gluten application. In this thesis, wheat gluten was used to represent wheat dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). From our perspective, more biomass by-products, such as wheat DDGS derived from ethanol production, will be available, also due to the target to replace 10 % fossil fuel with bio-based fuel in 2050. With high glutamic acid content, wheat gluten provides possibilities to serve as an amino acid resource. Glutamic acid, which currently is microbial produced, has potential as feedstock for bulk chemicals production. Large amounts of cheaper glutamic acid can be made available by enabling its production from biomass by-products, such as wheat DDGS. Several methods for producing glutamic acid from wheat gluten were developed and the results were presented in Chapter 5. We found that a combination of enzymatic and mild acid <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>opens</b> up new possibilities for the industrial production of glutamic acid from biomass. Finally, in Chapter 6, general knowledge obtained from this study is discussed and a perspective on biomass valorization for protein and/or amino acids is presented. It was concluded that biomass, and particularly agricultural residues, are potential resources for protein and/or amino acids. An outlook on protein and/or amino acids production from by-products was also provided in this chapter. For this, economic calculations were provided that focussed on the processing cost. Based on these calculations, overnight alkaline treatment at room temperature was most economical to extract protein from most types of biomass. Residual biomass following protein extraction can be used as animal feed or for energy usage to get to a more integrated biorefinery, thereby reducing protein production cost.    ...|$|R
