5000|$|Pintsch {{achieved}} {{success in}} 1847 with {{the invention of}} a gas meter that would eventually be used worldwide. In 1851, he created a gas lamp that was suitable for use in railroad cars. These lamps were illuminated by Pintsch gas; a long-burning gas that would remain lit during the rough motion of train journeys. Pintsch gas was essentially purified, compressed naphtha that was regulated and reduced to 1/3 <b>ounce</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> of pressure to the burner. Pintsch gas was later replaced by an improved Blau gas or [...] "blue gas" [...] for railroad car usage.|$|R
50|$|Manual lymphatic {{drainage}} (MLD) {{is a type}} of massage {{based on}} preliminary evidence which is hypothesized to encourage the natural drainage of the lymph, which carries waste products away from the tissues back toward the heart. The lymph system depends on intrinsic contractions of the smooth muscle cells in the walls of lymph vessels (peristalsis) and the movement of skeletal muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to lymph nodes and then to the lymph ducts which return lymph to the cardiovascular system. Manual lymph drainage uses a specific amount of pressure (less than 9 <b>ounces</b> <b>per</b> square <b>inch</b> or about 4 kPa) and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow. Clinical studies of MLD conclude that further study of the practice is required before recommending it as an effective health treatment.|$|R

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (and picks <b>per</b> <b>inch)</b> and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|R
