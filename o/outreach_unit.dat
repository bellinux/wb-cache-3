40|$|While {{regional}} innovation systems are, to some extent, an artefact {{of regional}} administration and mimesis, {{there are also}} clear proximity and agglomeration dynamics. A third type of dynamic at play derives from uptake of knowledge production, regional role of universities etc. The advent of strategic science, with its double emphasis on relevance (including local relevance) and global competition, creates pressures on universities which {{want to play a}} regional role as well. The University of Twente, in The Netherlands, is an example. Its evolution shows that the regional function leans heavily on institutional differentiations like <b>outreach</b> <b>units,</b> while strategic science is taken up in new outward looking, problem-solving centres, not necessarily directed towards the region. The immediate moral is that universities can play a role in managing the tension between local (regional) and global, but the tensions will return internally. The general moral is that the changes in knowledge production (whether labeled as strategic science or Mode 2 or whatever) have {{to be taken into account}} in regional innovation systems. This might also help to avoid a short-sighted focus on wealth creation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In {{response}} to the increasing burden of HIV, the Ugandan government has employed different service delivery models since 2004 that aim to reduce costs and remove barriers to accessing HIV care. These models include community-based approaches to delivering antiretroviral therapy (ART) and delegating tasks to lower-level health workers. This study aimed to provide data on annual ART cost per client among three different service delivery models in Uganda. Methods: Costing data for the entire year 2012 were retrospectively collected {{as part of a}} larger task-shifting study conducted in three organizations in Uganda: Kitovu Mobile (KM), the AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) and Uganda Cares (UC). A standard cost data capture tool was developed and used to retrospectively collect cost information regarding antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and non-ARV drugs, ART-related lab tests, personnel and administrative costs. A random sample of four TASO centres (out of 11), four UC clinics (out of 29) and all KM <b>outreach</b> <b>units</b> were selected for the study. Results: Cost varied across sites within each organization as well as across the three organizations. In addition, the number of annual ART visits was more frequent in rural areas and through KM (the community distribution model), which played a major part in the overall annual ART cost. The annual cost per client (in USD) was $ 404 for KM, $ 332 for TASO and $ 257 for UC. These estimates were lower than previous analyses in Uganda or the region compared to data from 2001 to 2009, but comparable with recent estimates using data from 2010 to 2013. ARVs accounted for the majority of the total cost, followed by personnel and operational costs. Conclusions: The study provides updated data on annual cost per ART visit for three service delivery models in Uganda. These data will be vital for in-country budgetary efforts to ensure that universal access to ART, as called for in the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, is achievable. The lower annual ART cost found in this study indicates that we may be able to treat all people with HIV as laid out in the 2015 WHO guidelines. The variation of costs across sites and the three models indicates the potential for efficiency gains...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Outreach {{teaching}} is now {{regarded as a}} desirable component of undergraduate dental teaching programmes in the UK. A purpose-built undergraduate dental outreach-training centre was opened in Cardiff in 2002. The aim {{of this paper is}} to report student perspectives and opinions on their experience at this unit over a 5 -year period. Methods: Final year dental students at Cardiff University were invited to report their comments on the St David's Primary Care Unit at various times during their placement there. Information was recorded for undergraduate students who commenced final year in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 (n = 257). Results: After 1 year, the most common favourable aspects reported by students included the availability of a suitably trained nurse for all procedures (n = 191), ready access to helpful/approachable teaching staff (n = 145), and closeness of learning experience to subsequent practice (n = 122). Many students commented on their growing confidence in their own abilities whilst in the unit. Conclusion: Overwhelmingly, students reported their enthusiasm for training in an <b>outreach</b> teaching <b>unit,</b> preferring it to traditional dental school environments. Inherent in the comments recorded for each student was a sense of growing confidence in their abilities and development of reflective practice. Further work is needed to identify the impact of this form of dental student training on subsequent practices in Vocational Training and independent clinical careers...|$|R

40|$|While the {{merging of}} {{historical}} and anthropological outlooks has been a productive trend in Plains Indian studies, there are pitfalls. For one, the authority inherent in an accurate chronology or lively narrative can mask basic errors in social analysis. Sometimes historians have difficulty in properly employing the terms and principles of social organization so carefully wrought in the neighbor discipline. Readers get an epic infused with mistaken ethnology, resulting in a setback rather than advance in understanding. So it is with Gerald Betty 2 ̆ 7 s Comanche Society. The work attempts to recast the history of Comanche expansion via chapters on kinship, migration, pastoralism, economics, and violence. Each chapter hinges on an ornate retelling of an episode such as the 1786 Comanche-Spanish peace or the 1821 interception of American trader Thomas James. One appreciates Betty 2 ̆ 7 s eye for nuances until the author assembles them to support untenable suppositions, driven by the concept that kinship was the determinative force in all matters Comanche. The imperative was sociobiological, with altruism as well as territoriality and brutality playing a part, notions derived from the largely unpublished corpus of anthropologist Lyle Steadman and other sources. Trouble really starts when the author decides that the Comanches had lineages and clans that shaped organization and <b>outreach.</b> Such <b>units</b> never existed for the Comanches, and the only Native names for them supplied in the text actually refer to political divisions formed from bilateral bands. Elaboration of this false premise coincides with numerous other errors (on page 100, for instance, cultural specialization in regional trade is called a 2 ̆ 2 division of labor, 2 ̆ 2 in {{a departure from the}} term 2 ̆ 7 s meaning fixed since Durkheim), unsupported generalizations (such as the claim on page 119 that 2 ̆ 2 Interpretations of Comanche economics have tended to assume a zero-sum situation in which the Indians lose 2 ̆ 2), and conclusions of dubious value (for example, the statement on page 120 that 2 ̆ 2 Trade is social, whereas hostile behavior is fundamentally antisocial 2 ̆ 2).
