5|$|Britain {{captured}} Acadia from France in Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), but the Treaty of Utrecht left Cape Breton Island in French hands, and did {{not clearly}} demarcate a boundary between New France and the British colonies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast. To protect the crucial passageway of the Saint Lawrence River {{into the heart of}} New France, France built a strong fortress at Louisbourg <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast of Cape Breton Island.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British forces on the North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines {{as he had done}} six years earlier on Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines. It served as part of the British forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels.

5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
