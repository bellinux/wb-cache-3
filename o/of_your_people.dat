If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people</b> who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families {{that had no}} income. Freeman deflected, [...] "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." [...] Kennedy replied, [...] "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [...] here back down there with some <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people...</b> Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?" [...] Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.|$|E

The Dweller urges him to help King Shark, who still bears scars from a previous battle with Aquaman during the recent Crisis. The Dweller, confusing Arthur for Aquaman and calling him his [...] "charge", tells Arthur and King Shark of a prophecy regarding Arthur's future, a prophecy {{which seems to be}} a distorted version of the original Aquaman's history. The Dweller reveals that the original Aquaman was [...] "transformed into one akin to a great and terrible enemy <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people</b> and became the vessel of power strange, ancient and terrible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, {{when the}} Labour Party came into office, Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered an investigation. It was {{performed}} by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The appointment of Stuart-Smith was not without controversy. At a meeting in Liverpool with relatives {{of those involved in}} Hillsborough in October 1997, he flippantly remarked [...] "Have you got a few <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people</b> or are they like the Liverpool fans, turn up at the last minute?" [...] He later apologised for his remark, saying it was not intended to offend. The terms of reference of his inquiry were limited to [...] "new evidence", that is [...] "...evidence which was not available or was not presented to the previous inquires, courts or authorities." [...] Therefore, evidence such as witness statements which had been altered were classed as inadmissible.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{doubling}} {{the scope of}} the 2nd edition, Macfarquhar's encyclopedic vision was finally realized. Recruited by Gleig, several illustrious authorities contributed to this edition, such as Dr. Thomas Thomson, who introduced modern chemical nomenclature in a chart appended to the Chemistry article, and would go on to re-write that article in the 1801 supplement (see below), and John Robison, Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who wrote several well-regarded articles on sciences then called natural philosophy. The third edition established the foundation of the Britannica as an important and definitive reference work for much of the next century. This edition was also enormously profitable, yielding 42,000pounds sterling profit on the sale of roughly 10,000 copies. The 3rd edition began the tradition (continued to this day) of dedicating the Britannica to the reigning British monarch, then King George III; calling him [...] "the Father <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>People,</b> and enlightened Patron of Arts, Sciences and Literature", Gleig wished ...|$|E

[...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paulo Portas’ {{name has}} come up in {{connection}} with questionable deals conducted by subsidiaries of Portugal’s disgraced Espírito Santo Group (ESG) that imploded in 2014 defrauding creditors, shareholders, and potentially the Portuguese banking system and Treasury. The first such instance was in 2004, when the Portuguese police intercepted {{a phone call from}} a top financial officer of Portas’ CDS-PP party to an ESG manager reminding him that [...] "we (presumably CDS-PP) put in the hands <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people</b> (presumably ESG) more than 400 million euros in the last three weeks" [...] referring to unspecified business deals that likely included ESG's subsidiaries ESAF and ESCOM involved in, respectively, the [...] "Portucale" [...] and the [...] "submarines" [...] cases (see above). [...] Subsequently, in 2013, while he was minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulo Portas personally promoted an ill-fated luxury resort development (Herdade da Comporta) by Rioforte Investments SA, an ESG subsidiary that triggered the ESG’s group’s collapse dragging with it Portugal's telecommunication's giant Portugal Telecom that was heavily exposed to Rioforte unsecured debt. In 2015, it also emerged that in a last-ditch effort to save GES from bankruptcy, its chairman-Ricardo Salgado-had contacted Paulo Portas in 2014 in a non-successful attempt to obtain emergency financing with the support of the government in which Portas was the Deputy Prime-Minister. In a subsequent parliamentary inquiry, Paulo Portas admitted meeting with Ricardo Salgado but denied interceding on his behalf at Cabinet level or even knowing in advance of the decision to resolve Banco Espírito Santo, which had been until then the flagship of the ESG group.|$|E

Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered. A crowd of warriors rushed to his rescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of [...] "Hurry up with them! Kill them all!" [...] I saw American Horse walk out of the agent's office and calmly face the excited mob. [...] "What are you going to do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Stop, men, stop and think before you act! Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an instant. He went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, but what will you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>people.</b> Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling.
