40|$|The {{usual way}} of {{installing}} {{a new version}} of a software system is to shut down the running program and then install the new version. This necessitates a sometimes unacceptable delay during which service is denied to the users of the software. An <b>on-line</b> <b>software</b> replacement system replaces parts of the software while it is in execution, thus eliminating the shutdown. While a number of implementations of on-line version change systems have been described in the literature, little investigation has been done on its theoretical aspects. In this paper, we describe a formal framework for studying <b>on-line</b> <b>software</b> version change.

40|$|The {{usual way}} of {{installing}} {{a new version}} of a software is to shut down the running program and then installing the new version. This necessitates a delay during which service is denied to the users of the software, and has the effect of reducing the overall availability of the system. An <b>on-line</b> <b>software</b> replacement system replaces parts of the software while it is in execution, thereby eliminating shutdown of the software and increasing the availability of the system. In this paper, we describe an approach for performing on-line version change and a system for <b>on-line</b> <b>software</b> version change that implements that approach. In the proposed method, for performing an on-line change, the system creates a new process with the new version of the software, and monitors the execution of the old version.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{problems associated}} with the control of highly damped flexible structures are outlined. The practical problems include: high performance; assembly in space, configuration changes; <b>on-line</b> controller <b>software</b> design; and lack of test data. Underlying all of these problems is the central problem of modeling errors. To justify the expense of a space structure, the performance requirements will necessarily be very severe. On the other hand, the absence of economical tests precludes the availability of reliable data before flight. A design algorithm is offered which: (1) provides damping for a larger number of modes than the optimal attitude controller controls; (2) coordinates the rate of feedback design with the attitude control design by use of a similar cost function; and (3) provides model reduction and controller reduction decisions which are systematically connected to the mathematical statement of the control objectives and the disturbance models...|$|R
