30|$|Although the {{background}} of the horses is not completely known, it can be assumed that the animals came from different areas of Germany. Since no fattening farms exist in Germany (Gudehus 2006), the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> slaughtered horses largely differ. In particular, age and field of use (e.g. sports or leisure riding, reproduction) of the horses vary (Gudehus 2006). The horses chosen for the present investigation might therefore represent the situation regarding the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> meat <b>producing</b> horses in Germany. However, the observed individual variations in the element concentrations in the equine liver and kidneys indicate differences in the exposure of the horses to environmental contaminants and dietary mineral supply. With regard to the use of equine by-products in the food chain, variations in the uptake of specific environmental contaminants and trace elements by the ingestion of equine organs can be assumed and should be considered for risk assessment in human and animal nutrition.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To measure {{changes in}} {{knowledge}} of and attitudes towards vegetables and fruits associated {{with the introduction of}} a school-based food garden Methods: A school-based community food garden was installed in a suburban state primary school in a low socioeconomic area of Brisbane, Australia. The ability to identify a series of vegetables and fruits, and determinant factors for vegetable and fruit consumption (family environment, neophobia, peer influence, preferences, nutritional awareness, perception of intake) were measured. This 12 -month intervention trial used an historical control design (control n= 132, intervention n= 120). Data were collected from all students in grades 4 to 7 (ie. ages 8 to 12 years), using class-based, self administered questionnaires requiring one-word answers and 3 -point Likert style responses. Frequency distributions for each question were generated and chi-squared analyses were used to determine statistical significance. Exploratory factor analysis was used to detect major trends in data. Results: Subjects showed enhanced ability to identify individual vegetables and fruits (p< 0. 05), greater attention to <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>produce</b> (garden-grown and fresh) (p< 0. 001), changes to perceived consumption of vegetables and fruits (p< 0. 001), and enhanced confidence in preparing fruit and vegetable snacks (p< 0. 05). However, a decreased interest in trying new fruits was detected post-intervention (p< 0. 001).

We aim at defining {{criteria for the}} country-of-origin marking COOL for processed foods and figure out the effect of COOL on international trade. We conduct qualitative and systematic research using the Delphi method. The panel of experts in food labelling and food policy was composed of 19 members in 13 countries.

The essential consensus is that multiple countries <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> marking can give accurate information about the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> food <b>produced</b> by two or more countries, avoiding misinformation for consumers. This research provides valuable insights for the formulation of COOL policy in various countries. The main limitation {{is due to the}} absence of the view of producer associations.|$|R
40|$|The Lower Volga region {{territory}} plays a {{large part}} in studying the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> economy. It is particularly important to determine {{the time of this}} process commencement. The researchers assumed the coexistence of the late Neolithic and Early Eneolithic monuments in this area. On that basis they highlighted the Neo-Eneolithic period. The researchers dated it {{to the middle of the}} 5 millennium BC. They associated this period and the emergence <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> economy at the territory under discussion. The weak point of this hypothesis was a small number of radiocarbon dates on this issue. Obtained after 2007, the radiocarbon dates on the Neolithic and Eneolithic monuments in the Lower Volga region demonstrate a 500 -year chronological gap between them. That is why the hypothesis of the Neo-Eneolithic period is not confirmed. At the same time there is a reason to believe that the Late Neolithic and the Caspian Sea region culture coexisted during 5800 - 5500 BC. However, the referring of the Caspian Sea region culture to the Eneolithic suffers from the lack of evidence that its carriers were familiar with metal. There is also no evidence that they had cattle breeding. The situation changed after studying the Oroshaemoye I archaeological site in the Lower Volga region in 2014 - 2015. Cultural layer with materials from only the Caspian Sea region culture was found there. This increases the significance of the monument. The bones of domestic sheep and goats were found in this cultural layer. This is the first significant evidence <b>of</b> <b>producing</b> economy existing among the population of the Lower Volga region. AMS radiocarbon dates 4800 and 4700 BC were obtained from domestic sheep bones from this site. Thus, it is possible to make a reasoned conclusion that producing economy had being formed in the Lower Volga region among the carriers of the Caspian Sea region culture. This process can be reliably dated to the beginning of the 5 millennium BC...|$|R
