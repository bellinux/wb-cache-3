Some of these oaks were noble ones indeed. How I wish one stood in <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> at home....I measured one [...] with wide spreading and cragged branches, that was 26.5 feet in circumference. [...] Another had a diameter of over six feet, and the branches spread over 75 feet each way. I lay beneath its shade a little while before going on." ...|$|E

60|$|The Shy Man {{came into}} <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> one {{afternoon}} in April, while I was sleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed from Fred, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didn't take any notice. Mother {{is what they call}} a good watch-dog, and she growls at everybody except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would get up and bark my head off, but not now. Life's too short to bark at everybody who comes into <b>our</b> <b>yard.</b> It is behind the public-house, and they keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming and going.|$|E

60|$|Any {{one might}} be certain that the Englishman's glasses were {{levelled}} on us the whole time. Some address was used, therefore, in managing to get <b>our</b> <b>yards</b> in without showing {{the people at the}} braces. This was done by keeping off first, and then by leading the ropes as far forward as possible, and causing the men to haul on them, seated on deck. In this manner we got <b>our</b> <b>yards</b> nearly square, or as much in as our new course required, when we sent hands aloft, forward, to get out the lee booms. But we reckoned without our host. John Bull was not to be caught in that way. The hands were hardly in the lee fore rigging, before I saw the fifty falling off to <b>our</b> course, her <b>yards</b> squared, and signs aboard her that she had larboard studding sails as well as ourselves. The change of course had one good effect, however: it brought our pursuer so far on our quarter, that, standing at the capstan, I saw him through the mizen rigging. This took the Dawn completely from under the Leander's broadside, leaving us exposed to merely four or five of her forward guns, should she see fit to use them. Whether the English were reluctant to resort to such very decided means of annoyance, so completely within the American waters, as we were clearly getting to be, or whether they had so much confidence in their speed, as to feel no necessity for firing, I never knew; but they did not have any further recourse to shot.|$|R

The point of this essay is that different groups of trees ought to be managed in one of four ways – as crops, as natural habitat, as an awe-inspiring heritage, {{as in the case of}} national parks, and as dear friends in <b>our</b> <b>yards</b> and along <b>our</b> boulevards...|$|R

60|$|When I came on deck {{the next}} morning <b>our</b> <b>yards</b> were a-drip with a clammy fog, and under it the sea was roughed by a {{southwest}} breeze. We were standing to the northward before it. I remember reflecting as I paused in the gangway that the day was Thursday, September the 23d, {{and that we were}} near two months out of Groix with this tub of an Indiaman. In all that time we had not so much as got a whiff of an English frigate, though we had almost put a belt around the British Isles. Then straining my eyes through the mist, I made out two white blurs of sails on our starboard beam.|$|R

What else could I ha' done? I knowed what he'd need most after a week's such work. I'm a shipbuilder, little maid.|$|E
60|$|We {{started in}} the late afternoon. We throbbed out of <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> above Hammersmith Bridge, fussed about for a moment, and headed down stream. We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach, past Fulham and Hurlingham, past the long {{stretches}} of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea, round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge, and Westminster opened before us. We cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the Parliament houses, and the flag was flying and Parliament was sitting.|$|E
60|$|From {{this spot}} {{we had seen}} the wild prairies disappear. On every hand wheat and corn and clover had taken {{the place of the}} wild oat, the hazelbush and the rose. Our house, a commonplace frame cabin, took on grace. Here Hattie had died. <b>Our</b> <b>yard</b> was ugly, but there Jessie's small feet had worn a slender path. Each of our lives was knit into these hedges and rooted in these fields and yet, {{notwithstanding}} all this, in response to some powerful yearning call, my father was about to set out for the fifth time into the still more remote and untrodden west. Small wonder that my mother sat with bowed head and tear-blinded eyes, while these good and faithful friends crowded around her to say good-bye.|$|E
60|$|In {{two hours}} {{afterwards}} we saw our game standing {{in for the}} bay with all the sail she could make, and she came innocently into our very mouths, for we lay still till we saw her almost within gunshot, when, our foremost gears being stretched fore and aft, we first ran up <b>our</b> <b>yards,</b> and then hauled home the topsail sheets, the rope-yarns that furled them giving way of themselves; the sails were set in a few minutes; {{at the same time}} slipping our cable, we came upon her before she could get under way upon the other tack.

60|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for their action, these birds that you {{discover}} in July are rare, incomprehensible individuals. The bulk of the birds disappear, and you cannot find them. Whether they scatter widely to dense hiding-places and by sitting close escape discovery, or whether, {{like some of the}} snipe, they make a short northern migration in the molting season in search of solitude and a change of food, is yet to be discovered. For it is astonishing how very little we know of a bird that nests in our cow pasture and that often visits <b>our</b> <b>yards</b> and lawns nightly, but whose acquaintance we make only when he is dead and served as a delicious morsel, hot on toast, on our dining-tables.|$|R
60|$|Great was our inward {{satisfaction}} {{when the}} cow, our OWN cow, walked slowly and solemnly into <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> {{and began to}} crop the clover on our little lawn. Pomona and I gently drove her to the barn, while Euphemia endeavored to quiet the violent demonstrations of the dog (fortunately chained) by assuring him that this was OUR cow {{and that she was}} to live here, and that he was {{to take care of her}} and never bark at her. All this and much more, delivered in the earnest and confidential tone in which ladies talk to infants and dumb animals, made the dog think that he was to be let loose to kill the cow, and he bounded and leaped with delight, tugging at his chain so violently that Euphemia became a little frightened and left him. This dog had been named Lord Edward, at the earnest solicitation of Pomona, and he was becoming somewhat reconciled to his life with us. He allowed me to unchain him at night and I could generally chain him up in the morning without trouble if I had a good big plate of food with which to tempt him into the shed.|$|E
60|$|I cannot say at what times I {{read these}} books, {{but they must}} have been odd times, for life was very full of play then, and was already {{beginning}} to be troubled with work. As I have said, I was to and fro between the schoolhouse and the printing-office so much that when I tired of the one I must have been very promptly given my choice of the other. The reading, however, somehow went on pretty constantly, and no doubt my love for it won me a chance for it. There were some famous cherry-trees in <b>our</b> <b>yard,</b> which, as I look back at them, seem to have been in flower or fruit the year round; and in one of them there was a level branch where a boy could sit with a book till his dangling legs went to sleep, or till some idler or busier boy came to the gate and called him down to play marbles or go swimming. When this happened the ancient world was rolled up like a scroll, and put away until the next day, with all its orators and conspirators, its nymphs and satyrs, gods and demigods; though sometimes they escaped at night and got into the boy's dreams.|$|E
6000|$|If aught from fearful dreams may be divined, [...] They signify a cock of {{dunghill}} kind. [...] All dreams, as in old Galen I have read, [...] 140 [...] Are from repletion and complexion bred; [...] From rising fumes of indigested food, [...] And noxious humours that infect the blood: [...] And sure, my lord, if I {{can read}} aright, [...] These foolish fancies {{you have had}} to-night [...] Are certain symptoms (in the canting style) [...] Of boiling choler, and abounding bile; [...] This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats, [...] Engenders all these visionary thoughts. [...] When choler overflows, then dreams are bred [...] 150 [...] Of flames, and all the family of red; [...] Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, [...] For humours are distinguish'd by their hue. [...] From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, [...] And wasps and hornets with their double wings. [...] Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, [...] Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. [...] In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound; [...] With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd. [...] More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, [...] 160 [...] The dominating humour makes the dream. [...] Cato was in his time accounted wise, [...] And he condemns them all for empty lies.

[...] I should be loath to lay you on a bier; [...] And though there lives no pothecary near, [...] I dare for once prescribe for your disease, [...] And save long bills, and a damn'd doctor's fees. [...] 170 [...] Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know, [...] And both at hand (for in <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> they grow), [...] On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly [...] Of yellow choler, and of melancholy: [...] You must both purge, and vomit; but obey, [...] And {{for the love of}} heaven make no delay. [...] Since hot and dry in your complexion join, [...] Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; [...] For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, [...] If then he finds your body in a flame, [...] 180 [...] Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, [...] A tertian ague is at least your lot. [...] Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!) [...] May bring your youth to some untimely end: [...] And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, [...] A day or two before your laxative, [...] Take just three worms, nor under nor above, [...] Because the gods unequal numbers love, [...] These digestives prepare you for your purge; [...] Of fumetory, centaury, and spurge, [...] 190 [...] And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,-- [...] All which within <b>our</b> <b>yard</b> or garden grow.
