5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Psychology,</b> Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gender {{stereotyping}} plays a big role in influencing women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Psychology,</b> a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The interplay <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> {{relationships}} is as fascinating {{as it is}} complex and it pertains to {{a wide array of}} largely separate research domains. Here, we present an integrative and unifiedframeworkfor analysing the complex dynamics <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> relationships (PERSOC). Basic principles and general processes on the individual and dyadic level are outlined to show how <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> relationships infiuence each other and develop over time. PERSOC stresses the importance of <b>social</b> behaviours <b>and</b> interpersonal perceptions as mediating processes organized in social interaction units. The framework can be applied to diverse social relationships such as first encounters, short-term acquaintances, friendships, relationships between working group members, educational or therapeutic settings, romantic relatiollships and family relationships. It has important consequences for how we conceptualize, understand, <b>and</b> investigate <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> relationships. Key words: personality; social relationships; actual behaviour; interpersonal perception; social relations model; mediating processes; development Human beings are characterized as social animals possessing a fundamental need to belong to others (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the topic of school class climate and its {{enhancement}} by the methods <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> education in a concrete class where the author is working as a teacher. The theoretical part is dedicated to the class climate and its characteristics. It describes what influences, by which methods it can be investigated and what can it be influenced by. In the practical part the author uses the methods of the teacher's active research to investigate the climate in her own class and also self-reflexively examines herself from the view of the beginning teacher. During the time period of one school year continually monitors the climate in her class and states the most effective ways towards improvement. The results of the research show that the methods <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> education have an influence to the class climate if they are used in a natural and casual manner. KEY WORDS: Class climate, teacher's active research, beginning teacher, social skills, self - reflection, begin together, <b>personality</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> education, cooperation, relations, pre - puberty, problematic pupil, method...|$|R
