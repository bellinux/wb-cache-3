[...] "Naturally, he immediately became an example for young national composers and a hero in Armenia," [...] suggests Maya Pritsker. Khachaturian's influence can be traced in nearly all trends of Armenian classical music traditions (symphonic and chamber), including on Arno Babajanian, a significant Armenian composer of the late Soviet period. His unique symphonic interpretation has influenced Edvard Mirzoyan, Konstantin Orbelyan and others. Khachaturian is credited for bringing Armenian music recognized worldwide. Poet Hamo Sahyan said about Khachaturian: [...] "He became the big denial of our myth of smallness, [...] became the symbol of measuring <b>our</b> <b>small</b> people with the great ones... became our certificate of civilization." ...|$|E

It must have happened thirty-five times every night. Foreigners came from all parts of Europe to see it". [...] At the top of the building, adjoining the conservatory, was the Queen's Small Hall, seating 500, for recitals, chamber-music concerts and other small-scale presentations. In July 1894, Bernard Shaw described it as [...] "cigar-shaped with windows in the ceiling, and reminiscent of a ship's saloon … now much the most comfortable of <b>our</b> <b>small</b> concert rooms".

In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single [...] "We Are the World" [...] with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. The single {{became one of the}} best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief.

500|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became No.32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. On 11February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on Gasmata harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World WarII described as [...] "the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the New Guinea campaign". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the rear hatch while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making {{his way to a}} Coastwatcher post and returning to Port Moresby in a schooner, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7April, Lerew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for [...] "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the Chief of the Air Staff to commend Lerew's squadron for the [...] "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to <b>our</b> <b>small</b> numbers and general condition".|$|E
500|$|Western {{intelligence}} agencies {{believed that the}} revolution had been organised by communists supplied with weapons by the Warsaw Pact countries. This suspicion was strengthened by the appointment of Babu as Minister for External Affairs and Abdullah Kassim Hanga as Prime Minister, both known leftists with possible communist ties. Britain believed that these two were close associates of Oscar Kambona, the Foreign Affairs Minister of Tanganyika, and that {{former members of the}} Tanganyika Rifles had been made available to assist with the revolution. Some members of the Umma Party wore Cuban military fatigues and beards in the style of Fidel Castro, which was taken as an indication of Cuban support for the revolution. However this practice was started by those members who had staffed a ZNP branch office in Cuba and it became a common means of dress amongst opposition party members {{in the months leading up}} to the revolution. The new Zanzibar government's recognition of the German Democratic Republic (the first African government to do so), and of North Korea, was further evidence to the Western Powers that Zanzibar was aligning itself closely with the communist bloc. Just six days after the revolution the New York Times stated that Zanzibar was [...] "on the verge of becoming the Cuba of Africa", but on 26 January denied that there was active communist involvement. Zanzibar continued to receive support from communist countries and by February was known to be receiving advisers from USSR, East Germany and China. Cuba also lent its support with Che Guevara stating on 15 August that [...] "Zanzibar is our friend and we gave them <b>our</b> <b>small</b> bit of assistance, our fraternal assistance, our revolutionary assistance at the moment when it was necessary" [...] but denying there were Cuban troops present during the revolution. At the same time, western influence was diminishing and by July 1964 just one Briton, a dentist, remained in the employ of the Zanzibari government. It has been alleged that Israeli spymaster David Kimche was a backer of the revolution with Kimche in Zanzibar on the day of the Revolution.|$|E
