5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>screen</b> the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears {{did not show up}} on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E

500|$|Emma Hanna, in {{her book}} The Great War <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Screen,</b> has noted that some {{contemporary}} reviewers felt {{the topic of the}} First World War to be inappropriate for a comedy series, with one newspaper critic uncertain of the writers' motives: [...] "is [...] justified in using tragic situations as a springboard for comedy merely for entertainment value?". Ben Elton's uncle, the historian Geoffrey Elton, [...] "was at first most unhappy at what he considered to be an insulting portrayal of the army", although it is worth noting [...] "he later took the view that the satire was drawn with great respect".|$|E

She felt that he should [...] "be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were [...] "really too slow for television".|$|E
500|$|In 1964 Richardson was {{the voice}} of General Haig in the twenty-six-part BBC {{documentary}} series The Great War. In 1967 he played Lord Emsworth on BBC television in dramatisations of PGWodehouse's Blandings Castle stories, with his wife playing Emsworth's bossy sister Constance, and Stanley Holloway as the butler, Beach. He was nervous about acting in a television series: [...] "I'm sixty-four and that's a bit old to be taking on a new medium." [...] The performances divided critical opinion. The Times thought the stars [...] "a sheer delight... situation comedy is joy in their hands". The reviewers in The Guardian and The Observer thought the three too theatrical to be effective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>screen.</b> [...] For television he recorded studio versions of two plays in which he had appeared on stage: Johnson Over Jordan (1965) and Twelfth Night (1968).|$|E

[...] The segment, which was described as [...] "eerie," [...] was filmed four months before his own death. In his last of many collaborations with producer Roger Corman, Carradine {{appeared in}} the Syfy Channels science fiction monster movie Dinocroc Vs. Supergator, over a year after he died.

Slide to Play Eaves was also troubled by the controls, and recommended the iPad version for the extra screen space. Pocket Gamer Slater {{said it was too}} easy to clear the board with three-letter words, and thus that the design execution was not as robust as the concept, never being [...] "more {{than the sum of its}} strange combination of parts". While TouchArcade Troy Woodfield called the gameplay [...] "not ... totally original" [...] in how it combines three common game ideas, he still found the combination [...] "a stroke of genius", and highly recommended the game as [...] "a breath of fresh air".

VanDerWerff also wrote that the nods to the pilot episode helped to show how far the series had evolved in seven years. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Despite lamenting the loss of Fox Mulder, he noted that [...] "the truth is The X-Files has been a show like no other and 'Requiem' proved once again there truly {{is a place for}} magic and beauty and love <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>screen</b> and I am delighted to have witnessed it for seven seasons now."

500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>screen</b> that fit that character better than {{if we had to}} water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that the character had been written out of Grey's Anatomy, Mary Macnamara wrote a critical LA Times editorial on the decision. She deemed Smith's firing: [...] "a grim reminder that certain prejudices are still ascendant in television", writing that [...] "most gay characters are allowed to have sex on network television {{only if they are}} part of a single-episode story line, and all actively sexual lesbian characters must be sylphlike, gorgeous and preferably under 30." [...] She went on to assess that: [...] "Smith probably got the boot not because her character wasn't interesting enough or sympathetic enough but because she, especially when paired with Ramirez, just didn't fit the visual template of [...] "Grey's" [...] or indeed, of most of network television. She is a character actress, not a tabloid star. In other words, and they are words I deeply regret, Ramirez, with all her lipglossed lusciousness, may be beautiful enough to be bi, but Smith is not beautiful enough to be gay. At least not on network TV. Some ground, it would appear, is too calcified to be broken." [...] After Ellen's Dorothy Snarker was similarly critical of the decision, explaining that: [...] "Smith's dismissal means the loss of American broadcast TV's only lesbian/bisexual couple in primetime. It was also the first significant gay relationship portrayed on the hit ABC series. The handful of remaining lesbian/bisexual relationships on TV are on cable, premium channels and daytime television." [...] Detailing the decision to also change a new character's orientation from bisexual to heterosexual, Snarker added: [...] "Besides striking a serious blow for queer women's visibility <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>screen,</b> the moves seem to signal a significant setback in the industry's acceptance of mainstream gay and lesbian storylines." [...] She concluded that: [...] "While Callie had fleeting moments of gay panic where she slept with friend and fellow surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the interaction between the two women was both organic and romantic. Callie and Erica's relationship stood out as one of the few bright spots for lesbian and bisexual characters on primetime TV. Now it seems all we’re left with is taillights." ...|$|E
