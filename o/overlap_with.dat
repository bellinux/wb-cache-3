5|$|NY43 was {{truncated}} on {{its western}} {{end to the}} junction of 3rd Avenue and Broadway in downtown Rensselaer in the early 1970s, eliminating the <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> US9 and US20 through Albany. Its former routing from Schoharie to Albany was renumbered to NY443. NY43 remained on 3rd Avenue up to the late 1990s when it was rerouted to follow a new highway to I-90 exit8 west of Defreestville. The realignment eliminated the <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> US4 and also took NY43 outside of the Rensselaer city limits {{for the first time}} since being extended across the Hudson River in 1930. The former alignment of NY43 along 3rd Avenue from Broadway to Barracks Road became part of NY151; the remainder was designated NY915E, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|NY9N was {{extended}} south to Lake George in March1936, supplanting both NY47 and NY195 {{in an effort}} to aid tourists. From Westport to Hague, NY9N overlapped with NY22 (from Westport to Ticonderoga) and NY8 (from Crown Point to Hague). The route {{was extended}} once more in November1953 to its current southern terminus in Saratoga Springs, replacing NY9K and creating a short <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> US9 through Lake George village in the process. The <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> NY8 was eliminated in the mid-1960s when that route was truncated to end at its junction with NY9N in Hague.|$|E

5|$|According to {{estimates}} {{made by the}} New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in 2009, NY73 serves an average of 1,950 vehicles per day from US9 to {{the east end of}} the NY9N overlap in Keene. The <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> NY9N accumulated an average of 4,360 vehicles, with the stretch up to the control station at NY913Q having a less amount of traffic. After NY913Q, the average increases, peaking at 4,810 vehicles at NY86 in Lake Placid.|$|E

It became part of a realigned US9 when it was {{completed}} by 1967. The former surface routing of US9 along Albany Post Road between Croton-on-Hudson and Buchanan became a northward extension of NY9A, which reached the old alignment by way of an <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> US9 from {{the north end of}} the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, the New York State Department of Transportation assumed {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} the Watertown Bypass. The entirety of the new state highway, including the portion already part of NY26, was initially designated as NY181. It was renumbered to NY342 , eliminating potential confusion between NY181 and the nearby I-81. NY342 was also rerouted to bypass Black River to the west around this time. The <b>overlap</b> <b>with</b> NY26 was eliminated in the mid-1970s when NY26 was truncated to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} NY210 between NY210 and the Rockland County line was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Orange County.
