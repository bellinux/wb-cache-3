To investigate this hypothesis, 28 undergraduate students distributed in four groups were exposed to a matching-to-sample procedure to establish conditional relations between stimuli {{and the emergence of}} five equivalence classes with five stimuli each. The procedure for each group differed by the number <b>of</b> <b>reversed</b> baseline relations (one, two, three or four) followed by a new equivalence test to evaluate the possible {{reorganization of}} the classes.

30|$|Proof. The way {{of proving}} of Theorem 4 {{is similar to}} Theorem 3. By the reverse Hö lder's {{inequality}} [9], we have the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (10) and (14). It is easy to obtain the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (13). In view <b>of</b> the <b>reverses</b> <b>of</b> (13) and (14), we obtain the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (12). On the other hand, suppose that the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (12) is valid. Setting the same g(y) as theorem 3, by the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (10), we have J > 0. If J = ∞, then the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (13) is obvious value; if J < ∞, then by the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (12), we obtain the <b>reverses</b> <b>of</b> (15) and (16). Hence, we have the <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (13), which {{is equivalent to the}} <b>reverse</b> <b>of</b> (12).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E

At the age of 19, he opened the bowling {{following}} an injury to the Baroda left-armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test. In a high scoring match, he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over. He scored one in his only innings as India took a four-wicket victory. He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer, but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test. On another flat pitch, Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> swing bowling.

5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
5|$|The coinage of Coenwulf {{follows the}} broad silver penny format {{established}} under Offa and his contemporaries. His very first coins {{are very similar}} to the heavy coinage of Offa's last three years, and since the mints at Canterbury and in East Anglia were under the control of Eadbert Praen and Eadwald respectively, these earliest pennies must be the product of the London mint. Before 798 the new tribrach type appeared, with a design consisting of three radial lines meeting at the centre. The tribrach design was introduced initially at London alone but soon spread to Canterbury after it was reconquered from the rebels. It was not struck in East Anglia, but there are tribrach pennies in the name of Cuthred, sub-king of Kent. Around 805 a new portrait coinage was introduced to all three of the southern mints. After around 810 a range <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> designs was introduced, though several were common to many or all of the moneyers. From this date there is also evidence of a new mint, at Rochester in Kent.|$|E

25|$|Pioneers and notable {{practitioners}} <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> swing {{have mostly}} been Pakistani fast bowlers. In {{the early days}} <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve {{the conditions of the}} ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan, reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan, who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. Bowlers tend to disguise the direction <b>of</b> <b>reverse</b> swing by running up starting with the opposite hand before switching hands and covering the ball {{for as long as possible}} before release. Neil Wagner utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.|$|E
