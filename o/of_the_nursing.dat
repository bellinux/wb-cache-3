5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> {{practitioner}} in psychiatric/mental health nursing: exploring consumer satisfaction There is {{a substantial}} body of literature pertaining to <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner. Research directed towards consumer satisfaction suggests that the care provided by nurse practitioners is perceived as at least equal to that provided by a medical practitioner. How-ever, there is a paucity <b>of</b> literature examining <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner role in the psychiatric/ mental health field. An evaluation of a Nurse Practitioner demonstration model has recently been undertaken in the Crisis, Assessment and Treatment Team in Victoria, Australia. This article presents <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> a qualitative, exploratory study. Individual {{interviews were conducted with}} consumers (n 7) who had received care and treatment provided by <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner candidate. Data analysis revealed two main themes: <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ser-vice provided, and <b>the</b> unique role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse.</b> <b>The</b> findings supported the available liter-ature in articulating <b>the</b> specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioner role that are favourably perceived by consumers of services.

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimerâs in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> homes.|$|E
25|$|The {{advanced}} practice nursing role {{began to}} take shape in the mid-20th century United States. Nurse anesthetists and nurse midwives were established in the 1940s, followed by psychiatric nursing in 1954. The present day concept of the APRN as a primary care provider was created in the mid-1960s, spurred on by a national shortage of medical doctors. The first formal graduate certificate program for nurse practitioners was created by Henry Silver, a physician, and Loretta Ford, a nurse, in 1965, with a vision to help balance rising healthcare costs, increase the number of healthcare providers, and correct the inefficient distribution of health resources. In 1971, The U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, made a formal recommendation in expanding the scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> practice and qualifying {{them to be able to}} serve as primary care providers. During the mid 1970s to early 1980s, the completion of a master's degree became required in order to become a certified nurse practitioner. In 2012, discussions have risen between accreditation agencies, national certifying bodies, and state boards of nursing about the possibility of making the DNP as the new minimum of education for NP certification and licensure by 2015.|$|E
