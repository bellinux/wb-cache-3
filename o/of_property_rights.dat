5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> can help here.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection <b>of</b> <b>property</b> <b>rights.</b> Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to examine the}} implications <b>of</b> Intellectual <b>Property</b> <b>Rights</b> on economic benefit gains. An owner <b>of</b> Intellectual <b>Property</b> <b>Rights</b> as a creative subject must get a guarantee of law protection {{on his or her}} work. The result shows that the form of law protection <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> is that the owner <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> in performing his or her rights must be protected by law. The economic rights owned by the owner will gain economic benefits if it is performed. The rights include rights to use, to produce, to publish, to copy, to import, to export and to give license (permit) to another party that is intended to make use <b>of</b> the intellectual <b>property.</b> In a condition of law violation, the Law <b>of</b> Intellectual <b>Property</b> <b>Rights</b> as a preventive effort will give a right to an owner <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> to sue on civil, criminal, or administrative law. The sanctions on the law breaker are also already written in each law <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> that includes copy right, brand right, patent right, graphic design right, and integrated circuit lay-out right. The reason why an owner does not automatically gain economic benefits of his or her work is because he or she does not use the economic rights that he or she has. Some matters causing it are high enough cost of production, difficult licence, and hard competition. The law protection and economic benefits are two essentials <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights.</b> An owner <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> is a creative subject that should have those two matters...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} enhance {{our understanding of}} the nature and evolution <b>of</b> China’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime over the past thirty years of market economy reforms. I ask and answer three core interrelated questions about the country’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> rules governing the ownership, use, control, transfer and profit from property (e. g. land, labour, capital, fixed assets, techology and ideas). These questions are: (i) What is the nature <b>of</b> China’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime? (ii) Why has this institutionally ambiguous <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime persisted despite predictions for convergence with global capitalist norms <b>of</b> private <b>property</b> <b>rights?</b> (iii) How has this ambiguous <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime evolved in way that permits the relative social order necessary to attain sustained economic growth? In answer to the three research questions, my central thesis advances a two-pronged argument. First, I contend that the pivotal defining feature <b>of</b> China’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime is its institutional ambiguity. Second, I build a preliminary pre-theoretical model called “Negotiated Ambiguity” to argue that ambiguity is also a useful concept to explicate the processes of evolutionary changes. Essentially, if we take ambiguity seriously as an institutional feature, we can then understand the dynamic evolution <b>of</b> the country’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime as the product of the continuous processes of negotiations amongst political and economic actors over the legitimate meanings and distributional outcomes <b>of</b> the ambiguous <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> rules. Mediating these negotiations is the Chinese central state (government), whose active agency in the constitution <b>of</b> the ambiguous <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> regime is often downplayed by the extant literature on <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> where local states (governments) have decision-making authority. The proposed Negotiated Ambiguity framework of analysis presents an alternative understanding and explanation <b>of</b> China’s <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> institutions that, by taking institutional ambiguity seriously, sets us on new path of discovery about this important case...|$|R
