40|$|Positive {{temperature}} coefficent (PTC) {{effect in}} polymers was first discovered by Frydman in 1945 for {{low density polyethylene}} loaded with carbon black (CB). After Frydman, many investigators have studied the PTC effect in polymers extensively. Most past works {{are based on the}} experimental results from CB-filled polymers especially CB-filled single semicrystalline polymer composites due to their potential industrial applications. It has been found that non-crosslinked CB-filled semicrystalline polymer composites exhibit a sharp negative temperature coefficient(NTC) effect, which is a great disadvantage for their application in <b>over-temperature</b> <b>protections.</b> To eliminate the NTC effect, one successful approach is to crosslink the semicrystalline polymer matrix by peroxide, Gamma radiation or electron beam. Another method is to use extremely high viscosity polymer matrix such as UHMWPE. Recently, Chan et al used UHMWPE as polymer matrix and prepared CB-filled UHMWPE composites by a sintering method. They found that the CB-filled UHMWPE composites are good PTC materials which do not show NTC effect even though they are not crosslinked. This is a new approach to prepare polymer PTC materials. However, the sintering method has its disadvantage──low production rate. To overcome the problem, the coventional melt-mixing method can be used to prepare CB-filled UHMWPE based composites. The objective {{of this paper is to}} prepare the CB-filled PP/UHMWPE composites by the conventional melt-mixing method and to study the effect of the PP/UHMWPE weight ratio and the CB content on the PTC behaviors of the composite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cellular phone power {{amplifiers}} (PAs) operate in strongly varying environments {{and have to}} withstand extreme conditions. To avoid destructive breakdown a generic protection concept is proposed {{that is based on}} adaptive control of the output power. It provides over-voltage, <b>over-temperature,</b> and/or over-current <b>protection</b> by detection of the collector peak voltage, die temperature, and/or collector current to reduce the effective power control voltage once a threshold level is crossed. By applying protections, PAs can be implemented in low-cost silicon technology competitively to GaAs HBT implementations. In addition, requirements on package thermal resistance are relaxed. In this paper a theoretical analysis is given on the behavior of a class-AB amplifier under mismatch conditions. Measurement results on a silicon bipolar power transistor with integrated protection circuits are presented, proving the concept of adaptive protection. For a supply voltage of 5 V and nominal output power of 2 W no breakdown is observed for a VSWR of 10 over all phases when output power is adaptively reduced by 2. 7 dB at most...|$|R

40|$|Thermal FEM (Finite Element Method) {{simulations}} {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the thermal behavior of power semiconductors in application. Most power semiconductors are made of silicon. Silicon thermal material properties are significantly temperature dependent. In this paper, validity of a common non-linear silicon material model is verified by transient non-linear thermal FEM simulations of Smart Power Switches and measurements. For verification, <b>over-temperature</b> <b>protection</b> behavior of Smart Power Switches is employed. This protection turns off the switch at a pre-defined temperature which is used as a temperature reference in the investigation. Power dissipation generated during a thermal overload event of two Smart Power devices is measured and used as an input stimulus to transient thermal FEM simulations. The duration time of the event together with the temperature reference is confronted with simulation results and thus the validity of the silicon model is proved. In addition, the impact of non-linear thermal properties of silicon on the thermal impedance of power semiconductors is shown. Comment: Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions ([URL]...|$|E
40|$|The wide bandgap {{gallium nitride}} (GaN) and related {{compound}} materials possessattractive properties including high breakdown electric field, high electron saturation velocity, relatively strong piezoelectric effect and excellent capability of operating at high temperatures. GaN-based electronic devices are quickly {{emerging as the}} game changer for many mission-critical applications including high-frequency power amplifiers, high-voltage power switches, high-temperature pressure and gas sensors, etc. For all these applications, {{it is essential to}} build temperature sensing and protection circuits using the GaN device technology, for the benefits of on-chip monitoring and protection. In this work, the temperature-dependent characteristics of the GaN-based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), Schottky barrier diode (SBD) and lateral-field effect rectifier (LFER) are investigated first. Based on the device characteristic, a GaN-based temperature sensor is designed to convert the temperature change into a voltage signal. The output voltage shows a stable negative temperature coefficient. This sensing circuit exhibits a larger temperature sensing range than the silicon CMOS temperature sensors. Thus, an on-chip <b>over-temperature</b> <b>protection</b> circuit is demonstrated for the GaN smart power integrated circuits (IC). This protection circuit features monolithic integration of a temperature sensing circuit and a high-gain comparator circuit, and can be easily integrated with GaN power devices. A proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) sensor circuit is also designed, fabricated and tested using GaN technology for the first time. The output voltage, which is linearly proportional to temperature, shows a positive temperature coefficient. In this design, a HEMT-based current mirror circuit is proposed to substitute PMOS current mirror in the conventional CMOS PTAT sensor design, for compatibility with GaN-HEMT based technology. The Schottky barrier diode (SBD), readily available on the GaN HEMT platform, is used in place of the P-N junction in the CMOS technology. The temperature sensing and protection circuits demonstrated in this work provide the essential analog functional blocks for the implementation of GaN power ICs and integrated sensors...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} compact, {{solid-state}} actuation systems {{for use in}} the aerospace, automotive, and other transportation industries is currently driving research in high-temperature shape memory alloys (HTSMA) having transformation temperatures above 100 C. One of the basic high temperature systems under investigation to fill this need is NiTiPd. Prior work on this alloy system has focused on phase transformations and respective temperatures, no-load shape memory behavior (strain recovery), and tensile behavior for selected alloys. In addition, a few tests have been done to determine the effect of boron additions and thermomechanical treatment on the aforementioned properties. The main properties that affect the performance of a solid state actuator, namely work output, transformation strain, and permanent deformation during thermal cycling under load have mainly been neglected. There is also no consistent data representing the mechanical behavior of this alloy system over a broad range of compositions. For this thesis, ternary NiTiPd alloys containing 15 to 46 at. % palladium were processed and the transformation temperatures, basic tensile properties, and work characteristics determined. However, testing reveals that at higher levels of alloying addition, the benefit of increased transformation temperature begins to be offset by lowered work output and permanent deformation or "walking" of the alloy during thermal cycling under load. In response to this dilemma, NiTiPd alloys have been further alloyed with gold, platinum, and hafnium additions to solid solution strengthen the martensite and parent austenite phases in order to improve the thermomechanical behavior of these materials. The tensile properties, work behavior, and dimensional stability during repeated thermal cycling under load for the ternary and quaternary alloys were compared and discussed. In addition, the benefits of more advanced thermomechanical processing or training on the dimensional stability of these alloys during repeated actuation were investigated. Finally, the effect of quaternary alloying on the thermal stability of NiTiPdX alloys is determined via thermal cycling of the materials to increasing temperatures under load. It was found that solid solution additions of platinum and gold resulted in about a 30 C increase in upper use temperature compared to the baseline NiTiPd alloy, providing an added measure of <b>over-temperature</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports an {{overview}} {{and the main}} results of the research activity carried out within the PhD programme in Information Engineering of the University of Pisa (2010 - 2012). The research activity {{has been focused on}} different fields, including Automotive and High Energy Physics experiments, according to a common denominator: the development of electroni c devices and systems operating in harsh environments. There are many applications that forc e the adoption of design methodologies and strategies focused on this type of envir onments: military, biom edical, automotive, industrial and space. The development of solutions fulfilling specific operational requirements, therefore represents an interesting field of research. The first research activity has been framed within the ATHENIS project, funded by the CORDIS Commission of the European Community, and aiming at the development of a System-on-Chip, a r egulator for alternators employed on vehicles, presenting both configurability an d the ability to work at the harshest operating conditions of the automotive industry. Specifically, a novel Intelligent Power Switch has been conceived, capable of driving different kind of loads, such as incandescent bulbs and LED, showing a high level of flexibility and adaptability to the most extreme operating conditions. Several features have been integrated, including current limitation, voltage regul ation, reverse polar ity and over-voltage capability, control of current slope, combi ned with strategies as over-current and <b>over-temperature</b> <b>protection,</b> that hav e required the design of an innovative architecture. The first test-chip, realized in AMS CMOS High Voltage 0, 35 μm technology, has been validated thanks {{to the development of a}} dedicated test-bed, which has allowed the deep characterization of the dev ice, proving its excellent performance. The second branch of research has been carried out within the FF-LYNX project, which has involved the section of Pisa of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), the Department of Physics of the University of Calif ornia Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The aim of this multidisciplinary project has been the def inition of a protocol for the distribution of Timing, Trigger and Control signals and for the readout in High Energy Physics experiments. In particular, the focus of t he activity has been the implementation of the protocol into Transmitter-Receiver in terfaces within the test-chip FF-TC 1, realized in IBM CMOS 130 nm technology. During this phase, novel radiation hardening techniques have been studied and implemented in order to ensure the proper functioning in operating environments with a high level of radiation, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. Besides that, an emulator for functional validation of the FF-LYNX protocol has been developed, embedded on the XpressGXII PLDA board, equipped with PCI-Express to interface with a host PC.
