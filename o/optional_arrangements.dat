5000|$|All the schemes {{of basic}} and {{supplementary}} pensions in France {{work on the}} method of distribution. The schemes redistribute every year, {{in the form of}} pensions paid to retirees, contributions received that year from the assets. If the rules of the various pension plans in France correspond to different concepts, however they are based on common principles. All schemes incorporate mechanisms of solidarity: solidarity between generations (principle of distribution) and solidarity within a single generation (large redistributions between different occupational groups and gender). These principles of solidarity occurs both in the regimes, between the regimes and beyond regimes at the national level. There are transfers between the schemes, and therefore solidarity between the basic schemes, as well as mechanisms for schemes coordination. Solidarity at the national level consists of the minimum old-age pension assigned to all seniors who have limited resources, paid by the solidarity fund retirement (which also pay some family benefits), but also of state subsidies granted to certain regimes (farmers, SNCF, RATP, mining, marine ...), and finally of various taxes allocated to pensions. The retirement system in France is organized into three levels: a compulsory system, a scheme often mandatory, and <b>optional</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} rigorous work named Derivative {{acquisition of}} the share consists of five chapters, two of which is an introduction and conclusion. In the first chapter the author introduces the reader {{to the concept of}} the share, because it is crucial for all the work. The strangeness of the shares is explained mainly {{on the basis of its}} quantitative and qualitative determination. In the second chapter, the author briefly mentions the {{acquisition of the}} share in the original way, i. e. acquisition of such share which was never owned before. In the Czech legislation, this can be achieved by two similar ways, either during the establishment of the company nor by the accession of the new shareholder during the increasing of the registered capital. Derivative acquisition means the acquisition of the ownership of the share from the previous owner, either by his will or without it. The main part is in one of the third chapter's subchapter, entitled Share transfer agreement. The author pursues the necessities of the transfer share agreement in detail, both those that are laid down by the law, as well as those that are set by the practice of the courts. In addition, the author also proposes additional <b>optional</b> <b>arrangements</b> that may be in the share transfer agreement, and that such right of first refusal or [...] ...|$|E
40|$|People {{living with}} disabilities in our society today {{are more likely to}} be without a job {{compared}} to the rest of the population. The fact that a high number of people are not given the opportunity to work, and thereby being self-sufficient, is a failure for both the individual and the society. My purpose with the study is to increase knowledge and understanding regarding disabilities in the working life, with focus on the disability dyslexia. In the study, I am investigating the employer’s obligations and rights when employing a person with disabilities. To achieve my purpose and answer the research questions in the most adequate way, I am making use of a traditional legal dogmatic method, but also a sociological method focusing on law. Throughout the study, the employer’s equitable obligations to carry into affect for supporting and customizing already during the recruitment process for a person with disabilities are introduced. This is done in order for the individual to be in a comparable situation as remaining jobseekers. Persons with disabilities are entitled to the same rights as others. Previous studies show employers lack knowledge regarding disabilities and what it means to have a disabled employee, and therefore neither wishes nor dares to hire someone with special needs. In lots of other European countries the existence of quota legislation is creating opportunities for people with disabilities to enter the ordinary labour market. Sweden has made the choice to use special arrangements that are for the employer to use if they having a disabled employee. Why Sweden chooses to use this system rather than the quota system is due to the effects from a quota system cannot be distinguished and because the government prefers to have <b>optional</b> <b>arrangements,</b> instead of legislating on quotas...|$|E

40|$|In 1960, two-thirds (68 %) of all Americans {{in their}} twenties were married. But by 2008, just over one-quarter of twenty-somethings (26 %) were wed. According to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, married-couple family {{households}} constituted only 49. 7 % of all households in 2009. The Census Bureau reported in 2009 that 96. 6 million Americans eighteen and older were unmarried, a group comprising 43 % of all U. S. residents eighteen and older. Children’s living arrangements have also undergone substantial change. In the past generation, the percentage {{of children in the}} United States who live with two married parents has markedly declined. Although our culture is still ambivalent about families not based on genetic ties, social acceptance of a wider range of family forms has increased. This multiplicity of family structures means that marriage has become an <b>optional</b> <b>arrangement</b> for creating a family. How did this happen? And where is the American family headed, in both cultural and legal terms? This Article sketches out a framework for analysis of this central social question, and argues that family law is moving in the direction of adopting functional norms for determining family composition and adjudicating family disputes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA simple {{monitoring}} method {{for the early}} warning of rainfall-induced landslides is proposed. Tilting angles in the surface layer of the slope are mainly monitored in this method. In {{the first stage of}} this study with a scaled model slope, distinct behaviors were observed in the tilt angles monitored {{on the surface of the}} slope prior to failure. Hence, a set of equipment has been developed for practical use, which is equipped with a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) tilt sensor and a volumetric water content sensor. An <b>optional</b> <b>arrangement</b> of tilt sensors has also been developed in order to investigate the deformation of the deeper layers. These sets of equipment have been deployed at several slope sites in Japan and China, and their performances have been recorded. Slope failure tests were also conducted on a natural slope by applying artificial heavy rainfall. The developed system detected distinct behaviors in the tilting angles at these sites in the pre-failure stages. Considering the behaviors of tilting monitored on the surfaces of these slopes, it is proposed that a precaution be issued at a tilting rate of 0. 01 ° per hour and a warning be issued at a tilting rate of 0. 1 ° per hour, to be on the conservative side...|$|R

The current production version, 412EP (Enhanced Performance), is equipped with a dual digital automatic flight control system. In 2013 Bell introduced the 412EPI which includes an electronic engine control (FADEC) for a PT6T-9 engine upgrade, and a glass cockpit display system similar to the Bell model 429. Also featured is a Garmin touchscreen navigation system, and the BLR Strake and Fast Fin upgrades for improved hover performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{pressurized}} 414 {{was developed}} to appeal to owners of un-pressurized twin-engined aircraft and {{was based on the}} fuselage of the Cessna 421 and used the wing design of the Cessna 401. The 414 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit and a retractable tricycle landing gear. It is powered by two wing-mounted 310 hp (231 kW) Continental TSIO-520-J horizontally opposed-six piston engines. The prototype, registered N7170C, first flew on 1 November 1968 and production aircraft were available in a number of <b>optional</b> seating <b>arrangements</b> and avionic packages. The name Chancellor was used for models marketed from 1976. An improved variant the Cessna 414A Chancellor was introduced in 1978 with the major change being a re-designed and increased-span wing with integral fuel tanks and an extended nose to give more baggage space.|$|R
