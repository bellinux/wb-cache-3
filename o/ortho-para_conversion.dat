For hydrogen crystals with low ortho-H₂ concentrations (Xo= 0. 03), single-exponential decay of the ortho-H₂ concentration with time is observed which is attributed to H-atom catalyzed o/p conversion by the H-atoms produced during the infrared-induced Cl+H₂ reaction.

40|$|<b>Ortho-para</b> H 2 <b>conversion</b> {{reactions}} {{mediated by}} the exchange of a H+ proton have been investigated at very low energy {{for the first time}} by means of a time independent quantum mechanical (TIQM) approach. State-to-state probabilities and cross sections for H+ + H 2 (v = 0, j = 0, 1) processes have been calculated for a collision energy, Ec, ranging between 10 - 6 eV and 0. 1 eV. Differential cross sections (DCSs) for H+ + H 2 (v = 0, j = 1) → H+ + H 2 (v′ = 0, j′ = 0) for very low energies only start to develop a proper global minimum around the sideways scattering direction (≈ 90 °) at Ec = 10 - 3 eV. Rate coefficients, a crucial information required for astrophysical models, are provided between 10 K and 100 K. The relaxation ortho-para process j = 1 → j′ = 0 is found to be more efficient than the j = 0 → j′ = 1 conversion at low temperatures, in line with the extremely small ratio between the ortho and para species of molecular hydrogen predicted at the temperature of interstellar cold molecular clouds. The results obtained by means of a statistical quantum mechanical (SQM) model, which has previously proved to provide an adequate description of the dynamics of the title reactions at a higher collision energy regime, have been compared with the TIQM results. A reasonable good agreement has been found with the only exception of the DCSs for the H+ + H 2 (v = 0, j = 1) → H+ + H 2 (v′ = 0, j′ = 0) process at very low energy. SQM cross sections are also slightly below the quantum results. Estimates for the rate coefficients, in good accord with the TIQM values, are a clear improvement with respect to pioneering statistical studies on the reaction. © the Owner Societies 2011.

40|$|International audienceContext. Formaldehyde is an {{important}} diagnostic of the physical conditions in star forming regions. The temperature of formation is determined by measuring the relative abundance of para-H 2 CO and ortho-H 2 CO. The key hypothesis for this determination is that the ortho-para interconversion is strictly forbidden once the molecule is formed. However H 2 CO nuclear spin conversion mechanisms do exist in a gas phase either involving reactive or non-reactive collisions. This last process is governed by internal properties of the molecule, such as the mixing of energetically closed ortho-para level pairs, which are coupled through magnetic intramolecular interactions. This mixing is interrupted by a collision that makes the molecule leave the mixed state {{and puts it in}} a pure state, ortho or para, with a non zero probability for both isomeric forms. Aims.

Accurate 1, 3 S and 1, 3 P phase shifts were evaluated by the Kohn and inverse Kohn variational methods in which very flexible trial functions were used. Higher order phase shifts were determined by the static exchange and adiabatic ex-change models in order to obtain the total elastic, momentum-transfer, <b>ortho-para</b> <b>conversion</b> and elastic differential cross sections for the scattering process.

Recent technical advances {{have made it}} possible to perform magic-angle-spinning NMR experiments at low temperatures, allowing researchers to trap reaction intermediates and to perform site-resolved studies of low-temperature physical phenomena such as quantum rotations, quantum tunneling, <b>ortho-para</b> <b>conversion</b> between spin isomers, and super- conductivity. In examining biological molecules, the improved sensitivity provided by cryogenic NMR facilitates the study of protein assembly or membrane proteins. The combination of low-temperatures with dynamic nuclear polarization has the potential to boost sensitivity even further. Many research groups, including ours, have addressed the technical challenges and developed hardware for magic-angle-spinning of samples cooled down to a few tens of degrees Kelvin. In this Account, we briefly describe these hardware developments and review several recent activities of our group which involve low-temperature magic-angle-spinning NMR. Low-temperature operation allows us to trap intermediates that cannot be studied under ambient conditions by NMR because of their short lifetime. We have used low-temperature NMR to study the electronic structure of bathorhodopsin, the primary photoproduct of the light-sensitive membrane protein, rhodopsin. This project used a custom-built NMR probe that allows low-temperature NMR in the presence of illumination (the image shows the illuminated spinner module). We have also used this technique to study the behavior of molecules within a restricted environment. Small-molecule endofullerenes are interesting molecular systems in which molecular rotors are confined to a well-insulated, well-defined, and highly symmetric environment. We discuss how cryogenic solid state NMR can give information on the dynamics of ortho-water confined in a fullerene cage. Molecular motions are often connected with fundamental chemical properties; therefore, an understanding of molecular dynamics can be important in fields ranging from material science to biochemistry.

40|$|The heat {{capacity}} of a substance can be measured under adiabatic or non-adiabatic conditions. Modern experimental techniques allow measurements made under adiabatic conditions to yield values for the specific heat accurate to 0. 1 %. However, knowledge of the solid state at low temperatures {{is still in the}} prospecting stage and new information that is accurate only to 1 % or 2 % is valuable. The non-adiabatic method with its comparatively simple apparatus and ability to produce more rapid results is, therefore, a useful technique to employ. The measurements on solid hydrogen below 4 °K., and irradiated polythene from 15 °K. to room temperature, are good examples of the proper application of this method. The specific heat of solid hydrogen has been measured {{as a function of the}} ortho-para concentration from 0. 2 °K. to 4 °K. There are two species of hydrogen molecule: ortho-hydrogen and para-hydrogen. The ortho-hydrogen molecule in its ground state is nine-fold degenerate, being three-fold degenerate with respect to both the molecular rotation and the nuclear spin. The specific heat anomaly due to the lifting of the ground rotational level of the ortho-hydrogen was found by Simon, Mendelssohn and Buhemann (1929) below 10 °K. Hill (1956) repeated the measurements with improved experimental techniques, but was unable to make measurements below 2 °K. using standard calorimetric practices, due to the spontaneous heat of conversion of the ortho- into para-hydrogen. The total anomalous entropy per mole of ortho-hydrogen above 2 °K. was only 0. 8 E. U. of the expected 2. 18 E. U. (R Log 3). In consequence, the experiments reported here were undertaken to extend the temperature range of the measurements down to 0. 2 °K. This was accomplished by a novel design of calorimeter. The calorimeter was made with two compartments. The first contained liquid helium and had a large diameter pumping tube attached to it; the second contained a powdered paramagnetic salt, iron alum, and the hydrogen specimen, which was condensed between the grains of the salt. By rapid pumping on the liquid helium it was possible to reduce the temperature of the calorimeter to 1. 3 °K., after which a demagnetization of the iron alum reduced the calorimeter and the sample temperature to 0. 2 °K. A time-temperature curve was taken until the calorimeter was above 2 °K., as the rate of warm-up was too rapid for conventional specific heat points to be made. As it could be shown that the heating due to the <b>ortho-para</b> <b>conversion</b> was sensibly temperature independent, it was possible to calculate the specific heat of the sample from the slope of the heating curve and a knowledge of the heating rate. The heating rate was found from conventional specific heat measurements made above 2 °K. The results showed that at ortho-concentrations greater than 60 %, a modified λ-anomaly existed in the temperature range 1 °K. to 2 °K. The form, height, and the temperature of the maximum varied with concentration. For 73 % ortho-hydrogen, the peak is at 1. 60 °K. and 5 calories. degree - 1. mole - 1 high, while with a sample of 63 % ortho-hydrogen, a small peak, 1 calories. degree - 1. mole - 1 high, appears with a maximum as 1. 12 °K. At ortho-concentrations below 60 %, there is no λ-anomaly. The specific heat becomes appreciable at about 0. 2 °K., rises steeply until a temperature of about 0. 6 °K. has been reached, after which it rises slowly to a maximum between 1 °K. and 2 °K., before falling steadily towards the triple point. Whether a λ-peak occurs or not, the total entropy of the anomaly is the same within experimental error. The arithmetical average of the entropy for the different runs is 2. 14 E. U., which is in excellent agreement with 2. 18 E. U. expected theoretically from a lifting of three-fold degenerate state. The existence of a λ-point is consistent with the changes in the nuclear resonance spectrum reported by Hatton and Rollin (1949) and Reif and Purcell (1953) for normal hydrogen, and Sugawara et al (1955) for other ortho-hydrogen concentrations. These experiments only indicate whether or not transitions occur among the substates. They would have obtained the same low temperature resonance pattern, indicating now transitions among states, if the molecules were frozen into arbitrary substates. It is only the existence of the specific heat anomaly of the correct entropy, that indicates that an ordered state is obtained at very low temperatures. These experiments also show that there is no indication of the entropy of mixing of the ortho- and para-molecules. Further, the rate of change of ortho-concentration was found from the libration of heat due to the <b>ortho-para</b> <b>conversion.</b> If o is the ortho-concentration expressed in percent and t is the time in hours, then d o ⁄ dt = 1. 79 × 10 - 4 o 2. The constant is in good agreement with Cremer and Polanyi's value of 1. 9 × 10 - 4. The specific heat of irradiated Polythene was measured from 15 °K. to room temperature with standard calorimetric methods. This sample was the most heavily irradiated out of a set, the remainder of which was measured by Smith (1955). The specific heat per gram was smaller over the whole temperature range than the other polythenes. A theoretical calculation of the specific heat of normal polythene was made, which seemed to indicate that the rapid rise in specific heat of the polythene above 180 °K. was due to molecular vibration at natural CH 2 characteristic frequences, and not to a disorder change in the crystallites of the polythene, as had been assumed by previous workers. The specific heat of Potassium Bromide was measured from 4 °K. to room temperature. A comparison with the measurements of Clusius, Goldman and Perlick (1949) indicated that their values between 40 °K. and 80 °K. were probably too high. The change in the Debye θ at low temperatures could be explained qualitatively with reference to Blackman's (1933, 1937) calculations. </p...|$|E
