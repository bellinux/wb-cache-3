A similar study was undertaken by Bussin in 2003 and the results between the two studies were compared. The data was collected via an anonymous e-mail questionnaire and analysed using quantitative techniques. The key findings were that the retention of key staff and an organisation‘s financial results were primary drivers <b>of</b> changes to <b>remuneration</b> policy; these findings concurred with the 2003 study. However, factors linked to corporate governance, such as Remuneration Committees, Shareholder expectations, Governance/King III have all increased in perceived importance as factors driving changes to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy.</b> The components <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> linked to Merit Pay and Retention Strategies appear to have been subject to the most changes since 2003.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop an {{in-depth}} understanding of the relative importance of the factors driving change to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> decision making and the impact on organisations. A triangulated approach involving qualititative and quantitative analysis was adopted to derive answers to 5 main research questions. The study was split into 2 phases, namely a qualitative and quantitative phase. A qualitative study was undertaken to explore and identify key assumptions and characteristics identifying the main factors driving change to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> (Phase 1). The outcome of the qualitative phase formed the basis for the quantitative phase in which statistical analysis was used (Phase 2). Data from 148 organisations were analysed and subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. Sense was made of these resulting in answers to the research questions. The findings closed gaps in current knowledge and provided insight into the most powerful drivers <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> as well as the extent of change on each component <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy.</b> How each component impacted on organisations is now understood and remuneration decision-makers are able to make more informed decisions based on empirical evidence. The results show that the most potent drivers <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> are retention <b>of</b> key staff, financial results and organisation strategy. The greatest changes to <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> were in the areas of variable pay, merit/ performance related pay, market position, total package and job evaluation/ broadbanding policy. A strong correlation was found between the extent of change and impact on the organisation. This suggests that the greater the change the greater the impact on the organisation.

40|$|Since {{the last}} Polish {{parliamentary}} elections in 2015, some deep {{changes have been}} announced in the legal framework of state-owned companies. The changes {{are supposed to be}} mainly targeted at setting different rules <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> the boards’ members compared to private-owned companies. They are meant to conquer recognised abuses in management and supervision areas of state-owned companies, which have not been overcome by recent, quite liberal legal regulations, nor by self-limitation and self-control. In addition corporate governance in Polish state-owned enterprises is facing massive changes. At the beginning of 2016, former Minister of Treasury Dawid Jackiewicz announced liquidation of the Ministry of Treasury in January 2017, and the revision of State’s supervision over the SOE.

It was determined that the reform of the minimum wage institution led to an increase in the leveling <b>of</b> the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> employees of various categories and professional groups, which practically led to the destruction <b>of</b> the tariff <b>remuneration</b> system in the budgetary sphere. The necessity of reforming the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>remuneration</b> in the budgetary sphere is substantiated.

Analysis of the provisions of the Act of 15 September 2000, the Commercial Companies Code governing the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> members of the management board and supervisory board, showed that within its scope legal controls are fragmentary, giving the company broad autonomy. Yet this autonomy is not of absolute nature and the company is obliged to comply with the principles of law, this including the principle of equity.

40|$|International audienceWe {{applied a}} {{technique}} {{borrowed from the}} field of bioethics to test whether justice-related factors influence laypersons’ decisions concerning business ethics. In the first experiment, participants judged the acceptability <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> and in the second that of executive bonuses. In each study, participants judged a set of 36 situations. To create the scenarios, we varied (a) retributive justice—the amount of remuneration; (b) procedural justice—the clarity of the procedure that determined the remuneration; (c) distributive justice—the extent of the distribution of bonus payments amongst employees; and (d) restorative justice—a special compensation for hazardous working conditions or accidents at work. K-means clustering of all 36 judgments revealed four different personal positions in both experiments. One group of people readily accepted all situations. The other three groups’ judgments were mainly a function of distributive justice modulated in different ways by the context determined by the other variables. Furthermore, people conceive of distributive justice as categorical: Acceptability judgments only increase if companies give bonuses to all employees. Granting bonuses to a subset (i. e. mangers or executives) does not increase acceptability. Our results are useful for policy makers and provide business ethics researchers with a novel technique...|$|R

Objeto: La crisis económica que afecta desde 2008 obliga a prestar mayor atención a los costes de la empresa con consecuencias, en ocasiones, negativas para los trabajadores. Con un efecto paliativo, se pueden aplicar políticas retributivas adaptadas a las necesidades de las personas y aquello que éstas consideran importantes y, así, adaptar la retribución a su realidad social y económica actual. La presente investigación centra la atención en esta política retributiva que se sustenta en valores humanistas y no tangibles que aportan valor añadido a la gestión de las empresas al facilitar la conciliación de la vida personal y profesional. Diseño/metodología/enfoque: Se ha realizado una revisión bibliográfica a partir de 2002 en las bases de datos de PSYCHOINFO, MEDLINE y PSICODOC, además, de revisar investigaciones de IESE y ESADE, dos de las más importantes escuelas de negocios españolas. Se han seleccionado aquellos más importantes que permiten diseñar la estructura de esta política retributiva y su situación en el Estado Español. Aportaciones y resultados: Los estudios analizados permiten determinar que la de retribución no tangible tiene influencia positiva en el entorno profesional y personal del trabajador. Además, se ha podido constatar que compensar al trabajador con algo más que dinero es una práctica que ha ido aumentando dentro de las empresas, aunque la implantación en España es todavía progresiva, y que los trabajadores valoran de manera muy positiva. Implicaciones prácticas: Este estudio permitirá dar a conocer esta política retributiva y potenciar nuevas metodologías adaptadas a los retos sociales y económicos actuales para el equilibrio de la vida personal y profesional. Originalidad / Valor añadido: En un contexto socioeconómico poco favorable, la aplicación de la retribución no tangible supone una nueva vía de equilibrio social y, también, la evolución hacia la buena y mejor gestión humana de las empresas. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{adds to the}} {{empirical}} evidence {{on the extent to}} which the European executives are incentivized and rewarded by stock-based pay. It shows that stock-based compensation of CEOs in European listed firms is usually underestimated and it documents the heterogeneity among countries. We base our work on a sample of 227 large, publicly-traded companies listed in the S&P Europe 350 index from five major European countries: France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and United Kingdom. Through analysing companies’ annual reports, we have hand-collected data on various elements of compensation of the company’s CEO in 2015, with an emphasis on the gains that executives actually realize from stock-based pay. We document that on average half of the total compensation of the European CEOs in our sample is stock-based, measured by actual realized gains. However, there are large differences between countries. Although in France and the UK the majority of total compensation is stock-based, the proportions are still well below those that prevail in the United States. A comparison of realized gains measure of CEO compensation with the data based on fair value estimates shows that the latter underestimates the relevance of share-based pay, in the case of some countries dramatically. Our research findings add to the existing policy debate on transparency <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy</b> and the link between pay and performance of corporate executives in the EU. Based on our work we propose that the Commission should insist that the companies submit executive data in a standardized form that enables international comparisons, and, above all, uses realized gains measures...|$|R

30|$|In most {{countries}} {{the public sector}} is a key economic actor, providing {{a wide range of}} goods and services, regulating the economic activities of firms and households, and redistributing large shares of national income through the tax and benefit system. To execute all these functions, the public sector employs a large fraction of the labor force: on average, government employment represents 15 % of the labor force across the OECD, with compensation of government employees reaching 11 % of GDP (OECD 2011). Employees in the public sector operate in an environment where agency problems are arguably more severe than in the private sector (Dixit 2002; Besley and Ghatak 2003) due, for instance, to the multiplicity of objectives and principals characterizing public sector organizations and the difficulty in measuring output, which can give rise to phenomena such as corruption (Svensson 2005), regulatory capture (Dal Bo 2006), and waste (Bandiera et al. 2009). For these reasons, and given the importance of the tasks carried out in the public sector (e.g. education, health care, law enforcement), understanding what are the characteristics of public sector employees is of primary importance. In particular, whether or not public sector workers are intrinsically motivated to carry out their job in order to serve the public interest, i.e., they have public service motivation, is important, for instance, for the design <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> (Besley and Ghatak 2005; Delfgaauw and Dur 2008; Dal Bo et al. 2013) and the outsourcing of public service provision to for-profit firms (Francois 2000; Francois and Vlassopoulos 2008) 1. The issue of selection of workers into the public sector has also recently received a lot of attention in the development literature (Dal Bo et al. 2013; Hanna and Wang 2013; Banuri and Keefer 2013; Lagarde and Blaauw 2013; Ashraf et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{the subject of}} {{retaining}} the Professional Nurses {{in the public sector}} {{has been one of the}} major challenges and factors that have contributed to the decreased quality of public health services in South Africa. The much needed and valuable skills of the nursing profession have caused South Africa to share its well trained nurses with the rest of the world and other sectors, thus resulting in a brain drain. Although some financial incentive policies such as the Rural Allowance and Scarce Skill Allowance policies had been introduced the South African government still identified a need to introduce a new <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy.</b> In an attempt to curb the retention issue the South African Department of Health with the relevant trade unions negotiated a <b>remuneration</b> and retention <b>policy</b> that would target skills that were considered scarce. This resulted in the establishment of the Occupational Specific Dispensation policy. The implementation of this policy started in 2007 with the nursing profession being the first group to be introduced to this policy. The manner in which a policy is implemented is vital since it is important to determine whether the policy is a success or a failure and whether amendments need to be made or not. However, the implementation of policies tends to be the most overwhelmingly challenging, yet significant task. Studies on the evaluation of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> that are related to public health professionals in South Africa are not sufficient. Therefore the basis of this study is to evaluate the manner in which the Occupational Specific Dispensation policy has been implemented and the outcomes of the implementation at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. This specific case study focused on were the Professional Nurses at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. For a systematic collection of data and analytical purposes the 5 C Protocol Framework was used. An empirical contribution to the body of knowledge on public policy implementation is not only ethical but essential. It is also imperative to identify trends and understand the implementation issues in the public health sector within a South African context. As the architects of public policy the South African government needs to be cognisant of the current state of affairs with regards to public policy implementation.

40|$|Summary In this {{longitudinal}} study we examine how core changes, dwindling membership and ideological embeddedness, lead to financial distress {{in a unique}} organizational setting: declining Israeli kibbutzim. We analyze six years of core changes and their effects on financial distress for 102 Israeli kibbutzim. The research {{is based on an}} organizational macro-temporal dataset where the same 40 changes were measured concurrently and consecutively in 270 kibbutzim. These changes range from incremental or tectonic, to radical, and cover a range of organizational facets. Results indicate that turnaround measures, including radical transformation <b>of</b> governance and <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies,</b> serve only to exacerbate rather than alleviate financial distress. Stronger ideological embeddedness was also found to aggravate financial distress. Dwindling membership Ideology Financial distress Kibbutzim Radical change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} and empirically {{evaluates the}} relationship between the strength of inventors' motives and their productivity, and the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. For our empirical analyses, we use novel data from a survey of Japanese inventors on 5, 278 patents conducted by the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) in 2007 matched with a firm-level survey <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies</b> for employee inventions conducted by the Institute of Intellectual Property (IIP) in 2005. The RIETI survey contains rich information about inventors, patents, and project characteristics, as well as two new measures of inventor productivity. Our study first reveals that satisfaction from contributing to science and technology and interest in solving challenging technical problems are highly associated with inventor productivity. Most notably, the science motivation measure has the largest and the most significant correlation with our measures of inventor productivity. Science orientation may be strongly associated with high R&D productivity because early access to scientific discoveries gives inventors an advantage or because interest in science correlates with inventive ability. However, careful analysis using additional measures of knowledge spillovers from academia and a proxy of inventor ability find little support for either explanation. This result makes the third explanation (science orientation) plausible, that is, the above two task motives simply encourage researchers to dedicate themselves to challenging projects. In order to explore further and based on our interpretation of motivation mentioned above, we present a principal-agent model where the agent selects the type of research projects and exerts effort in the presence of monetary incentives. The model offers the following two empirical implications: (a) firms with many intrinsically motivated employees are less likely to introduce revenue-based pay; and (b) the average value of patents is more positively correlated with the strength of intrinsic motivation in the absence of revenue-based pay than in its presence. Finally, we test the above empirical implications using the matched dataset from the RIETI and IIP surveys and we find little significant support for either prediction. We offer possible explanations for the result. ...|$|R

A study of the most upfront human resources and staff practices in the Russian oil and gas sector has allowed the author to formulate approaches to building effective systems <b>of</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The suggestions described in this paper coordinate the interests of employers and employees. At the same time, they increase efficiency and job satisfaction through raising personal responsibility, which will gain the effectiveness of incentives for oil and gas companies...|$|R
40|$|The {{tourism and}} {{hospitality}} industry {{is perceived as}} being {{a major contributor to}} employment growth in Australia and in north-east New South Wales (NSW) in particular. Despite the importance of the sector there has been very little empirical research into employment relations in the industry. This appears to be a major oversight because labour is crucial to gaining a sustainable competitive advantage and in determining the productivity of the industry. This article helps to overcome this problem by analysing the employment relations in the resorts of north-east NSW, an important sector of the region’s hospitality industry and economy. The study examined the employment instruments used, methods <b>of</b> employee selection, <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies,</b> training, and occupational health and safety. The findings indicate that the larger foreign-owned organisations have adopted a more formal approach to these functions than the smaller Australian-owned resorts who have, nevertheless, started to adopt a more professional approach to employment relations strategies...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{explore the}} reasons why nurses leave public {{hospitals}} for the private sector. Background: While the global shortage of nurses is aggravating, this problem in public hospitals in Hong Kong is worsened by the trend of nurses moving to private hospitals. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand from the perspective of nurses the reasons affecting their decision to stay or leave a hospital. Design: Qualitative approach using narrative analysis. Methods: Data were collected using individual semistructured interviews. Twelve participants who had moved to a private hospital from a public hospital were encouraged to explain why they had made the move. Crossley's analytic method was adopted to analyse the collected data. Results: The nurses' stories were categorised into five sections: 'life in public hospitals', 'decision-making', 'life in the private hospitals', 'future plans' and 'values and beliefs'. Conclusions: The results are consistent with those of previous studies showing that job satisfaction and demographic factors play significant roles in the decision of nurses to switch to another hospital. This study revealed specific reasons why the nurses made the move, such as the fairness <b>of</b> the <b>remuneration</b> <b>policy,</b> significant people and stressors. Relevance to clinical practice: The results have relevance for hospital management with regard to strategies to consider when addressing the issues of staff retention and recruitment.

40|$|This study investigates how listed {{companies}} have implemented {{the requirements of}} the corporate governance code in an African developing economy (Mauritius). There is still little empirical evidence as to whether (and if so to what extent) companies in developing economies on the African continent have been implementing such codes. Furthermore, we argue that past empirical studies have been too narrowly focused by only analysing one particular year of implementation and/or examining some requirements of the code. We seek to contribute to the literature by focusing on the progression (or the lack thereof) in the implementation and disclosure requirements of the code over time. This paper will hence rely on disclosures in the annual reports of {{listed companies}} in Mauritius over a four year period - namely one year (2004) prior to the code's enactment and thereafter for a period of three years (2005 - 2007). In addition, a notable aspect in the local code has been the requirement to provide corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures. In this respect, we examine the extent of progression of CSR disclosures in relation to the 'traditional' requirements of the corporate governance code. We hence bring some empirical evidence on the links between corporate governance and CSR to inform some of the recent conceptual discussions emerging in the literature. Finally, in contrast to the various un-weighted and dichotomous measures used in previous studies, a weighted scoring framework is devised to assess implementation consistently over the survey period. The analysis of the scores reveals a progressive adoption of the code during the first two years (2005 and 2006) but this process has now slowed down. Although the overall level of adoption does appear to be beyond the mere symbolic, detailed implementation and disclosure requirements regarding directors' appraisal and training, determination <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>policies,</b> <b>remuneration</b> information and directors' interest, and CSR disclosures are resisted by many companies. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of the corporate governance scores and firm level measures shows that the level of association between these different variables fluctuates significantly over time, except for the consistent positive influence of independent non-executive directors. The findings bring much needed empirical evidence on corporate governance in African developing nations and emphasise the need for researchers to study corporate governance implementation on a longitudinal basis. In particular, we contend that corporate governance changes at the board level (e. g. new composition, decision-making structures, empowerment over executives) are akin to an organisational change process that cannot be reliably assessed over a one year period. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of a weighted and non-dichotomous scoring approach for the assessment of corporate governance implementatio...|$|R
