30|$|Motivated by the above, {{our main}} {{purpose of this paper}} is firstly to {{introduce}} a concept of mean-value <b>of</b> uniformly <b>almost</b> periodic functions and give some useful and important properties of it.

Finally, we establish some results about the existence and uniqueness <b>of</b> pseudo <b>almost</b> periodic solutions to dynamic equations on time scales.|$|R
