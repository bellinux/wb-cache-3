40|$|This paper puts forward an {{explanation}} for the origin and existence of banks based on the role of information in trade. We consider an economy populated by publicly “visible ” institutions, that is institutions whose actions are observable by every agent in the economy. As long as the extent of trade is limited, these institutions can act as “fairs ” and sustain trade by recording and disseminating information on agents’ behavior. However, as fairs progressively boost trade the speed at which they can disseminate information becomes too low relative to the speed of trade. When this occurs institutions can continue to sustain trade by transforming themselves into banks and issuing notes for the immediate payment of transactions. The visibility of banks prevents them from <b>overissuing</b> notes and hence renders notes valued in equilibrium. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>overissue</b> of vellón coin in Spain {{had driven}} {{gold and silver}} from circulation. After the failure of {{numerous}} attempts to correct this situation, the currency finally underwent a major reform on October 14, 1686, when Spain devalued silver by ≈20% and adopted a dual coinage standard. The old silver standard (plata vieja) was maintained in the American colonies, but a new devalued silver (plata nueva) was adopted for circulation in Spain itself. The old piece of eight was valued at 10 reales of the new silver coin. The new 8-real coin was known as peso sencillo, the old piece of eight as peso fuerte. Foreign exchange was quoted in pesos de cambio, based on the old piece of eight, which continued to be produced in America. After this, the monetary systems of Spain and of Spanish America differed significantly.|$|E

The Mongols used Chinese silver ingot as a unified money of public account, while circulating paper money in China and coins in the western areas of the empire such as Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate. Under Ögedei Khan the Mongol government issued paper currency backed by silk reserves and founded a Department which was responsible for destroying old notes.

We obtain that when this agent can commit to a choice of money supply, there is a monetary equilibrium where it never overissues. We show, however, that monetary equilibria with no <b>overissue</b> do not exist when there is no commitment. This happens because the incentives this agent has to maintain a reputation for providing valuable currency disappear once its reputation is high enough. More generally, we prove that in the absence of commitment <b>overissue</b> happens infinitely often in any monetary equilibrium. We conclude by showing that imperfect memory can restore the positive result obtained with commitment. ...|$|E

Nevertheless, the Nazis deliberately <b>overissued</b> both currencies to finance infrastructure investments by the state, and expanded government employment and expenditure on items such as armaments. By 1935, laws limiting increases of prices, wages, and rents were needed to suppress inflation. Enormous extra taxes, charged on real estate owners (RM 1 bn in 1936), and {{on the occasion of}} the anti-Semitic November Pogrom (...) , on Jewish Germans (RM 1 bn in 1938), could not stabilise the economy for long. The start of World War II was used to justify general price controls and rationing. Thus inflation was officially hidden, and was expressed as ever-growing aggregate savings of the population, which could only spend its earnings on limited rations of goods at artificially low prices. However, inflation could clearly be seen in the rising prices on the black market. During the war, the German economy was supported by war booty taken from occupied countries, continuing to some extent until 1944. By the end of the war, the oversupply of banknotes and coins (RM 3.9 bn in 1933, RM 60 bn in 1945) became obvious, openly showing up in inflated black market prices.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{two distinct}} economic problems where individual and social learning {{play a central}} role. The first chapter analyzes the stability of monetary regimes in a decentralized economy where fiat money is endogenously created by the government, information about its value is imperfect, and agents only learn from their private experience. It establishes that in poorly informed economies, monetary stability is only possible with sufficiently patient governments, whereas in economies where agents gather information more easily, monetary stability is possible even with impatient governments. A dynamics of fiat money acceptability is obtained that resembles historical accounts of the rise and eventual demise of <b>overissued</b> paper money. Moreover, {{the results from this}} chapter provide an explanation for the fact that, despite its obvious advantages, the widespread use of fiat money is only a very recent development. The second chapter analyzes how learning in society can overcome, in two-armed bandits, the so-called Rostchild effect. It considers an economy populated by a continuum of infinitely lived agents where each one of them faces a two-armed bandit, and the stochastic payoffs of these bandits are the same for each individual. These agents are randomly and anonymously matched in every period, and they observe the current action choice of their partner. Two results are established. First that the resulting game has a symmetric equilibrium in Markovian strategies. Second, and the main result, that in any symmetric sequential equilibrium the fraction of the agents choosing the inferior arm converges to zero. ...|$|R
60|$|A great {{conflict}} for national existence made necessary, for temporary purposes, {{the raising of}} {{large sums of money}} from whatever source attainable. It made it necessary, in the wisdom of Congress--and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the necessity of the times--to devise a system of national currency which it proved to be impossible to keep {{on a par with the}} recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extravagance and luxury not required for the happiness or prosperity of a people, and involving, both directly and indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency, being of fluctuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions requiring money, became a subject of speculation within itself. These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and lender, which should be paid in coin, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted--gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government can not be violated toward creditors without national disgrace. But our commerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding and carrying capacity increased; foreign markets sought for products of the soil and manufactories, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a new market can be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil, the mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to the advantage of the whole people. But, in my judgment, the first step toward accomplishing this object is to secure a currency of fixed, stable value; a currency good wherever civilization reigns; one which, if it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market with some other; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Gold and silver are now the recognized medium of exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal-tender system was adopted, and debt contracted, there should be no delay--certainly no unnecessary delay--in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted--with legislation to carry it out--looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others. But even these, I believe, would be disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal-tender medium of exchange. A revival of productive industry is needed by all classes; by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sale. But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief? Would it not be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his liabilities? Than to do this, would it not be safer, for fear of <b>overissues</b> by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt obligations are obliterated in the United States, and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the time free from incumbrance? These propositions are too absurd to be entertained for a moment by thinking or honest people. Yet every delay in preparation for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that a convenient season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by Congress, or by national disasters which will destroy, for a time at least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. A sound currency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of the nation and of individuals. I believe it is in the power of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperity to last for many years and to save the credit of the nation and of the people. Steps toward the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to this devoutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether private money is viable {{in the absence of}} any external control is an old one. We address it in an economy with decentralized trade and information where a self-interested agent, the bank, has the monopoly over the provision of fiat money and is not limited on how much it can issue over time. The assumption of decentralized information is a crucial one and sets this work apart from all previous investigations in the literature. We argue below that the latter is a necessary assumption if one wants to capture the absence of any external limits on the bank’s behavior. We first show that if the bank can commit to a choice of money supply, a monetary equilibrium with no <b>overissue</b> exists. This equilibrium, however, is not time-consistent, and so does not survive when no commitment is possible for the bank. In fact, we show that with no commitment, the only monetary equilibria possible have <b>overissue</b> happening infinitely many times. We finish by showing how this time-consistency problem can be solved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the existence of}} equilibria for environments in which outside money is issued competitively. Such equilibria are typically believed not to exist because of a classic <b>overissue</b> problem: if money is valued in equilibrium, an issuer produces money until its value is driven to zero. By backward induction, money cannot have value in the first place. However, for any given finite amount of money outstanding, a monetary economy typically has two equilibria. In one, money has value; in the other, money is not valued because no one expects it to be valued. This paper takes this latter equilibrium seriously and shows that trigger strategies eliminate the <b>overissue</b> problem if agents have beliefs of the following type: if an issuer produces money beyond some threshold amount, then the issuer’s money has no value. This result is very general, applying to any monetary economy in which equilibria with and without valued money exist if the money supply is finite. The paper also compares the allocation achieved by a monopolist to that achieved with competitive issuance in both a search and an overlapping-generations environment. The results depend on the environment considered, but two general conclusions arise. First, it is ambiguous whether competitive issuers can achieve a more desirable allocation than a monopolist. Second, with competitive issuance, a licensing agency can always improve on pure laissez-faire and achieve the efficient allocation in the long run. Equilibrium (Economics); Money...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} policy {{question that}} is currently being discussed by central bankers and academics is whether the “shadow” banking system should have a permanent backstop from the central bank akin to the extraordinary support that {{was provided by the}} Federal Reserve to the shadow banking system in 2008. I answer this question by (i) using a macroeconomic analysis of banking (ii) to explain the role played by the first lender of last resort in 19 th c. Britain and (iii) applying this analysis to the modern shadow banking system. I conclude that because of its heavy reliance on collateralization, the shadow banking is a poor substitute for the traditional banking system and does not merit the support of a “dealer” of last resort. My macroeconomic framework explaining the role played by banks in economic growth builds on Cavalcanti and Wallace (1999) and was developed in Sissoko (2006) and Sissoko (2007). This framework explains that in an environment with liquidity constraints banks are special because their history of default is public, so unsecured bank borrowing is incentive compatible when bankers profit from their special characteristic by underwriting the debt of the non-banks in the economy. This debt circulates as bank liabilities and can resolve the liquidity constraints faced by the economy entirely, facilitating economic growth (and generating fees for bankers). Because being liquidity constrained is a significant penalty, a simple trigger strategy played by banks against defaulting non-banks can support an environment where borrowers limit their own debt, credit is generally available, and the economy grows to its maximum potential. The distinctions between this model and the most important competing model of banks as issuers of “information insensitive” assets in Gorton and Ordonez (2014), are first that safe assets take the form of unsecured debt, and second, that they are actually safe, because borrowers themselves do not want to borrow more than they can pay. Crises take place in my environment when there is a loss of confidence in the credit system. To explain the role of the lender of last resort, I turn to the actual historical environment on which my model of banking is based, 18 th – 19 th c. Britain. In Britain the privately-issued bills that circulated in the money market were so safe that collateralizing them was viewed as clearly superfluous. Several institutions made these privately-issued bills safe: they were guaranteed by at least two parties, the issuer, the bank-acceptor, and anyone who chose to sell the debt, bank owners faced capital calls for bad debts the bank had guaranteed, the bills were short-term, and the credit system itself was protected by the existence of a lender of last resort. The lender of last resort made the provision of banking services incentive compatible for bankers who effectively faced unlimited liability by providing high-powered money in liquidity crises and thereby averting the threat of a transition to a no-credit equilibrium. The lender of last resort played a second very important role: {{in order to maintain the}} “safe” quality of the money supply the central bank withdrew support from any bank that it believed to be <b>overissuing</b> debt. The words “last resort” themselves refer to this management of moral hazard by the central bank. Shadow banking developed in an environment where the second duty of the lender of last resort had been forgotten, and solvency for large banks was effectively redefined to incorporate public sector support. Shadow banking has been described as market-based short-term finance of long-term lending, but in fact refers to a bank-guaranteed system of finance based on commercial paper and repurchase agreements, that provides little funding for private sector assets and significant funding for investment banks. In other words, to the degree that shadow banking has disintermediated commercial banks, it has done so by reintermediating investment banks – using repurchase agreements, which are a form of funding that is even more unstable than deposits, due to their reliance on collateral that is remargined daily. Furthermore, the growth of the collateralized money market that shadow banking represents is probably destabilizing the incentive structure that is the product of centuries of institutional evolution and that undergirds the traditional unsecured money markets upon which the past 250 years of economic growth have been founded. Although it is often claimed that the purpose of a “dealer of last resort” is to support liquidity on asset markets, in practice, the policy is designed to give the largest dealer banks access to central bank credit and to support them though a crisis – as we saw in 2008. I explain that this policy only protects asset markets from fire sales of assets belonging to the select group that has access to central bank lending, not from fire sales in general, because dealer banks do not extend credit in the same way that commercial banks do. Finally, commercial banks traditionally bear risk for the economy, whereas dealer banks traditionally avoid bearing risk over time themselves but instead facilitate the allocation of that risk to others. As a result, dealer banks should not receive support similar to that of commercial banks, because they do not play the same role in the economy that commercial banks do...|$|R

40|$|O f the bullionist {{writers who}} {{advocated}} {{restoration of the}} gold con-vertibility of England’s currency during the Bank Restriction period 1797 – 1821, few are as little known today as John Wheatley. Certainly his name is not as familiar as those of David Ricardo, Henry Thornton, Thomas Malthus, Francis Horner, William Huskisson, and other bullionists. Yet in some respects {{he was the most}} original of the group. His Essay on the Theory of Money and Principles of Commerce (1807) spelled out the logic and implica-tions of the strict bullionist position more forcefully and systematically than any document before Ricardo’s High Price of Bullion: A Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes (1810). To Wheatley belongs much of the credit for expounding at least four hard-line bullionist propositions often attributed to Ricardo. First, money-stock changes have no effect on output and employment. Second, exchange rate de-preciations, a high price of gold, and specie drains stem solely from an excess issue of currency. Third, being purely monetary phenomena, exchange rate changes, gold price movements, and specie drains are immune to real shocks operating through the balance of payments. Fourth, exchange rate depreciation and the excess of market over mint price of gold constitute proof and measure of <b>overissue</b> in inconvertible paper regimes. To these can be added a fifth con-tribution: his demonstration that monetary expansion and price inflation can continue indefinitely on a given gold base if all countries expand in step. Wheatley derived these propositions from an analytical model character-ized by sharp dichotomization of real and monetary sectors. He sought to show that monetary shocks do not affect real variables nor real shocks monetar...|$|E
