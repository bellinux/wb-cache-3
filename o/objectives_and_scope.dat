CbC reporting will require certain multinationals to provide reports to the Australian Tax Office outlining their global financial activities.

In accordance with the characterized model environmental exhaust was transformed to environmental load while normalization and weighted evaluation were also made, from which different environmental impacts potential values could be attained. So as to {{the environmental impact of}} life cycle of air conditioning systems could be quantitatively described by the environmental impact load.
