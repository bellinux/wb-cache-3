5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were <b>obviously</b> admissible against Kretske, but less <b>obviously</b> admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|While {{there can}} be {{considerable}} variation across members of a species—and while the results are <b>obviously</b> impacted by the effects of moult and feather regeneration—even very closely related species show clear differences in their wing formulas.|$|E
5|$|Among more <b>obviously</b> serious matters, Roberts {{pointed to}} the Herbert board's {{imposition}} of a rule that shop-floor employees, mostly if not all male, must wear pink uniforms as being typical of its distance from reality, fad-ism and tendency to make mountains of molehills.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt often focuses, as well, on {{specific}} traits {{by comparing the}} characters not to those of real life but to characters in Shakespeare's other plays, comparing, for example, Iago with Edmund in King Lear. His interest {{in the art of}} drama emerges even more <b>obviously</b> when he compares Iago with the villainous character Zanga in Edward Young's The Revenge (1721), still a popular play in Hazlitt's day.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are <b>obviously</b> not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, whilst back in Paris, Hunter met Alice Toklas, whom he {{had known}} {{previously}} in San Francisco. She took {{him to see the}} collection at 27 rue de Fleurus, that was being started by Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo Stein. Toklas wrote of this re-meeting that Hunter was at first shocked by the style of artists such as Matisse, but <b>obviously</b> strongly impressed.|$|E
5|$|In a more Christianized version, St.Elijah shoots {{lightning}} at the devils {{who lead}} the hail clouds; the devils {{in this case}} are <b>obviously</b> ale. As shown by these examples, beliefs with various degrees of Christianization, from none to almost complete, can exist side by side.|$|E
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm <b>obviously</b> looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less <b>obviously</b> steroid-like in structure. Other typical {{examples}} of this group are ZK216348 and 55D1E1. The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E
5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then I {{came up with}} the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it <b>obviously</b> means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{asked if}} they could use {{something}} like Steven Sykes's dummy railhead which had worked so well at Misheifa. Barkas answered that he intended to build a dummy water pipeline to go down south, and to be <b>obviously</b> not ready.|$|E
5|$|Secord's {{fears were}} justified, as USAF {{reconnaissance}} aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 {{revealed that the}} paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were <b>obviously</b> approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road constructing activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.|$|E
5|$|The brewery's blood {{red heart}} shield and dagger logo was {{introduced}} in 1863. The name was changed to Worthington's in 2002 and shield became more <b>obviously</b> heart shaped. The shield was restored in 2011, and the brand's design was modified to resemble its 1920s appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{familiar}} Pauling electronegativity scale relies upon {{chemical bond}} energies, but such values have <b>obviously</b> not been measured for inert helium and neon. The Allen electronegativity scale, which relies only upon (measurable) atomic energies, identifies neon {{as the most}} electronegative element, closely followed by fluorine and helium.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is most <b>obviously</b> {{seen in the}} {{establishment}} of September 11 as Panamerican Teacher's Day which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, held in Panama. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America's teacher. In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, opened immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.|$|E
5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to revert {{to the practice of}} auctioning the offices, <b>obviously</b> causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of the}} Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E
5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would <b>obviously</b> not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is <b>obviously</b> implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
5|$|The webs of spiders {{on which}} Portia species prey {{sometimes}} contain dead insects and other arthropods which are uneaten or partly eaten. P. fimbriata (in Queensland) {{and some other}} Portia species such as P. labiata and P. schultzi sometimes scavenge these corpses if the corpses are not <b>obviously</b> decayed.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it <b>obviously</b> altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force <b>obviously</b> contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the cause}} of Themistocles's unpopularity in 479BC, it <b>obviously</b> did not last long. Both Diodorus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly {{restored}} to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479 BC, {{he seems to have}} enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.|$|E
5|$|While {{there may}} have been the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognisable and <b>obviously</b> different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is also very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|With The Mansion Of Happiness {{published}} from 1800 in England to 1926 in The United States, it is {{the longest}} continuously published board game with a known designer, George Fox. That totals 126 years of continuous publication. <b>Obviously</b> Chess, Draughts (Checkers), Go, and many other board games have been continuously published for a longer time, {{but no one knows}} the designer of these games.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite <b>obviously</b> did not pay to be honest.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman <b>obviously</b> younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee injury was fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied {{upside down in}} the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an <b>obviously</b> {{religious}} theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was <b>obviously</b> primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and <b>obviously</b> I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|I think it's {{something}} that is so unique about Rihanna whatever she's doing, whatever character she's playing, whatever side of herself she's showing, she's in it 1,000 percent... And I think the song and {{the theme of this}} song, she wanted to <b>obviously</b> show a softer side, a lighter side, one that's caught in maybe a tumultuous relationship... There's so much variety with her and it's been such a journey with her.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so <b>obviously</b> written with the {{expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds {{employment}} as a pharmacist {{in a local}} drug store; but his boss, Mr. Primont (Gavin Gordon)—who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so—constantly demeans Mr. Fisher <b>obviously</b> out of retaliation, much to Danny's embarrassment. That situation {{makes it easier for}} Danny to go against his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. Danny does; and when he becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Not all, one suspects, were yielded willingly to Æthelwold's {{grasping}} representatives... Æthelwold <b>obviously</b> {{wanted his}} monasteries to be centres of spiritual power, an aim {{he sought to}} fulfil by making them the home of as many saints as possible. Undoubtedly too he was anxious to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{a copy of}} the {{withdrawal}} plan was sent across the river for Urquhart's consideration. Despite the <b>obviously</b> frustrating content, Urquhart knew there was little other choice and radioed Thomas at 08:00 to agree to the plan on the condition it went ahead that night. Meanwhile, the Airborne forces would need to endure another day in their perimeter. More men were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day, but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire.|$|E
5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer <b>obviously</b> knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not <b>obviously</b> resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
25|$|The right- and left-cancellative {{elements}} of a monoid each in turn form a submonoid (i.e. <b>obviously</b> include the identity and not so <b>obviously</b> are closed under the operation). This means that the cancellative {{elements of}} any commutative monoid can be extended to a group.|$|E
