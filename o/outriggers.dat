5|$|During the Depression, {{the state}} sought to ease {{unemployment}} through {{public works projects}} as an economic stimulus. It applied this to the new Highway 82. First it converted the Maroon Creek Bridge for automotive traffic by widening it with a timber deck, which was then paved and supported with <b>outriggers.</b> In 1937, four miles (6.4km) between Glenwood Springs and Carbondale was paved; {{the remainder of the}} road to Aspen was oiled the following year.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded <b>outriggers</b> that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|Utor caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} in Cebu, Leyte, and Boracay, resulting in widespread loss of telecommunication. A single electric pole in northern Cebu caught fire during the storm, cutting out power to eight peripheral towns. Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout. Off of Boracay, a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized. Another 67ships, {{which consisted of}} speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage. Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, littering its beaches with debris. A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000L (6,600gal) of diesel fuel. Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz {{as a result of}} falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods. Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43ferry services. Similarly, 8,000people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing. Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421damaged. Rough seas caused the <b>outriggers</b> on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to break apart, causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued. Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.|$|E
25|$|When {{using the}} outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes the {{location}} of the ski on the snow. <b>Outriggers</b> are used to stop using a technique that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the <b>outriggers</b> down.|$|E
25|$|Skiers use <b>outriggers</b> {{for balance}} and as {{leverage}} when they fall to right themselves. <b>Outriggers</b> {{are also used}} for turning, with the skier using the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, <b>outriggers</b> or ski poles are used top propel the skier forward. If a skier falls, they may require assistance in righting themselves {{to get back to}} the fall line. Doing this on their own, the skier needs to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E

25|$|For {{stability}} in rougher waters, canoes can be fitted with <b>outriggers.</b> One or two small logs are mounted {{parallel to the}} main hull by long poles. In the case of two <b>outriggers,</b> one is mounted {{to either side of}} the hull. These are called outrigger canoes.|$|E
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} use <b>outriggers,</b> or booms, to tow the trawl. These <b>outriggers</b> {{are usually}} fastened to, {{or at the}} foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.|$|E

50|$|In an <b>outrigger</b> {{canoe and}} in sailboats {{such as the}} proa, an <b>outrigger</b> is a thin, long, solid, hull used to {{stabilise}} an inherently unstable main hull. The <b>outrigger</b> is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull {{is less likely to}} capsize. If only one <b>outrigger</b> is used on a vessel, its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction.|$|R

40|$|The {{responses}} of composite buildings under wind loads clearly become more critical as the building becomes taller, less stiff and more lightweight. When the composite building increases in height, the stiffness {{of the structure}} becomes more important factor and introduction to belt truss and <b>outrigger</b> system {{is often used to}} provide sufficient lateral stiffness to the structure. Most of the research works to date is limited to reinforced concrete building with <b>outrigger</b> system of concrete structure, simple building plan layout, single height of a building, one direction wind and single level of <b>outrigger</b> arrangement. There is a scarcity in research works about the effective position of <b>outrigger</b> level on composite buildings under lateral wind loadings when the building plan layout, height and <b>outrigger</b> arrangement are varied. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the optimum location of steel belt and <b>outrigger</b> systems by using different arrangement of single and double level <b>outrigger</b> for different size, shape and height of composite building. In this study a comprehensive finite element modelling of composite building prototypes is carried out, with three different layouts (Rectangular, Octagonal and L shaped) and for three different storey (28, 42 and 57 -storey). Models are analysed for dynamic cyclonic wind loads with various combination of steel belt and <b>outrigger</b> bracings. It is concluded that the effectiveness of the single and double level steel belt and <b>outrigger</b> bracing are varied based on their positions for different size, shape and height of composite building...|$|R
40|$|In tall {{buildings}} design, lateral loads induced by wind or earthquake forces are often resisted by an <b>outrigger</b> system. This system is often chosen as its function by tying the structural components together to provide sufficient lateral stiffness {{to the structure}} and control the excessive drift due to the lateral load. This thesis is to analyze the behavior of two 30 stories residential buildings that interconnected by a link bridge which acted as an exterior <b>outrigger</b> system at different heights and also the <b>outrigger</b> system location optimization. A total of five models with different configuration of exterior <b>outrigger</b> system which interconnecting the two multi-stories buildings had been analyzed by using ETABS software program. There is one model with no <b>outrigger</b> system is applied, three models with <b>outrigger</b> system interconnected at different height locations which are level 10, level 20 and level 30 of the buildings respectively, and last model with <b>outrigger</b> system is applied at three levels which are level 10, 20 and 30. The modeling process {{was carried out in}} such a way that the behavior and performance of the structure was within the limitations suggested by BSI (2001) CP 3 : Chapter V- 2 : 1972. From the results, the percentage of reduction in lateral displacement is directly proportional to the number of level of <b>outrigger</b> system applied to the multi-stories buildings. By comparison, it is structurally efficient to locate an exterior <b>outrigger</b> system at the top of a building. Study has shown that it is indeed helpful in reducing the lateral displacement of building structure by applying the <b>outrigger</b> system as an exterior structural system for interconnecting between the multi-stories buildings...|$|R
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, <b>outriggers</b> or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of <b>outriggers.</b> The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. <b>Outriggers</b> are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base.
