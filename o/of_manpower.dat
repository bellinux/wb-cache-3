5|$|The same historians {{would not}} {{consider}} the immense logistical effort fielded by the U.S. to sustain its military in Southeast Asia as a waste <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and resources, even if only one American soldier in four assigned to South Vietnam served in the combat arms.|$|E

The aim of this investigation was to obtain a picture of the institutions rendering health and welfare services, the facilities available and the manpower involved in these services. During the past two decades much attention has been devoted to the availability <b>of</b> educated <b>manpower</b> in all fields of the labour market.

5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> led to a {{shortage}} of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

5|$|The {{orchestra}}'s loss <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> was {{far worse}} in the Second World War than in the First. Between 1914 and 1918 there were 33 members of the LSO away on active service; between 1939 and 1945 {{there were more than}} 60, of whom seven were killed. The orchestra found replacements wherever it could, including the bands of army regiments based in London, whose brass and woodwind players were unofficially recruited.|$|E
40|$|Asean Economic Community (AEC) 2015 {{is a big}} {{global economy}} access for ASEAN members {{with one of the}} focus is related with free access <b>of</b> foreign <b>manpower.</b> The free access <b>of</b> foreign <b>manpower</b> {{entrance}} to Indonesia has to be balanced with regulations on foreign manpower’ entrance as well as their employment. This research is aimed to understand Constitution No. 13 2003 about regulations on Foreign Man Power coming to Indonesia and to identify the relevance of man power regulation in facing AEC. The research method used is normative law research with reference to regulations that are related with Permission <b>of</b> Foreign <b>Manpower</b> Employment (IMTA, Ijin Mempekerjakan Tenaga Kerja Asing). Research result shows that Constitution No. 13 2003 on Manpower is adequate in relation with IMTA and that regulation to change or revise these rules is not found yet. This does not close the opportunity of changes on the implemented rules of the Constitution. The effort <b>of</b> regulating Foreign <b>Manpower</b> is by limiting the position and employment <b>of</b> Foreign <b>Manpower</b> in a company, as well as increasing requirements in Foreign Manpower employment proposals. Improvement <b>of</b> Indonesian <b>manpower</b> capabilities through various education and training for job searchers or for substitutes filling existing position occupied by Foreign Manpower is also included in the moves of facing AEC 2015...|$|R

5|$|With the {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat a shortage <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped.

5|$|A {{task force}} was formed, {{comprising}} polytechnic principals and representatives from Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Manpower</b> (MOM) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) {{to explore the}} feasibility of a new model that built upon the Poly-FSI initiative.

5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E
5|$|By 13 September the regiment's {{strength}} was four officers and eighty other ranks. All of them except fourteen machine-gunners were evacuated {{to the island}} of Lemnos. Of the original contingent who had landed in May only twenty-four men were still with the regiment. On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine officers and 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli, reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November. Lack <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> meant they could not fully man their trenches, so a system was adopted where six men manned a post, with only two on duty during the day. At night all men were awake and also patrolled between posts and into no man's land.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{formation}} of the 3rd Division, Barrowclough had been aware that New Zealand's ability to keep it and the 2nd New Zealand Division in the field was limited. However, so long as the Japanese posed a threat to New Zealand's security, there was still political will for the 3rd Division to be maintained. With the Japanese no longer a meaningful concern to the country, New Zealand's increasing shortage <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Division. As well as providing reinforcements for the 2nd New Zealand Division, at the time engaged in fighting in Italy, it allowed men to return to vital industries in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, {{as part of}} a re-organisation of Australia's {{military}} {{following the}} disbandment of the AIF, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force based in New South Wales. It remained in existence throughout the inter-war years until it was amalgamated with the 24th Light Horse Regiment in 1936 as a result <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> shortages. The 12th Light Horse Regiment was re-formed in 1938 and undertook garrison duties in Australia during the Second World War, having been converted first to a motor regiment and then to an armoured car regiment. It was disbanded in 1943 without having seen action and was never re-raised. Its honours and traditions are perpetuated in the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers.|$|E
5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves <b>of</b> <b>manpower</b> available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, as Major General Ulysses Grant {{prepared}} to launch his Overland Campaign, he removed fresh troops from the defensive fortifications of Washington and transferred them into the field to strengthen the Army of the Potomac. Capitalizing on this reduction <b>of</b> <b>manpower,</b> Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Jubal Early to launch an offensive against the largely undefended capital from the Shenandoah Valley. The attack failed, however the fact that Confederate troops advanced {{to the outskirts of}} Washington D.C. caused widespread panic. This prompted Lincoln to issue a call for 500,000 troops to serve a brief term of 100 days to bolster defenses around the capital.|$|E
