5|$|The Clergy of the <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> Prelature are {{priests who}} are under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Prelate of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei.</b> They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> members are part of the clergy. Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.|$|E
5|$|According {{to several}} journalists {{who have worked}} {{independently}} on <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei,</b> such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say {{that most of these}} myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> members generally practise what they preach.|$|E
5|$|In Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree {{known as}} the Apostolic {{constitution}} Ut Sit, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> is pastor to the members and priests of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by Ut Sit and by the Catholic Church's general law, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> is governed by the Church's Particular Law concerning <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei,</b> otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> prelature {{is known}} as the Prelate. The Prelate is the primary {{governing}} authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women). The Prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> is Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz Braña, who became the third Prelate of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> on January 23, 2017. The first Prelate of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> was Álvaro del Portillo, who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a critical study of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei,</b> journalist John L. Allen, Jr. concluded that <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate {{with members of}} religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|As of 2016, {{there were}} 94,776 {{members of the}} Prelature: 92,667 lay persons and 2,109 priests. These figures {{do not include the}} diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, {{estimated}} to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are in more than 90 countries. About 70% of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> members live in their private homes, leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers, while the other 30% are celibate, of whom the majority live in <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> centers. <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> organizes training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life. Aside from personal charity and social work, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> members are involved in running universities, university residences, schools, publishing houses, hospitals, and technical and agricultural training centers.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> {{received}} some unwanted attention {{due to the}} extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei</b> and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively.

5|$|In her 2006 book on <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei,</b> Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, {{argues that}} the {{relative}} autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level.

5000|$|Plunkett is perplexed {{whether the}} monstrosity that scares both the rightist Spaniard of the 1940s and the {{contemporary}} journalist is really monstrous {{or it is}} <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei's</b> vision of life, the Catholic vision of life, something that escapes the [...] "politically correct" [...] of each era, i.e. those who are behave in ideologic conformity to an orthodox authority of a specific time.|$|R
50|$|A {{contemporary}} example {{seen by many}} as of a sign of contradiction is Pope John Paul II.While Pope, he {{was called}} a reactionary and an ultraconservative, and was often criticized, stridently at times, by the media, non-Catholic and Catholics alike. He was criticized for his views on sex, homosexuality, birth control, and {{the role of women in}} the church. He was criticized for some of his canonizations, including the canonization of <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei's</b> founder, St. Josemaría Escrivá.|$|R
25|$|Critics {{also say}} that the novel's {{allegations}} of dealings between John Paul II and the order concerning the Vatican Bank also have no basis in reality. Allegedly due to these dealings, <b>Opus</b> <b>Dei's</b> founder was declared a Saint just 20 years after his death. In reality, Josemaría Escrivá was canonized 27 years after his death; admittedly faster than some others—but this is attributed to streamlining of the whole process and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|R
