5|$|After the war, {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>supporters</b> rose, {{and by the}} early 1960s this number had {{increased}} to highs of 12,000.

5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network <b>of</b> <b>supporters</b> beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E

Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups <b>of</b> <b>supporters</b> and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. English clubs were banned indefinitely from European competition, with a condition that when the ban was lifted, Liverpool would serve an extra three-year ban. The ban eventually lasted for five years, clubs returning to European competition in the 1990–91 season.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool won {{a trophy}} treble during Fagan's {{first season as}} manager, winning the League title for the third {{straight}} year, the Football League Cup for the fourth straight year and a fourth European Cup.

Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final versus Juventus, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups <b>of</b> <b>supporters,</b> and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, caused a five year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.|$|E
