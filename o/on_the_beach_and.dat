5|$|Heim's atome {{was more}} attuned {{to the sense of}} propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard's design but Réard's was the design that won the public's {{imagination}} over time. Though Heim's design was the first worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> sold more swimsuits, it was Réard's description of the two-piece swimsuit as a bikini that stuck. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey.|$|E
5|$|Some years later, he overhears a woman {{singing a}} tune Gelsomina often played. He learns that the woman's father had found Gelsomina <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> kindly taken her in. However, she had wasted away and died. Zampanò gets drunk and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.|$|E

5|$|The main beaches, codenamed White and Red, lay {{in front}} of Dieppe itself. Making only minor gains, the {{majority}} of the 4th and 6th Brigades became pinned down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> despite the arrival of an armoured squadron from the Calgary Tank Regiment, casualties were heavy. Reinforcements from the Mont Royals had little effect, and surviving forces were withdrawn by 11:00. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian troops that participated, more than half were killed, wounded or captured.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the episode, {{a unique}} type of {{flashback}} is shown: one on the island. In the aftermath of Oceanic Flight 815 crash's, Locke wakes up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> notices that his toes wiggle, making him realize that he is no longer paralyzed. He stands up and is called over by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help with an injured person.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{the whole}} video set {{is made in}} {{tropical}} and romantic setting. The video begins with a shot of Rihanna herself laying down in grass. Then scenes of Rihanna walking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
50|$|Kitesurfing and windsurfing {{are popular}} in the ocean off Lancelin, as are sandboarding <b>and</b> 4-wheel driving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> dunes behind the town.|$|R

5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury the gun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> {{send a letter to}} Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as to the location of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings.|$|E
50|$|To improve ship safety, the {{government}} constructed lighthouses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands. They indicate navigable channels and {{have reduced the}} number of shipwrecks, but many old hulks are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> under <b>the</b> waters.|$|R
5000|$|The Western Australian {{coastal town}} of Denmark, {{part of the}} Great Southern region, is the {{location}} for filming. [...] For Tim Winton this was an ideal location, [...] "The Great Southern region has had {{an enormous impact on}} my life and work so I'm very pleased this film is being shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> streets and forests that inspired the book," ...|$|R
50|$|The {{invasion}} of Normandy began on 6 June 1944. Troops, equipment and vehicles were landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> they were soon followed {{by thousands of}} Jerrycans of fuel. 13,400 tons of fuel were landed this way on Dday itself.|$|R
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there {{is likely to be}} more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill {{one of the three}} women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{elephant}} seals, California sea lions, sea otters, {{and other}} marine mammals come ashore to rest, mate, and give birth {{in the sand}} dunes or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> offshore islands. Hundreds {{of thousands of people}} come to witness it each year.|$|R
5000|$|Cats, pigs, {{goats and}} house mice were {{introduced}} to Malden during the guano-digging period. While the goats and pigs have all died off, feral cats and house mice are still present. [...] Small numbers of green turtles nest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> <b>and</b> hermit crabs abound.|$|R
6000|$|And Kotick {{curled up}} his {{mustache}} (it was a beauty) and said, [...] "I {{am the only}} white seal that has ever been born <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> <b>and</b> I am <b>the</b> only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands." ...|$|R
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off {{for weeks at a}} time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E
5|$|Never Let Me Go {{was given}} a {{production}} budget of US$15 million. Principal photography for the film started in April 2009 and lasted a few weeks. Production design was done by Mark Digby, and Adam Kimmel was assigned to cinematography. The commercial director was Duncan Reid, who works for Ingenious Media, and the film was shot by crewmembers of the English company DNA Films. On 8 May 2009, the production moved to Norfolk for filming. The beach at Holkham is also featured in the film. Knightley previously shot scenes at nearby Holkham Hall for her 2008 film The Duchess. A location on Hill Road In Clevedon was used, and a shop was converted into a travel agency. They also filmed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> the Victorian pier in Clevedon. The pier is featured on the film poster and {{the cover of the}} rereleased book. A large property on the Bexhill-on-Sea seafront was used on 12 and 13 May 2009 to act as the exterior for the residence of Madame, where Tommy and Kathy go to apply for a deferral.|$|E
5|$|Ruby {{initially}} {{finds it}} hard to cope with her sister Charlie's relationship with Joey Collins (Kate Bell), but grows to accept it. Ruby decides to sleep with Xavier, they are caught by Ross who sends Ruby away for a while. Ruby learns Charlie had a secret child when she was young, she tries to track her down and is shocked when her Aunt Michelle tells her that Charlie knows who it is. Charlie reveals the truth, that Ruby is actually her daughter and that she became pregnant when Grant Bledcoe raped her. Charlie's parents agreed to bring Ruby up as their own. Ruby tracks Grant down and accuses him of ruining everyone's lives. Grant tells Ruby she has convinced herself it was not consented, Charlie then kidnaps Grant to get the truth. Grant later turns up dead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> Charlie and Ruby are in the frame for his murder, until Ross later admits he did it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> nearest to Setúbal {{are busy}} during summer months, {{especially}} at weekends. Stilted walkways link these <b>beaches</b> to <b>the</b> harbour <b>and</b> marina areas, protecting the vulnerable dune flora. There are small cafes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> larger ones around the marina near the foot-passenger ferry.|$|R
25|$|The harbor is {{an amazingly}} diverse and {{productive}} habitat. The following tables list {{in no particular}} order 94 examples of marine life that are regularly observed within the harbor.

5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion.

Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert hall}} was {{converted}} into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s. A funfair was added around the same time. By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties. In 1965, it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs. Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>and</b> the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns. The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation. The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley plays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>and</b> builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides {{him back to the}} caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} coastal erosion is {{compared}} against the so-called [...] "basic coastline" [...] (BasisKustLijn), the average coastline in 1990. Sand replenishment is used where beaches have retreated too far. About 12 million m3 of sand are deposited yearly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>and</b> below <b>the</b> waterline {{in front of}} the coast.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "caiçara" [...] {{comes from}} the Tupi {{language}} ka'aysá (or ka'aysara), a rustic fence made of tree branches.The fences would surround a village, or {{would be used for}} a fish trap.Over time it came to be used for <b>the</b> huts built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> <b>and</b> then for <b>the</b> inhabitants.|$|R
