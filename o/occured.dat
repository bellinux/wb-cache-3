25|$|Several movement-wide controversies have <b>occured</b> in Chabad's 200 year history.

Two other minor offshoot groups were formed later in the movement's history. The movement's other major controversy is Chabad messianism, which began in the 1990s. Chabad messianism appears to be among the most frequently cited controversies within the Orthodox Jewish community.|$|E
500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} <b>occured</b> off Pasir Ris MRT station. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally {{run over by}} an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked {{to go down to the}} tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E

500|$|The poem is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Faltonia Betitia Proba {{largely on the}} assertion of Isidore, who noted {{that it was the}} product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus (Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio ... expressit). However, the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was written by Anicia Faltonia Proba, a late-fourth- and early-fifth-century noblewoman and the granddaughter of Faltonia Betitia Proba. Shanzer and those who agree with her have developed the following arguments to support their claims: They argue that lines 13–17 of De laudibus Christi resemble lines 20–24 of the later poem Carmen contra paganos, reportedly written after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. They assert that the poem must have been written after 387, because it alludes to a debate about the date of Easter which took place that year. They see Jerome's allusion to the poem as a reference to a living individual (Anicia Proba) and contend that Faltonia Betitia Proba died during the war between Magnentius and Constantius, which <b>occured</b> in AD 351 and is alluded to in the invocation of De laudibus Christi. Finally, they argue that Anicia Proba must have written the poem, since the author is referred to as [...] "mother of the Anicians" [...] in a later manuscript and the [...] "eminent Roman Mistress" [...] in another (titles only Anicia Proba would have received).|$|E

6000|$|One {{circumstance}} <b>occured</b> at {{this time}} which shed a gleam of hope and consolation over his gloomy prospects. Diego de Deza, who had been for some time bishop of Palencia, was expected at court. This was the same worthy friar who had aided him to advocate his theory before the board of learned men at Salamanca, and had assisted him with his purse when making his proposals to the Spanish court. He had just been promoted and made archbishop of Seville, but {{had not yet been}} installed in office. Columbus directs his son Diego to intrust his interests to this worthy prelate. [...] "Two things," [...] says he, [...] "require particular attention. Ascertain whether the queen, who is now with God, has said any thing concerning me in her testament, and stimulate the bishop of Palencia, he who was the cause that their highnesses obtained possession of the Indies, who induced me to remain in Castile when I was on the road to leave it." [...] [230] In another letter he says, [...] "If the bishop of Palencia has arrived, or should arrive, tell him how much I have been gratified by his prosperity, and that if I come, I shall lodge with his grace, even though he should not invite me, for we must return to our ancient fraternal affection." ...|$|E

Then Mulford still apprehended Spike. In that remote part of the world, almost beyond the confines of society, it was not easy to foretell what claims he might set up, in the event of his meeting them there. Armed with the authority of a husband, Mulford could resist him, in any such case, with far better prospects of success than if he should appear only in the character of a suitor.|$|E
