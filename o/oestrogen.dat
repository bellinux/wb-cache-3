5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (<b>oestrogen</b> and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10â€“13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both <b>oestrogen</b> and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{biology and}} {{physiology}} {{of the male}} as well as female reproductive system is hormonally regulated. Abnormalities in the dynamics of hormone production, metabolism and elimination, {{as well as their}} binding to certain target tissues, has been associated with pathophysiological conditions of the reproductive system. Although <b>oestrogens</b> are known {{to be one of the}} major hormone groups in regulating the reproductive function and the fertilization process, the cellular and biochemical mechanism or mechanism(s) via which <b>oestrogens</b> induce their effects are still not fully defined. Moreover, in a modern environment we are also exposed to a wide battery of environmental agents which are structurally similar to <b>oestrogens,</b> and termed 'senvironmental oestrogens'. Because environmental <b>oestrogens</b> have been shown to mimic some of the effects of oestradiol, it has been postulated that these exogenous chemicals may influence or interfere with the oestrogen-dependent reproductive processes, and may be associated with beneficial as well as deleterious effects on the reproductive system. In this regard, two classes of environmental <b>oestrogens</b> have been widely studied, i. e. phyto-oestrogens (plant-derived dietary <b>oestrogens)</b> and xeno-oestrogens (industrial chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT, TCDD, dioxins, etc.). The main focus of this review is to provide an overview on the cellular and biochemical mechanism(s) by which xeno-oestrogens and phyto-oestrogens influence the oestrogen-dependent reproductive functions and induce their deleterious or protective effects on the reproductive syste...|$|R

25|$|HRT is {{available}} in various forms. It generally provides low dosages {{of one or more}} estrogens, and often also provides either progesterone or a chemical analogue, called a progestin. Testosterone may also be included. Some HRT treatments such as Livial contain Tibolone, an anabolic steroid, that has the properties of <b>oestrogen,</b> progestogen and testosterone. Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period.|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer risk}} is {{strongly}} related to several reproductive and hormonal factors, but {{the nature of the}} effects of endogenous <b>oestrogens</b> has been difficult to establish. Data are now available from several large prospective studies with biobanks of stored serum, enabling better characterization of the associations of endogenous <b>oestrogens,</b> and other endogenous hormones, with breast cancer risk. In postmenopausal women, relatively high serum concentrations of oestradiol are associated with a more than twofold increase in the risk for breast cancer, and this probably explains the increase in risk in obese postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women the data available on <b>oestrogens</b> are more limited and difficult to interpret due to the large variations in endogenous <b>oestrogens</b> during the menstrual cycle, but are compatible with a positive association between oestradiol and breast cancer risk. There is also evidence that breast cancer risk is positively associated with androgens, prolactin and insulin-like growth factor-I. Further data are required, with better assays and repeat measures, to provide more accurate estimates of risk and to clarify the role of <b>oestrogens</b> in premenopausal women and the roles of other endogenous hormones...|$|R
25|$|SERMs are a {{category}} of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body.

Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and {{reduces the risk of}} invasive breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|The vagina of the {{immature}} mouse {{has been}} cultured in biological and completely synthetic media for periods up to 72 hr. Growth and cornification of the epithelium {{occurred in the}} absence of <b>oestrogens,</b> and was not prevented by the addition of a number of hormones and vitamins to the medium. The significance of the results is discussed, with respect to the mechanism of action of <b>oestrogens.</b> Several workers have successfully grown parts of the genital tract in tissue culture, but only a few of these studies have been concerned with the action of <b>oestrogens.</b> Gaillard [1942] was able to stimulate the uterus and seminal vesicles of the rat with oestrone, whereas Emmens & Ludford [1940] failed to induce keratinization in expiants of rat vagina with oestradiol- 3 : 17 ^. Recently Biggers, Claringbold & Hardy [1956], Hardy, Biggers & Claringbold [1953] and Kahn [1954] have produced vaginal cornification in expiants from the mouse and rat respectively, by the addition of <b>oestrogens</b> to a culture medium consisting of embryo extract and fowl plasma.

30|$|The role of androgens in {{prostate}} cancer is obvious {{due to the}} fact that androgen signalling is the main regulator of prostate growth and function.

In addition, <b>oestrogens</b> play a crucial role in prostate cancer, especially in elder men in whom the overall ratio of <b>oestrogens</b> to androgens is increasing.

2500|$|One of the {{alternative}} explanations is that extended female sexuality is 'male-driven'. This hypothesis is theoretically based on male uncertainty regarding the fertility status of females. Although some physiological changes occur during the fertile period that may act as reliable indicators (e.g. the concentration of <b>oestrogen</b> can change female scent), most species have not evolved signals advertising fertility (e.g. sexual swellings). [...] Therefore, males {{will be unable to}} detect fertility with any precision. As a result, extended female sexuality is proposed as a male sexually selected trait. Males will pursue sexual access throughout the entirety of the ovarian cycle to increase their chances of impregnating the female. According to this hypothesis, females lack any benefit from this activity due to their inability to conceive, yet will be coerced by males to engage in sexual intercourse.|$|E

50|$|Apart from {{diagnosis}} and characterisation of cancers, {{there is also}} therapeutic value {{to the discovery of}} miR-92s involvement in essential cell physiology and in promoting cancer. Returning to our review of breast cancer, the isoform ERÎ²1 is well studied as having anti-proliferative effects and pro-apoptotic effects. We discussed that miR-92 targets and down regulates ERÎ²1, and evidence suggests that miR-92 is regulated by <b>oestrogen</b> which is upstream of the ERÎ²1. Evidence for this was demonstrated by growing MCF-7 cells in <b>oestrogen</b> depleted conditions and adding antagonists to the <b>oestrogen</b> receptors: Tamoxifen and E2. miR-92 was upregulated in response, suggesting that the likely oncogenic role for miR-92 in this context is inhibition of ERÎ²1 expression in the presence of <b>oestrogen.</b> Thus, a therapeutic strategy against breast cancer could be aimed at re-activating expression of ERÎ²1 through manipulation of miR-92 expression.|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} {{farm animal}} population is considerably {{larger than the}} human one in the United Kingdom, implying a possibly important contribution to the environmental load of steroid hormones entering water. To make comparisons {{on the amount of}} steroid hormones produced by the different livestock, information was gathered on the structure of the UK farm animal populations and the amount of hormones excreted by animals at each of their life stages. An individual normalised dairy cow excretes two orders of magnitude more, and a normalised pig excretes more than one order of magnitude more steroid <b>oestrogens</b> than a normalised human. In terms of excretion, the combined farm animal population (including sheep and poultry) probably generates around four times more <b>oestrogens</b> than the human population in the UK. The biggest contributor on the animal side is the relatively small dairy cow population. If steroid <b>oestrogens</b> behave like herbicides, in which a worst case loss to surface waters is around 1 %, then {{it could be argued that}} farm animals are responsible for 15 % of all the <b>oestrogens</b> in UK waters. When simulations were made with the MACRO pesticide leaching model, predicted concentrations for field drains failed to exceed 1 ng/L. The rapid biodegradation rates, and high sorption rates taken from the literature and used in the model suggested less than 0. 001 % of <b>oestrogens</b> would reach the field drains.
