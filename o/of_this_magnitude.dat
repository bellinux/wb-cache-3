5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude.</b> Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude</b> again.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude</b> would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} the correlating factor, a, we set {{the rate of}} return from the revenue process equal to the maximum rate of return for the system (from the second order derivative), which we assume behaves in a condition <b>of</b> unity. <b>This</b> vector <b>magnitude</b> factor correlates loan portfolio returns to those for the prospective loan (Bellalah 2001). The presence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> vector <b>magnitude</b> factor serves to produce the value of downside risks for each strategy. Appendix 4 derives this relationship.|$|R

5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude,</b> the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E

Several reports have indicated that two people may have died in the event, however these deaths remain unofficial. This event has helped to spark discussion of asteroid impact avoidance.|$|E
25|$|The high {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the {{earthquake}} {{can be attributed to}} the time it struck and how suddenly it struck, as well as to the quality and nature of building construction in China. The earthquake lacked the foreshocks that sometimes come with earthquakes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude.</b> It also struck at just before 4a.m., when most people were asleep and unprepared. Tangshan itself was thought to be in a region with a relatively low risk of earthquakes. Very few buildings had been built to withstand an earthquake, and the city lies on unstable alluvial soil. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Crew {{living on}} the International Space Station (ISS) are {{partially}} protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around {{the earth and the}} ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable. Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful solar flare ever recorded. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a flare <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude</b> could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, {{two senior}} {{intelligence}} officials told U.S. news media {{that they were}} highly confident that Vladimir Putin personally directed the operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. They said Putin's motives were a vendetta against Hillary Clinton {{and the desire to}} foment global distrust of the U.S. Putin became personally involved after Russia accessed the DNC, because such an operation required high government approval. U.S. officials said that under Putin's direction, the goals evolved from criticizing American democracy to attacking Clinton, and by the fall of 2016 to directly help Trump's campaign, because Putin thought he would ease economic sanctions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Obama foreign policy advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes agreed with this assessment, with Rhodes saying operations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude</b> required Putin's consent.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the DNA {{profiling}} system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the SGM+ DNA {{profiling system}} that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar {{power of discrimination}} (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals if using a full SGM+ profile). Figures <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>magnitude</b> are {{not considered to be}} statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.|$|E
