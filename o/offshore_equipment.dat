40|$|In this M. Sc. Thesis the Maintenance Management (MM) loop {{developed}} by the Norwegian Oil Directorate (now PSA) {{has been used as}} a basis. The model was developed during the "basic study for Maintenance Management" in 1998. The purpose with this thesis was to connect this MM loop with Condition Monitoring (CM) as a strategy. This thesis can be seen as divided into two main parts as the task description shows. The first part with focus on the MM loop and CM, and the second part with focus on a decision tool for determination of maintenance and logistic demand related to <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment.</b> First the influences of CM on the input and output parameters of the MM loop have been discussed. Here the input parameters are the resources in form of organization, materials and support documentation. The output parameters are risk level and regularity due to HSEQ and costs. A premise for implementing CM will be that the benefits from CM must exceed the extra input costs, and that CM overall will be a better strategy than conventional periodic maintenance. Then activities in each step of the loop related to CM have been detected and discussed. Also analysis tools that may be used to support these activities have been detected and described. The most important tool detected was Reliability centered maintenance (RCM). There is also performed an investigation on the flow of CM data from signal data to useful information used for planning and decision support with respect to maintenance and logistics. This flow diagram starts with CM and data from CM, goes through among others condition analysis, prediction of reliability and remaining useful life, and ends up with actual failure mechanisms and condition development from the planned maintenance actions. For the second main part of the thesis, first a typical maintenance regime for offshore separators today has been briefly described. Then there has been tried to develop a decision tool with main focus on going from goals and requirements to a maintenance program for general <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment.</b> This decision tool includes the most important aspects needed to take into consideration when evaluating if CM is feasible from both a technical and a cost point of view. At last the decision tool has been evaluated and discussed towards a separator case. The analysis results utilized here are mainly collected from the M. Sc. Thesis of Jørgen Houmstuen from last year. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} all the recent studies, the {{insulating}} materials employed for high voltage (HV) transformer manufacturing are still those in use since several decades. For the fluid insulation, mineral oil (MO) still dominates thanks to its excellent dielectric and cooling performances. Anyway, since it is a carcinogenic agent, the electric industry searched alternatives for applications where environmental concerns are of greater concern (e. g., <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment,</b> trains). In this context, many efforts have been done to study green uids, mostly natural and synthetic esters, to replace MO. However, green alternatives have a low resistance to electrical discharge propagation. Some researchers have started to experiment with MO-based nano uids (i. e., colloidal solutions of nanoparticles in a base fluid), with the aim of improving the MO heat exchange capabilities. They have started to study nano fluids because of their outstanding thermal properties, but these fluids should be excellent also regarding all the electrical properties, ranging from the power losses to the discharge propagation resistance. Target of this thesis is to perform a fundamental study aimed at understanding if nanofluids are a real possible alternative for mineral oil...|$|E

40|$|The reuse of oil {{platforms}} {{remains a}} problem that does not yet have a solution, except for either removing or completely restoring them. This {{is especially true for}} offshore rigs in the Mediterranean and generally for the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, where only a few initiatives have been undertaken to reuse parts for the exploitation of new fields. New industrial technology and new environmental policies increase the possibility of developing other ways of decommissioning, with intrinsic social and environmental benefits. An industrial reuse of <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment</b> could involve the injection and storage of CO 2, one of the main greenhouse gases, as a tool in negotiating the future trading in greenhouse gas credits. An important role in reuse could be furthered by Gas To Liquids (GTL) technology, which allows the extraction of marginal gas reserves. The continuous technological developments and improved equipment have led to ever smaller plants, which can therefore be mounted on offshore platforms. Based on this premise we have analysed two case studies, brought together in conclusion which could further future research for these kind of reuse. Last, but not least, the possibility of mounting GPS stations will be discussed, potentially on monotubular platforms, without neglecting the need for maintenance, which in this case is relevant...|$|E
40|$|Although {{used for}} the station-keeping of <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment</b> for several decades, {{synthetic}} ropes have only recently been used for marine renewable energy (MRE) devices. The fundamental mooring load differences between these two applications necessitate the detailed quantification of mooring component performance. Of particular importance for lifecycle analysis, installation and maintenance operations is the evolution of synthetic component performance over time due to load history and fatigue mechanisms. Changes to the stiffness and damping properties of these materials will affect the global response of the device if the mooring system and device responses are closely coupled. To address these uncertainties, tension experiments have been conducted on Nylon parallel-stranded rope samples at IFREMER {{as part of a}} MERiFIC (Marine Energy in Far Peripheral and Island Communities) consortium. Measurements are reported from tests involving three new samples subjected to a mixed creep/relaxation and harmonic loading regime. Different initial bedding-in levels are used to investigate the influence of load history on the immediate quasi-static and dynamic properties of the rope. For the load regimes studied, it is found that the rope condition with respect to the load-strain characteristic has a strong influence on the performance of the line.

40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of Depreciation at Will (DAW) on offshore gas production, government budget and employment in the gas industry. The DAW enables firms to accelerate deprecation of investments in platforms and other <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment.</b> The interest advantage due to the postponed payments of taxes raises the profitability of investment projects and, hence, could {{raise the level of}} investments. The key question in the debate on the DAW is whether the higher tax base compensates for the interest losses due to postponed tax receipts. The econometric analysis has shown that the DAW increased only the number of development drillings during the period this measure was implemented (1996 - 2002). A moving long-run average of the oil price has appeared to be a significantly explaining variable behind the level of exploration drillings as well as development drillings. Using the current value of that oil price, 25 dollar per barrel, we find a large number of profitable exploration projects. In the current circumstances, introduction of the DAW will not raise the level of investments in the near future, as several non-financial factors appear to be bottlenecks, such as the duration of licensing procedures. The econometric analysis is also published in A. ten Cate en M. Mulder, 2007, "Impact of the oil price and fiscal facilities on offshore mining at the Dutch Continental Shelf", Energy Policy, vol 35, pp 5601 - 5613. ...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} focus on the environmental impact and energy consumption of {{the oil and gas}} industry. In <b>offshore</b> drilling <b>equipment,</b> electric motors tend to replace traditionally used hydraulic motors, especially in rotational motion control applications. However, force densities available from linear hydraulic actuators are still typically higher than those of electric actuators. Therefore, usually the remaining source of hydraulic power is thereby the hydraulic cylinder. This paper presents a feasibility study on the implementation of an electromechanical cylinder drivetrain on an offshore vertical pipe handling machine. The scope {{of this paper is to}} investigate the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf drivetrain. With a focus on the motion performance, numerical modeling and simulation are used when sizing and selecting the components of the considered electromechanical cylinder drivetrain. The simulation results are analyzed and discussed together with a literature study regarding advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution considering the design criteria of <b>offshore</b> drilling <b>equipment.</b> It is concluded that the selected drivetrain can only satisfy the static motion requirements since the required transmitted power is higher than the recommended permissible power of the transmission screw. Consequently, based on the recommendation of the manufacturer, avoidance of overheating cannot be guaranteed for the drivetrain combinations considered for the case study presented in this paper. Hence, to avoid overheating, the average speed of the motion cycle must be decreased. Alternatively, external cooling or temperature monitoring and control system that prevents overheating could be implemented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis report {{presents}} {{details of}} one aspect, namely, the flexible riser pipe pickup system, {{of a proposed}} ship-based carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) method. The liquefied CO 2 (LCO 2) to be sequestered is directly injected into subseabed geological formations through a flexible riser pipe using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO 2 carrier ship. The flexible riser pipe remains on the seabed, one end attached to the injection wellhead, until the other end is hoisted up and connected to the (dynamic positioning system (DPS) -controlled) LCO 2 carrier ship arriving at the ocean injection site. This proposed system has various advantages {{over the use of}} stationary sea surface structures for ship mooring and CO 2 injection: i) no need for stationary sea surface structures, e. g., ship-mooring-buoy or platform; ii) simplifies ship handling, especially in rougher sea states; and iii) the flexible riser pipe can remain on the seabed in rough seas. Details of a pickup buoy system for retrieving the riser from the seabed and the structure of the flexible riser pipe are presented in this paper. The riser pickup system consists basically of shipboard equipment such as a coupling valve, crane, winches and A-frame and <b>offshore</b> <b>equipment</b> such as a pickup buoy, pickup float, messenger line, sinker and pickup wire rope.
