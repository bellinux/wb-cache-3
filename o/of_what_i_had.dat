It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E

[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt against the backdrop <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, {{this kind of work}} was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{soldiers}} derided {{the attempts}} {{that were made}} to indoctrinate them, but the British public was more susceptible. Philip Gibbs, a fellow war correspondent, noted {{that he and his}} colleagues [...] "identified absolutely with the Armies in the field... There was no need of censorship in our despatches. We were our own censors." [...] The journalistic support for the cause was appreciated by military commanders such as Douglas Haig, who saw the propaganda generated by the correspondents {{as an integral part of}} the Allies' efforts. Haig eventually went so far as to ask Gibbs and Beach Thomas to produce his own weekly news-sheet. Public opinion at home may have been mollified, even uplifted, by the efforts of the correspondents but the troops were not, despite the high demand among them for newspapers from home. One soldier, Albert Rochester, was court martialled for attempting to send to the Daily Mail a letter that stated the realities as he saw them and was critical of Beach Thomas's work, noting the [...] "ridiculous reports regarding the love and fellowship existing between officers and men." [...] Beach Thomas himself later regretted his wartime reports of the Somme, saying, [...] "I was thoroughly and deeply ashamed <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written for the good reason that it was untrue... the vulgarity of enormous headlines and the enormity of one's own name did not lessen the shame." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 1 January 1821 - With the {{beginning}} of a New Year- I commence a journal of ephemeral events.- a kind of record of my hours of application and of rest - to look at in after days.- trusting that the contemplation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done may serve to remind me <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do and the consideration <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not may stimulate me to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do.|$|R
2500|$|... "I avoided {{working with}} other people for many years, partly out of paranoia, and partly out of an earnest desire to stand on my own. After a while, I got tired of {{thinking}} that way, and it just seemed natural to do the opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done before. [...] I like making music with other people. I can still make music by myself too.".|$|E
2500|$|Simon Hoggart, {{writing in}} The Guardian, related an anecdote of Soames' childhood: [...] "He {{gave me the}} true version <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always {{suspected}} was an apocryphal story. In or around 1953, when Soames was five, he didn't know how important his grandfather was until someone told him. So {{he walked up to}} the old man's bedroom, managed to get past the valets and the secretaries, and found him sitting up in bed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unemployment}} rate was about 25% and higher in major industrial and mining centers. Farm income had fallen by over 50% since 1929. An estimated 844,000 non-farm mortgages had been foreclosed between 1930–33, {{out of five}} million in all. Political and business leaders feared revolution and anarchy. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who remained wealthy during the Depression, stated years later that, [...] "in those days I felt and said I {{would be willing to}} part with half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> if I could be sure of keeping, under law and order, the other half".|$|E

2500|$|Aaron {{was also}} {{mentioned}} by Muhammad in likeness to ‘Ali. Muhammad had left ‘Ali {{to look after}} his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found ‘Ali a burden and was relieved {{to be rid of}} his presence. ‘Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the Prophet said: [...] "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O ‘Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Akin {{later wrote}} a book, Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom (published July 2014), {{in which he}} stated that he regretted apologizing for these remarks, because, [...] "by asking {{the public at large}} for forgiveness, I was validating the willful {{misinterpretation}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said." [...] He said that he meant [...] "legitimate rape" [...] as an abbreviated form of [...] "legitimate case of rape". He also reiterated that he believed a woman's body would prevent conception if she had been raped, due to impact of stress on fertilization. He criticized members of his party for disavowing him, including Karl Rove, former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer, Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John McCain, Roy Blunt, and Lindsey Graham, and House Speaker John Boehner, and what he referred to as the [...] "liberal media" [...] for supposed double standards, comparing his candidacy to that of George Allen, derailed due to Allen's use of a racist slur.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly {{she lifted}} her great earnest eyes fearlessly to my own. They were full of light and happiness. I doubted no longer that she was {{innocent}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> imagined.|$|E
60|$|I {{might have}} pitied this {{deformed}} woman--such {{a longing for}} love broke suddenly through the menace of her eyes. But then I thought <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone through, and my heart set like flint.|$|E
