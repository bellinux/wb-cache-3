2500|$|Soon after 2:35a.m., {{a man who}} {{was later}} given the {{pseudonym}} Alan Masters was driving through an intersection {{a few blocks from the}} park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle that sped through the intersection without its headlights activated as the driver ignored a red light. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face, dark, long, stringy hair, several days' growth of dark whiskers on his face, and wearing a blue jacket. Masters was upset and he neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought that it might have been a New Jersey rather than a New York plate. Violante encountered a very similar man, because he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before they were shot. Violante described him as a [...] "grubby-looking hippy" [...] with whiskers, wiry hair <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> dark eyes, and wearing a denim jacket.|$|E
60|$|James Vont {{passed his}} hand a little wearily <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Kirk Winfield {{passed a}} hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> left <b>forehead</b> and {{followed}} her. Like George, he found Mrs. Porter a trifle overwhelming.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!' He {{passed a}} wet hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> streaky <b>forehead.</b> 'Wasn't there a bicycle {{that was the}} {{beginning}} of this trouble?' said he.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{the pain}} so very bad?' {{she said in}} her soft voice, putting her hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> hot <b>forehead,</b> in the way that Alfred liked.|$|R
60|$|Adrian {{clasped his}} hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> {{and leaned against the}} table.|$|E
60|$|He paused {{while he}} passed his {{handkerchief}} once more <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sandy (passing {{his hand}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead).</b> You did wrong, Miss Mary.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know; I can't understand,' said Leonard, passing <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> weary <b>forehead.</b> 'Why {{could they}} not believe when I told them {{just how it}} was?' ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{going up}} to him, she bent <b>over,</b> kissed <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> and went out. The warmth from her lips, and the scent of her {{remained}} with Winton like a sensation wafted from the past.|$|R
60|$|Jethro replied by {{stepping}} forward, {{taking the}} girl's hand, and bending <b>over</b> it until <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> touched it.|$|R
60|$|Laurence {{passed his}} hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> {{and sat down}} on the bed.|$|E
60|$|Lord St. Simon {{sank into}} a chair and passed his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Heron {{had sunk}} into a chair. He passed a {{trembling}} hand {{once or twice}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom?" [...] {{said the}} old man, startled {{for a moment and}} passing <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{wrinkled}} <b>forehead.</b> [...] "Whom? Eh! Why, the Dona Maruja and the little black cat--her maid--Faquita!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He shuddered, he {{knew not}} why, and passed <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> high <b>forehead.</b> [...] "Yes, I go there very often," [...] he replied vacantly. [...] "But you, mademoiselle--you--I have met before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are very}} kind,' said Mr Dorrit. 'Truly kind.' By {{this time the}} visitor was seated, and was passing <b>his</b> great hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{exhausted}} <b>forehead.</b> 'You are well, I hope, Mr Merdle?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'After all, a schoolmaster's {{life does}} not tend to mend the temper,' {{concluded}} James, sighing, and passing his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} Giant felt quite like himself and insisted upon leaving off the bandage {{that had been}} placed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON. Those steps make me giddy. (He passes {{his hand}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.)</b> I have not got over that infernal gas yet.|$|E
6000|$|Firmin {{adjusted}} a strap, {{passed a}} hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> wet <b>forehead,</b> and followed earnestly. 'I admit, sir,' {{he said to}} a receding back, 'that {{there has to be}} some sort of hegemony, some sort of Amphictyonic council----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, dear, hush!" [...] {{said his}} wife in a {{soothing}} voice, passing her cool hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> heated <b>forehead.</b> [...] "This is Doctor Easterling, from Stranraer. He has not come to harm you, but to do you good." ...|$|R
60|$|Dom Pedro's eyes glistened as he {{clutched}} at the scroll handed him, then, though he first burned it <b>over</b> the lamp, <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> grew furrowed, and his jaw fell.|$|R
60|$|For {{several minutes}} he {{remained}} quiet, trying {{to collect his}} thoughts. Then {{he sat up and}} passed one hand slowly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Violet {{decided that}} {{his smile was}} very {{becoming}} to him and that she liked the way his dark hair grew <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Was it {{death that}} spread the livid pallor <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and his cheeks, and the dull leaden hue on his eyelids and his lips? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{give you}} my word, Atkinson, that I {{have not had a}} drain for two days. It's not drink. I don't know what it is. I suppose you think this is drink." [...] He took up my hand in his burning grasp, and passed it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Your servant, sir," [...] says Mr. George with a {{military}} salute. Good-humouredly smiling all <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>forehead</b> up into <b>his</b> crisp hair, he then defers to Miss Flite, as, with great stateliness, and at some length, she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation. He winds it up with another [...] "Your servant, sir!" [...] and another salute.|$|R
60|$|Father Pedro {{watched the}} disappearing {{figure of the}} muleteer and hurriedly swept his thin, dry hand, veined and ribbed like a brown November leaf, <b>over</b> <b>his</b> stony <b>forehead,</b> with a sound that seemed almost a rustle. Then he {{suddenly}} stiffened <b>his</b> fingers <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breviary, dropped his arms perpendicularly before him, and with a rigid step returned to the corridor and passed into the sacristy.|$|R
60|$|Chauvelin had paused, half-choked {{by his own}} emotion, his {{hatred and}} {{prospective}} revenge. He passed his handkerchief <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> which was streaming with perspiration.|$|E
6000|$|M. de Bellegarde {{looked down}} at his mother, passing his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> and then, tenderly, caressingly, [...] "What shall I say?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|New {{acknowledgments}} from Mr Dorrit. New {{passages of}} Mr Merdle's hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Calm and silence. Contemplation of Mr Dorrit's waistcoat buttons by Mr Merdle.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} answer. Shall {{you have time}} with all your other work? Poetry I beg pardon {{medicine}} is very absorbing, you know," [...] answered Rose mischievously, for just then, as he stood bareheaded {{in the shadows of}} the leaves playing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> fine <b>forehead,</b> she remembered the chat among the haycocks, and he did not look at all like an M.D.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, is it, lovely charmer," [...] said Allen, like an Ottoman, bowing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad, bovine <b>forehead,</b> and {{breathing}} {{the words out}} like a lute; [...] "it is he--Ethan Allen, the soldier; now, since ladies' eyes visit him, made trebly a captive." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had passed}} <b>his</b> hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> yellow <b>forehead</b> and considered, {{as if he}} were not sure about it. Something to eat was proposed. 'No, thank you,' said Mr Merdle, 'I don't feel {{inclined}} for it. I was to have dined out along with Mrs Merdle. But as I didn't feel inclined for dinner, I let Mrs Merdle go by herself just as we were getting into the carriage, and thought I'd take a stroll instead.' ...|$|R
