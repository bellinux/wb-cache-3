5|$|Captain Daniel Bray, {{along with}} Captain Jacob Gearhart and Captain Jacob Ten Eyck, were chosen by General George Washington {{to take charge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> used in the crossing, supervising the {{transport}} of infantry, cavalry, cannon, and howitzers.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy's 1 February 1913 order, {{the first}} two boats, U-7 and U-8, were laid down at Germaniawerft on 1 November. U-9 was laid {{down at the end}} of December, and the final two boats, U-10 and U-11 were both begun in February 1914. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> was slated to be {{complete}} within 29 to 33 months.|$|E
5|$|Forty leagues (120nautical {{miles or}} around 220km) {{to the east}} of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and {{barnacles}} from the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> in a process known as careening, necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates.|$|E
50|$|In rowing, stroke is <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> {{propelling}} <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> with oars, {{and also}} a rower seated closest to <b>the</b> stern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> <b>The</b> stroke side is <b>the</b> port side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{seven points}} along <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> {{thickness}} gauges were cut, usually at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Those holes were bored {{from outside the}} log after <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was formed. <b>The</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holes equated to <b>the</b> required thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> bottom. In <b>the</b> Hasholme logboat, however, the thickness gauges were bored not at the bottom but at <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bilge, and later corked by oak tree-nails.|$|R

"You see," [...] said he, [...] "that when I {{move the}} tiller over this way, then <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> turns <b>the</b> other way; and when I move it over that way, then <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> comes round this way. <b>The</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> always goes <b>the</b> {{contrary}} way." ...|$|R
5|$|Germanicus {{sent some}} troops {{back to the}} Rhine, {{with some of them}} taking the land route, but most of them took the fast route and {{traveled}} by boat. They went down the Ems toward the North Sea, but as they reached the sea, a storm struck, sinking many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and killing many men and horses.|$|E
5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced {{that it would be}} impossible to take delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|On July15, the {{hurricane}} moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105mph (165km/h), or a Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric pressure {{was estimated at}} 969mbar (28.61inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either lost or wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July16 after progressing further inland.|$|E
50|$|After {{nearly a}} month of {{excavation}} 9.5 metres <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was eventually recovered. Depending on different views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete <b>boat</b> this 9.5 metres could be up to two thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Metacentre is {{determined}} by the ratio between <b>the</b> inertia resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> (<b>The</b> inertia resistance is a quantified description <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> waterline width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> resists overturning.) Wide and shallow or narrow and deep hulls have high transverse metacenters (relative to the keel), and the opposite have low metacenters; the extreme opposite is shaped like a log or round bottomed boat.|$|R

5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began to lay a plan of attack.|$|E
5|$|Shortages {{of skilled}} {{shipyard}} workers and materials slowed construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> {{and as a}} result, neither {{of the first two}} boats was ever launched, much less completed. The second pair was cancelled before either was laid down. U-50 was 90% complete at war's end, while U-51 was only 60% complete. Both boats had been scrapped in place in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew {{tried hard to}} {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{difficulty}} in sailing this <b>boat</b> is <b>the</b> tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to 'pitchpole' when running downwind; the sail plan and distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hulls {{is such that}} it can push the bows down far enough to dip them under the water, stopping <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and leading to a cartwheel or somersault and subsequent capsize <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Sailors compensate for this by putting their weight as far aft as they can while running downwind. Raking <b>the</b> mast aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centreline also reduces this motion and can improve the windward sailing ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several key {{components}} make up <b>the</b> main structure <b>of</b> most <b>boats.</b> <b>The</b> hull {{is the main}} structural component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and provides buoyancy. The gunnel, which make up <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> offers protection from water and makes <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> harder to sink. The roughly horizontal, chambered structures spanning <b>the</b> hull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{are referred to as}} the deck. A ship often has several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any. Above the deck are the superstructures. <b>The</b> underside <b>of</b> a deck is the deck head.|$|R
50|$|Second Stroke (3) - {{the next}} seat {{away from the}} bow and {{probably}} the seat closest to <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> their main role is to stabilise <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Their oar is on <b>the</b> same side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> as <b>the</b> bow rower.|$|R
5|$|U-23 was {{launched}} on 5 January 1917, but It {{is not known}} with certainty when U-23 was commissioned. Author Paul Halpern reports that U-23 and her three sisters all entered service between August and November 1917. Although there are no specific reports of problems with U-23, the U-20 class as a whole suffered from unreliable engines which compounded the poor handling characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
5|$|During their active service, {{the boats}} of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor handling characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> None {{of the class}} had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk when she went down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive paravane in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E

50|$|There are two {{configurations}} of an inboard, V-drive and direct drive. A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> with <b>the</b> propeller shaft straight out the back, where a V-drive has the powerplant mounted in <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> facing backwards having the shaft go towards <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> then making a V towards the rear.

5|$|Hichens was {{recommended}} for the Victoria Cross {{for his actions}} during the night of 27/28 February. When informed by his commanding officer, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only {{for it to be}} resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, Admiral Lyon (the Commander-in-chief at Nore) and Rear Admiral Rogers (the Flag officer in charge at Harwich). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given.|$|E
5|$|Late {{in their}} careers, {{the class was}} {{identified}} as the A class and the pennant numbers of all the submarines were prefixed with an A, becoming A-2 to A-7. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> however, ever displayed an A on their conning towers. Havmanden and Thetis were the first two boats taken out of service when they were stricken in April 1928. Havfruen was the last boat removed from service when she was stricken in May 1932.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{ordered his}} first lieutenant, Henry Parkyns Hoppner, to take Lord Amherst {{and his party}} in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> to an island, known today as Pulo Leat, three miles away. The island's thick {{vegetation}} prevented an assessment of whether it was inhabited, and forced the boat crews to row a further three miles along the shore before finding a suitable landing spot between the mangroves. The rest of the ship's company were evacuated in the remaining boats and a large raft. Because {{of the lack of}} provisions, in particular drinking water, it was decided that Hoppner would continue with Amherst and his embassy to Java, roughly 200 miles to the south. Once there, a rescue could be initiated.|$|E

As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E
5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), {{kept up a}} constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was {{supervised by}} marine architect Alan L. Bates (now Captain Bates), whose book, Str.

5000|$|Stomp - The stomp is {{used when}} landing a drop {{such as a}} {{waterfall}} and <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> is too flat (that is, <b>the</b> nose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> is nearly level with the stern) which can result in very high impact flat landings.
