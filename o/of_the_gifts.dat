5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to the Franciscans, the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza {{province of the}} Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was {{at war with the}} Itza king. The Chak'an Itzas carried off most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>the</b> assimilation/acculturation <b>of</b> <b>gift</b> giving {{behaviors among}} U. S. immigrants. Through {{a series of}} in-depth interviews and group encounters, with respondents from several different countries, these gifting behaviors are examined within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a baby shower. This research highlights the difficulty that immigrants have in adapting to gift-giving behaviors considered sacred such as <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> giving and <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift.</b> Further, sacred gifts are identified as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main areas in which immigrants are unwilling to acculturate because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implications for the baby’s well-being. In addition, this research suggests that immigrants will assimilate <b>the</b> gift-giving behaviors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority culture when they live in areas with fewer members of their community. Thus, assimilated/acculturated behaviors are impacted by: 1) immigrant group size and 2) <b>the</b> sacredness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> giving behavior...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{gift from}} an anthropological {{perspective}} {{differs from the}} rigid civil notion of donation, which presupposes an unilateral, gratuitous transfer {{from one person to}} another. <b>The</b> anthropological notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> includes all gratuitous transfers, either material or non-material.

40|$|Gifting (or gift-giving) is a {{particularly}} interesting form of communication that envelops both material and social dimensions. Objects are transformed into gifts through particular socio-material practices. While these practices are, of course, interesting in themselves, this paper will {{take a step back}} and revisit attempts to define and theorize <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> as a concept. In a time when <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> economy is often called upon as a potential candidate for more “participatory alternatives to capitalist totality”, particularly in relation to theorizing of labour on and through <b>the</b> Internet, theories <b>of</b> <b>gifting</b> provide an important foundation for discussing <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> alternative futures and economies. 			So far, little effort has been taken to advance gift theory into a new materialist or posthumanist thinking. In an attempt to take that first step, this paper provides two contributions. First, it highlights how feminist theorizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> comprises interesting forerunners in a new materialist conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift.</b> Second, it explores the analytical traction that can be gained from interlocking theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift,</b> feminist materialism and digital media, the result being a conceptual model that addresses <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> as a form of virtual-digital-material communication...|$|R
