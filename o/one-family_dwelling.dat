40|$|This article elaborates on {{the design}} and {{economic}} evaluation {{of a system that}} provides electricity for an average <b>one-family</b> <b>dwelling</b> by utilizing solar energy. Solar energy is converted by photovoltaic arrays to electricity which is then used for the electrolysis of water. The hydrogen produced is stored in the form of hydride and can be used either for direct burning, to meet the thermal energy requirements, or in a fuel cell to supply the electric energy needed. Particular emphasis was given to designing a control system that could guarantee a smooth intermittent operation of the electrolytic unit and the utilization of the maximum output of the photovoltaic cells. The system selected can operate with minimum attendance and very little maintenance. However, the cost of the electricity produced is at present prohibitive, being as high as $ 3. 30 k Wh- 1. © 1982...|$|E
40|$|A photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) {{panel is}} a {{combination}} of photovoltaic cells with a solar thermal collector, generating solar electricity and solar heat simultaneously. Hence, PVT panels are an alternative for a combination of separate PV panels and solar thermal collectors. A promising system concept, consisting of 25 m 2 of PVT panels and a ground coupled heat pump, has been simulated in TRNSYS. It has been found that this system is able to cover 100 % of the total heat demand for a typical newly-built Dutch <b>one-family</b> <b>dwelling,</b> while covering nearly all of its own electricity use and keeping the long-term average ground temperature constant. The cost of such a system has been compared to the cost of a reference system, where the PVT panels have been replaced with separate PV panels (26 m 2) and solar thermal collectors (7 m 2), but which is otherwise identical. The electrical and thermal yield of this reference system is equal to that of the PVT system. It has been found that both systems require a nearly identical initial investment. Finally, a view on future PVT markets is given. In general, the residential market {{is by far the most}} promising market. The system discussed in this paper is expected to be most successful in newly-built low-energy housing concepts...|$|E
5000|$|A zoning {{ordinance}} in the Village of Belle Terre restricted <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings</b> {{to single}} family, which {{was defined as}} [...] "one or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit" [...] or two people unrelated by blood or marriage.|$|R
50|$|Frohnhofen {{takes the}} shape of a clump village whose streets meet in the village core in an almost star-shaped pattern. Still {{standing}} here are a few bigger farmhouses. Otherwise, <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings</b> dominate the built-up area. The great multipurpose hall, the Bürgerzentrum (“Civic Centre”) with its village fountain stands on the road to Altenkirchen, while the former schoolhouse is found on Schulstraße (“School Street”).|$|R
50|$|There {{are quite}} a number of open areas around the town, mainly used for agriculture. Residential areas are {{characterized}} by <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings.</b> There are no genuine highrises in town. With the completion of the Schüttorfer Kreuz (“Schüttorf Cross”), an Autobahn cloverleaf formed by the A 30 and the A 31, greater commercial and industrial areas were laid out in the town’s northeast near this interchange in 2004 and 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Arthur Suburban Home Company {{purchased}} a 150 acre farm in 1891 and converted {{it into a}} subdevelopment of <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings,</b> starting a transformation of the community from rural to suburban. Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). Scarsdale High School and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918. The first store in Scarsdale opened {{on the corner of}} Popham Road and Garth Road in 1912. By 1915, the population approached 3000. By 1930, that number approached 10,000.|$|R
50|$|Huge sects of land (over 7-70 acres each) were allotted by the DDA {{to private}} societies. These societies, then made roads (within their {{respective}} land) and erected other essential amenities by themselves and allotted plots to members. The kothis {{of the areas}} are in these colonies. Plot sizes here ranges from 164-500 square yards, with 200 being a common size. Post 2008, following a change in MCD rules, {{the concept of a}} builder floors here has really taken off, where these bungalows are being converted to 4-floor building in which different floors accommodate different families as against other bungalows which are <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The land developed by DDA has no such bungalows or builder floors.|$|R

5000|$|Historically {{the term}} {{garrison}} means 1) {{a group of}} soldiers; 2) a defensive structure; 3) {{the location of a}} group of soldiers is assigned such as garrison house or garrison town. [...] "The term garrison refers to the military or defensive character of a house" [...] but not as heavily built as a blockhouse. [...] "Garrisons, or fortified houses, were built in almost all New England towns and they were particularly common in the frontier towns of Maine and New Hampshire...Like an ordinary house in plan and appearance, garrisons were used in times of peace as <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings,</b> but were strongly built and capable of protecting a number of families in times of danger." [...] Construction methods typically used log walls or thick planks with a timber frame construction called plank frame construction or simply a plank house.|$|R
50|$|In 1941 {{there were}} a total of 341 lots, 27 of which were vacant; of the 314 lots that were extant, 198 {{consisted}} of wood structures. Wooden buildings were rarely built after the Great Fire of New York in 1835, and brick became the popular building material around the 1870s, indicating that these framed houses were likely over a century old and were probably built without running water or sometimes even electricity. Prior to demolition, there was still an active neighborhood, with 144 stores that were occupied and 30 unoccupied, as well as 677 apartments, 33 <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and 61 two-family dwellings whose occupants needed to be relocated. There were a total of approximately 970 families to be relocated. The area consisted of 18 smaller blocks divided by roads and small alleyways. Eight streets—Talman Street, Charles Street, High Street, Prospect Street, Dixon Place, Fern Place and Greene Lane—were destroyed by the joining of these smaller blocks when demolition started in 1945. Hudson Avenue was cut off between Front and York Street and diverted over to Navy Street.|$|R
50|$|Settlements here started {{around the}} late 1970s and 1980s, thus {{this is a}} {{relatively}} old and green area. The east side was 'mostly' developed by the DDA where blocks were A, B, and C-blocks were formed and plots were allotted along with flats in Group Housings. The west side is 'mostly' privately developed. Huge sects of land (over 7-70 acres each) were allotted by the DDA to private societies on both sides. These societies, then made roads (within their respective land) and erected other essential amenities by themselves and allotted plots to members. Most of the kothis (apart from the ones in A, B, and C-block) of the areas are in these colonies. Plot sizes here ranges from 164-500 square yards, with 200 being a common size. Post-2008, following a change in MCD rules, {{the concept of a}} builder floors here has really taken off, where these bungalows are being converted to 4-floor building in which different floors accommodate different families as against other bungalows which are <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The land developed by DDA has no such bungalows or builder floors.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{understanding}} of the complex relationship between the home environment, well-being and daily functioning in the third age is currently weak. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the methodological background of the Home and Health in the Third Age Study, and describe a sample of men and women in relation to their home and health situation. Methods and Design: The study sample included 371 people aged 67 – 70, living in ordinary housing in the south of Sweden. Structured interviews and observations were conducted to collect data about objective and perceived aspects of home and health. Results: The majority of the participants were in good health and had few functional limitations. Women had more functional limitations and reported more symptoms than men. Environmental barriers were found in every home investigated; the most were found in the kitchen and hygiene area. Environmental barriers were more common in multi-family than in <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings.</b> Discussion: This study will increase our knowledge on home and health dynamics among people in the third age. The results have potential to contribute to societal planning related to housing provision, home care and social services for senior citizens...|$|R
50|$|Hexenberg, {{whose name}} is German for “Witches’ Mountain”, is a {{constituent}} community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low <b>one-family</b> and multiple-family <b>dwellings</b> {{as well as a}} few smaller shops {{in the middle of the}} community.|$|R
5000|$|One {{year after}} the eagle feather decision, the Court decided Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). In Agins the Court stated that the {{application}} of land-use regulations to a particular piece of property is a taking when it denies the land's owner reasonable, viable use of it, or [...] "if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests … or denies an owner economically viable use of his land." [...] After landowners had acquired 5 acre of unimproved land in a city for residential development, the city was required by California law to prepare a general plan governing land use {{and the development of}} open-space land. In response, the city adopted zoning ordinances that placed the owners’ property in a zone in which property may be devoted to <b>one-family</b> <b>dwellings,</b> accessory buildings, and open-space uses, with density restrictions permitting appellants to build between one and five single-family residences on their tract. The city expressed its intention to acquire the Agins parcel for open space, and actually commenced condemnation proceedings to take title to it. Later, the city abandoned the condemnation, and adopted the ordinance in issue. Without having sought approval for development of their tract under the ordinances, appellants brought suit against the city in state court, alleging that the city had taken their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The California Supreme Court departed from long-standing California precedent and held that monetary compensation was not available in regulatory taking cases which the court refused to recognize. That holding was eventually overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court a few years later in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987).|$|R
