40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{aspects of}} {{a new type of}} piezo-resistive pressure sensors for environments with rapidly changing temperatures are presented. The idea is that the sensor has two identical diaphragms which have different coefficients of linear thermal expansion. Therefore, when measuring pressure in environments with variable temperature, the diaphragms will have different deflection. This difference {{can be used to make}} appropriate correction of the sensor output signal and, thus, to increase accuracy of measurement. Since physical principles of sensors <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> fast correction of the output signal, the sensor can be used in environments with rapidly changing temperature, which is its essential advantage. The paper presents practical implementation of the proposed theoretical aspects and the results of testing the developed sensor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A {{wide range}} of new {{applications}} have recently appeared for a low power, low cost, “embedded radio”. These wireless interfaces for handheld mobile nodes and Wireless Integrated Network Sensors (WINS) must provide spread spectrum signaling for multi-user operation at 902 - 928 MHz. Conventional low power RF systems have been implemented in bipolar technology. However, cost considerations motivate the development of complete micropower CMOS RF circuits and systems operating at previously unexplored low power levels. Micropower CMOS VCO and mixer circuits, developed for these emerging narrow-band communication systems, are reported here. Design methods combining high-Q inductors and weak inversion MOSFET <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the lowest reported operating power for RF front end components including a mixer and voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) operating at frequencies of 400 - 900 MHz.

NIST in the beginning selected Rijndael within October 2000 and formal adoption as being the AES standard started in December 2001. FIPS PUB 197 explains a 128 -bit block cipher making Ause of a 128, 192, or 256 -bit key. In cryptography, modes of <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the repeated and secure use of a block cipher under a single key. This paper presents implementation of multi mode AES algorithm with three modes ECB, CBC and CTR modes. All these three modes are implemented with 128 -bit plain text and 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit key lengths. Each program results are verified with ModelSim PE and are synthesized in Xilinx ISE 9. 2 i. These results are also useful for implementing hardware.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Filtration and Separation [© Elsevier]. Of the various fine particle/liquid separation techniques available to the process engineer the most commonly used are variants of filtration, expression and sedimentation. Their simple concept and apparent ease of <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the efficient separation of many solid/liquid systems. However, the separation of finer, near colloidal sized, particle suspensions using these techniques frequently poses problems which have undesirable consequences. For example, on occasions the wetness of filter cakes can be inexplicably high, with the result that thermal drying is the only viable method by which the required moisture removal can be achieved. With cost increases of energy forever pending, and demands for improved separation technologies, there is a growing interest in developing alternative and more cost effective methods of separation. To meet this goal it is necessary for both engineers and scientists to work together and to have a basic understanding of how the technology of one affects the science of the other (and vice-versa). This paper considers some of the implications of the work of colloid scientists for the separations technologist, with particular reference to sedimentation and filtration processes...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{internal}} combustion engine with distinct advantages over conventional piston-engines and gas turbines in small power ranges is presented. The engine has analogies with piston engine operation, but like gas turbines it has dedicated spaces and devices for compression, burning and expansion. The engine operates on a modified limited-pressure thermodynamic cycle. The core of the engine is a nutating non-rotating disk, with the center of its hub mounted {{in the middle of}} a Z-shaped shaft. The two ends of the shaft rotate, while the disk nutates. The motion of the disk circumference prescribes a portion of a sphere. In the single-disk configuration a portion of the surface area of the disk is used for intake and compression, a portion is used to seal against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for expansion and exhaust. The compressed air is admitted to an external accumulator, and then into an external combustion chamber before it is admitted to the power side of the disk. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to operate on a variable compression ratio cycle. Variations in cycle temperature ratio and compression ratio during normal <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the engine to effectively become a variable-cycle engine, allowing significant flexibility for optimizing efficiency or power output. The thermal efficiency is similar to that of medium sized diesel engines. For the same engine volume and weight this engine produces approximately twice the power of a two-stroke engine and four times the power of a four-stroke engine. The computed sea-level engine performance at design and off-design conditions in the 2 to 500 Â kW power range is presented.

40|$|International audienceHyperboloid is a {{multi-directional}} {{mass spectrometer}} measuring ion distribution {{functions in the}} auroral and polar magnetosphere of the Earth in the thermal and suprathermal energy range. The instrument encompasses two analyzers containing a total of 26 entrance windows, and viewing in two almost mutually perpendicular half-planes. The nominal angular resolution {{is defined by the}} field of view of individual windows ˜ 13 ° × 12. 5 °. Energy analysis is performed using spherical electrostatic analyzers providing differential measurements between 1 and 80 eV. An ion beam emitter (RON experiment) and/or a potential bias applied to Hyperboloid entrance surface are used to counteract adverse effects of spacecraft potential and thus enable ion measurements down to very low energies. A magnetic analyzer focuses ions on one of four micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors, depending on their mass/charge ratio. Normal modes of <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> to measure H +, He +, O ++, and O + simultaneously. An automatic MCP gain control software is used to adapt the instrument to the great flux dynamics encountered between spacecraft perigee (700 km) and apogee (20 000 km). Distribution functions in the main analyzer half-plane are obtained after a complete scan of windows and energies with temporal resolution between one and a few seconds. Three-dimensional (3 D) distributions are measured in one spacecraft spin period (120 s). The secondary analyzer has a much smaller geometrical factor, but offers partial access to the 3 D dependence of the distributions with a few seconds temporal resolution. Preliminary results are presented. Simultaneous, local heating of both H + and O + ions resulting in conical distributions below 80 eV is observed up to 3 Earth's radii altitudes. The thermal ion signatures associated with large-scale nightside magnetospheric boundaries are investigated and a new ion outflow feature is identified associated to the polar edge of the auroral oval.

40|$|This thesis investigates how peace {{operations}} work. It {{contributes to}} the larger study of peace operation effectiveness by analysing the processes through which these institutions influence local actors in postconflict societies. Looking beyond traditional concerns with mandates and resources, it aims to understand how a peace operation seeks to achieve its goals, focusing on why local populations might cooperate with or obstruct its activities. The thesis draws on theories of social power, compliance and legitimation to answer four central questions: what power do peace operations have to achieve their objectives? From where do peace operations derive power? How do local perceptions of an <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> or constrain its effectiveness? How are peace operations legitimised at the local level, and with what effect? It begins by critically reviewing the academic literature, arguing that existing approaches are unable to account for important dimensions of peace operation effectiveness because they neglect the local setting in which operations pursue their goals, {{and the extent to}} which the achievement of those goals requires local cooperation. It then develops an analytical framework to examine the processes of coercion, inducement and legitimacy through which peace operations seek to shape the decisions and actions of local actors. This power-legitimacy framework is applied to study the effectiveness of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and the Regional Assistance Mission in Solomon Islands (RAMSI). By comparing variation in local cooperation between and within these cases, the thesis shows that the way a peace operation is locally perceived is an important but often overlooked determinant of its effectiveness. In particular, when local actors perceive a peace operation to be legitimate, they are more likely to behave in ways that assist the operation to achieve its goals. The thesis concludes by discussing the implications of this finding for the future study and practice of peace operations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in the development of}} artificial skin concepts {{is a result of the}} increased demand for providing environment perception such as touch and flow sensing to robots, prosthetics and surgical tools. Tactile sensors are the essential components of artificial skins and attracted considerable attention that led to the development of different technologies for mimicking the complex sense of touch in humans. This dissertation work is devoted to the development of a bioinspired tactile sensing technology that imitates the extremely sensitive hair-like cilia receptors found in nature. The artificial cilia are fabricated from permanent magnetic, biocompatible and highly elastic nanocomposite material, and integrated on a giant magneto-impedance magnetic sensor to measure the stray field. A force that bends the cilia changes the stray field and is therefore detected with the magnetic sensor, providing high performance in terms of sensitivity, power consumption and versatility. The nanocomposite is made of Fe nanowires (NWs) incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Fe NWs have a high remanent magnetization, due the shape anisotropy; thus, they are acting as permanent nano-magnets. This allows remote device operation and avoids the need for a magnetic field to magnetize the NWs, benefiting miniaturization and the possible range of applications. The magnetic properties of the nanocomposite can be easily tuned by modifying the NWs concentration or by aligning the NWs to define a magnetic anisotropy. Tactile sensors are realized on flexible and rigid substrates that can detect flow, vertical and shear forces statically and dynamically, with a high resolution and wide operating range. The advantage to operate the sensors in liquids and air has been utilized to measure flows in different fluids in a microfluidic channel. Various dynamic studies were conducted with the tactile sensor demonstrating the detection of moving objects or the texture of objects. Overall, the results confirm the possibility to easily control the sensors’ performance with the cilia arrangement and dimensions. The cost effective mold-based microfabrication process and magnetic <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> a high degree of integration, which together with the extremely low power consumption make the artificial cilia sensor reported in this dissertation an attractive solution for many applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{safety of}} nuclear power plants (NPPs) {{is based on the}} defence in depth concept, which relies on {{successive}} physical barriers (fuel matrix, cladding, primary system pressure boundary and containment) and other provisions to control radioactive materials and on multiple levels of protection against damage to these barriers. Deterministic safety analysis is an important tool for conforming the adequacy and efficiency of provisions within the defence in depth concept and is used to predict the response of an NPP in predetermined operational states. This type of safety analysis applies a specific set of rules and specific acceptance criteria. Deterministic analysis is typically focused on neutronic, thermohydraulic, radiological and structural aspects, which are often analysed with different computational tools. The advanced computational tools developed for deterministic safety analysis are used for better establishment and utilization of licensing margins or safety margins in consideration of analysis results. At the same time, the existence of such margins ensures that NPPs operate safely in all modes of operation and at all times. To properly assess and address the existing margins {{and to be able to}} take advantage of unnecessary conservatisms, state of the art analytical tools intended for safety assessment have been developed. Progress made in the development and application of modern codes for safety analysis and better understanding of phenomena involved in plant design and <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the analysts to determine safety margins in consideration of analysis results (licensing margins) with higher precision. There is a general tendency for utilities to take advantage of unnecessarily large conservatisms in safety analyses and to utilize them for reactor power uprates, better utilization of nuclear fuel, higher operational flexibility and for justification of lifetime extension. The present publication sets forth the results of a Technical Meeting on the Implications of Power Uprates for the Safety Margins of Nuclear Power Plants, which was organized in cooperation with the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and was held in Vienna, 13 – 15 October 2003. At this meeting, specific topics relating to the utilization of safety margins for NPP power uprates were presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutating}} {{engine is}} {{a new type of}} internal combustion engine with distinct advantages over conventional piston engines and gas turbines in small power ranges. The engine's unique arrangement flexibility allows several alternative disk and shaft configurations, each selected for a different application. Variations in cycle temperature ratio and compression ratio during normal <b>operation</b> <b>enable</b> the engine to effectively become a variable-cycle engine, allowing significant flexibility for maximum efficiency or power or other optimizing function for on-ground stationary or for airborne applications. In its basic configuration the core of the engine is a nutating nonrotating disk, with the center of its hub mounted {{in the middle of a}} Z-shaped shaft. The two ends of the shaft rotate, while the disk "nutates," performs a wobbling motion without rotating around its axis. The motion of the disk circumference prescribes a portion of a sphere. A portion of the area of the disk is used for intake and compression, a portion is used to seal against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for expansion and exhaust. The compressed air is admitted to an external accumulator and then into an external combustion chamber before it is admitted to the power side of the disk. A companion paper examines the performance potential of the one-disk engine. This paper examines alternative engine configurations. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to operate on a variable compression ratio cycle. In addition, separate disks of unequal size are used for intake and expansion, resulting in distinct and significant power efficiency, fuel flexibility, and arrangement advantages over conventional piston engines, over gas turbines, and over the basic nutating-engine configuration. The performance of these arrangements is examined for: on-ground power, on-ground efficiency, (auxiliary power, automotive); and for small and light airframe applications for flight Mach numbers from 0 to 1 and altitudes from 0 to 20 km.

40|$|Relatório de estágio de mestrado em Ensino de Matemática no 3. º Ciclo do Ensino Básico e no Ensino SecundárioO presente relatório teve como {{principal}} propósito compreender como é que os alunos se apropriam dos conceitos da Geometria do nono ano de escolaridade quando utilizam materiais manipuláveis e como os utilizam na consolidação desses conceitos. Neste sentido, para ajudar a delinear a estrutura deste estudo, formularam-se três questões orientadoras: 1) Como utilizam os alunos do 9. º ano os materiais manipuláveis na aprendizagem de Geometria?; 2) Que dificuldades revelam os alunos na utilização dos materiais manipuláveis na aprendizagem de Geometria? e 3) Qual a relação entre as perceções dos alunos sobre a influência dos materiais manipuláveis e a sua aprendizagem em Geometria? Enquanto professora, a preocupação centra-se em proporcionar atividades em que os alunos sejam parte ativa no processo de ensino e aprendizagem da matemática, o que requer uma renovação no modo de organizar e ensinar na aula de matemática. Os materiais manipuláveis aliados a tarefas desafiantes e motivadoras promovem o envolvimento ativo dos alunos nas atividades em sala de aula e permitem a concretização de conceitos. Tendo em vista os objetivos do estudo, analisou-se o trabalho de uma turma do nono ano de escolaridade, constituída por dezoito alunos, pertencentes ao concelho de Barcelos, em torno de seis tarefas que pressupunham a utilização de diferentes materiais manipuláveis. O estudo aponta que o sucesso do uso dos materiais manipuláveis em sala de aula, efetivamente, depende do modo como é introduzido em sala de aula, do à vontade do professor com o material, do tipo de {{material e}} do tipo de atividade realizada por parte dos alunos que lhe está inerente e da predisposição dos alunos para trabalharem com os materiais. Assim sendo, quando estas condições são favoráveis, os materiais manipuláveis são bons facilitadores para representar e descrever ideias matemáticas. Assim, a sua manipulação e exploração propiciam um ambiente de experiência Matemática, onde os alunos podem testar e provar as suas conjeturas, bem como comunicar as suas ideias, levando-os a apropriarem-se de um conjunto de características geométricas do objeto que lhes dá maior flexibilidade de raciocínio. The {{main purpose of}} this report was to understand how students interpret the concepts of ninth grade geometry when they use manipulable materials and how they use them in the consolidation of these concepts. In this sense, to help delineate the structure of this study, three guiding questions were formulated: 1) How are manipulable materials by students in the ninth grade to learn Geometry?; 2) What difficulties do students reveal {{in the use of}} manipulable materials in learning Geometry? and 3) What is the relationship between students' perceptions about the influence of manipulable materials and their learning in Geometry? As teachers, the concern is on providing activities in which students are active in the process of teaching and learning of mathematics, which requires a renewal in organization and teaching in the math class. Manipulable materials combined with motivating and challenging tasks promote the active involvement of students in classroom activities and enable the consolidation of concepts. In light of the objectives of the study, I analysed the work of a ninth grade class, consisting of eighteen students belonging to the municipality of Barcelos, around six tasks that presupposed using different manipulable materials. The study points out that the success of the use of manipulable materials in the classroom effectively depends on how it is introduced in the classroom, on the teacher's ease with the material, the type of material and the type of activity performed by the students and the students' predisposition to work with materials. However, when these conditions are favourable, the manipulable materials are good facilitators to represent and describe mathematical ideas.
