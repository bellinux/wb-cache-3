40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the Superpave specified <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> on Marshall mix design parameters. Twenty eight (28) asphalt concrete mixtures were prepared in three types of gradations such that the gradations were above, through and below the Superpave restricted zone.

Statistical analysis showed that all three types of mixtures, above, through and below the restricted zone, did not have any significant difference on Marshall stability and void in mineral aggregate (VMA). The mixtures with gradation passing below the restricted zone showed higher air voids (Va) and lower flow values than gradation passing above and through the restricted zone.

The present study was taken up with the objectives of evaluating the effect of <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> on indirect tensile strength, shear strength and rutting behaviour of bituminous mixes and thereby to establish the relationship between some <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> parameters and tensile strength, shear strength, horizontal tensile strain and rutting values. Three <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradations,</b> two types of binder; VG- 30 and PMB- 40 and two types of mixes, Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) are used.

In general, the BC mix is better than DBM mix in term of indirect tensile strength (ITS), horizontal tensile strain (HTS), and the compressive strength, while DBM mix is better in terms of shear strength and rut resistance.

The most severe form of laboratory compaction in terms of potential aggregate degradation, i. e.

The results of aggregate degradation have been determined by comparing the <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> in terms of retained aggregate per individual sieve size before and after compaction. The <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> after compaction has been determined by recovering the aggregate from compacted asphalt mixture specimens and then re-grading using the series of sieve sizes used to batch the original material.

The gap-graded asphalt mixture experienced a greater amount of aggregate degradation after compaction compared to the continuously graded mixture.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{goals of}} this study included investigation of the optimal ranges for paste content, amount of cementations materials and <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> for concrete paving mixtures. In general, the optimum concrete mixtures developed in this study contained low paste content (below 23 %), and were characterized by low scaling and sorptivity. In addition, it was also possible to achieve high cement replacement levels for these mixtures. Finally, for optimized fly ash mixtures, the selection of well graded <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> with high packing density increased the most desired paste content for those mixtures, thus indicating that combined <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> has strong influence on concrete performance. Lastly, concrete mixtures developed with optimum ranges of variables studied in this research contained low cement content. The overall scope of the research was divided into three distinctive phases, {{each of which is}} described briefly below: PHASE I: This phase consisted of statistical optimization of the proportions of concrete binder. The Central Composite Design methodology (CCD) was used to design the experiment for the optimization of binder in three types of concrete mixtures: a) cement + fly ash, b) cement + GGBFS, and c) cement + fly ash + GGBFS. The variables studied in each of these systems included: paste content (from 21 to 25 % by mixture volume) and total content of supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in the mixture. This was expressed as weight percent of total binder, and varied depending on the binder system used. PHASE II: The main goal of this phase was to investigate the effect of different <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradations</b> on the fresh and hardened properties of optimized concrete mixtures developed in PHASE I, as well as to identify the most desired <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradations</b> for paving mixtures. Different <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradations</b> were prepared by blending of 2, 3 or 4 different sizes of aggregates based on concept of Shilstone’s Coarseness Factor Chart. PHASE III: The concept of air-free paste–aggregate void saturation ratio (k”) introduced in PHASE II seemed to fairly accurate link the properties of concrete mixtures with their paste content. Thus, it was decided to further investigate this concept in connection with aggregate packing density (Φ).

After that, only colemanite aggregate was used with same <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation.</b> Then, the next step of the study, Marshall samples were produced by changing coarse and fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>gradation</b> as limestone and colemanite and Marshall test were conducted. When evaluated the results samples which produced with only limestone aggregate gave the maximum Marshall Stability value. When handled other mixture groups (Only colemanite, colemanite as coarse aggregate-limestone as fine aggregate, colemanite as fine aggregate-limestone as coarse aggregate) all groups were verified specification limits. As a result, especially in areas where there is widespread colemanite waste, if transportation costs did not exceed the cost of limestone, colemanite stone waste could be used instead of limestone in asphalt concrete mixtures as fine aggregat...|$|R
