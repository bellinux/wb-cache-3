Winning the top prize was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have reclaimed the record from Rutter; however, Jennings finished with only $100,000, leaving him in second place. Jennings later {{appeared on}} the ABC prime time show 500 Questions in 2016; however, as he only lasted four questions, {{he was unable to}} add to his total.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grummit made a retort the feebleness {{of which}} was {{somewhat}} balanced by its ferocity, and subsided into glum silence.

25|$|Owen's {{last two}} years of formal {{education}} saw him as a pupil-teacher at the Wyle Cop school in Shrewsbury. In 1911 he passed the matriculation exam for the University of London, but not with the first-class honours needed for a scholarship, which in his family's circumstances was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have afforded to attend.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get his ugly, no-talent face {{on television and in}} the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

50|$|When Verginius arrived {{two days}} later he {{gathered}} his supporters in the Forum. Claudius, however, would not let him speak, and declared that Verginia was indeed Marcus Claudius' slave. Appius Claudius had brought an armed escort with him and accused the citizens of sedition. The supporters of Verginius left the Forum rather than cause any violence, and Verginius begged to question his daughter himself. Claudius agreed to this, but Verginius grabbed a knife and, at the Shrine of Venus Cloacina, he stabbed Verginia, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> uphold her freedom. Verginius and Icilius were arrested, and their supporters returned to attack the lictors and destroy their fasces. This led to {{the overthrow of the}} decemviri and the re-establishment of the Roman Republic.|$|R
25|$|Richards {{maintained}} cordial relations {{after breaking}} up with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d. June 13, 2017), {{the mother of his}} first three children. Richards and Pallenberg, who never married, were a couple from 1967 to 1979. Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972. Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne (after Richards' and Pallenberg's friend Guinness heir Tara Browne), died on 6 June 1976 at just over two months old of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since. He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said it was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> cope.|$|E
500|$|A {{key issue}} was whether Bamber {{received}} a call from his father that night to say Sheila had [...] "gone berserk" [...] with a gun. Bamber said that he did, that he alerted police, and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that the father had made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it—indeed, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have known about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E
500|$|While free on bail, Vicious smashed a {{beer mug}} {{in the face}} of Todd Smith, Patti Smith's brother, and was arrested again on an assault charge. On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and {{underwent}} enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose, aged 21. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, [...] "Poor Sid. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> live up to what he wanted everyone to believe about him was to die. That was tragic, but more for Sid than anyone else. He really bought his public image." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later, {{when her}} {{roommates}} come to pay bail, Alec apologizes, {{saying that he}} didn't know her last name {{and that this was}} the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see her again. He says that it might be something {{that the two of them}} would laugh about years later, but Megan is still angry because she had to spend time in jail. She makes him a deal, asking for his number and promising to call him the moment she laughed about it. She takes a closer look at the presents he gave her. Minutes later, she starts laughing upon seeing the balloon read [...] "I'm sorry, I'm an asshole" [...] and calls Alec. He meets her outside the police station and they kiss in the middle of the road, when it starts snowing again.|$|R
60|$|To {{repeat this}} word to himself thus was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> focus or make it thinkable.

500|$|Nevertheless, by {{the time}} of his appointment, Rimsky-Korsakov had become painfully aware of his {{technical}} shortcomings as a composer; he later wrote, [...] "I was a dilettante and knew nothing". Moreover, he had come to a creative dead-end upon completing his opera The Maid of Pskov and realized that developing a solid musical technique was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue composing. He turned to Tchaikovsky for advice and guidance. When Rimsky-Korsakov underwent a change in attitude on music education and began his own intensive studies privately, his fellow nationalists accused him of throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally. He told Rimsky-Korsakov that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.|$|E
500|$|Saprang was {{considered}} a strong contender to lead the junta given the mandatory retirement of Army commander-in-chief and CNS President Sonthi Boonyaratkalin in September 2007. [...] He unofficially competed with fellow Assistant Army Commander Anupong Paochinda, who, as 1st Army Area Commander, secured Bangkok {{on the night of}} the coup. [...] The Bangkok Post reported in October 2006 that Sonthi was grooming Anupong to be his successor by giving him responsibilities over coup logistics, a greater task than had been assigned to Saprang. [...] The Asia Times quoted a former MP as saying that [...] "Anupong is seen as the real force behind the coup. Saprang is more vocal, but he has no real base. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be seen as a promising leader is by pushing the country to the brink." ...|$|E
500|$|The Austrian {{failure to}} follow up with Frederick meant that the Prussians lived to fight another day. [...] Daun took great {{criticism}} for this, but not {{from the people who}} mattered the most, the Empress and her minister Kaunitz. For Frederick, instead of having the war decided at Hochkirch, he had the opportunity over the winter to rebuild his army. In two years of fighting (1756–1757) Frederick had lost over 100,000 soldiers to death, wounds, capture, disease and desertion. By Hochkirch, many regiments were only half-disciplined. In the winter after Hochkirch, he could only replace his soldiers with untrained men, many of whom would be foreigners and prisoners-of-war; he would be starting 1759 with a half-trained army of recruits, and seasoned soldiers who were exhausted by the slaughter. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hire men would be with British gold.|$|E
5000|$|Rank {{was born}} on 22 or 23 December 1888 at Kingston upon Hull in England into a Victorian family environment, which was {{dominated}} by his father Joseph Rank who had built a substantial flour milling business. He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Joseph {{is reported to have}} told his son Arthur that he was [...] "a dunce at school" [...] and that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> succeed in life would be in his father's flour mill. J. Arthur ventured on his own with Peterkins Self-Raising Flour, but when that business failed he returned to work for his father. That was the business (Joseph Rank Limited) that he later inherited and which became known as Rank Hovis McDougall (now owned by British food conglomerate Premier Foods).|$|R
60|$|Chris {{burst into}} his ringing laugh, and danced a wild sort of jig round his mate, as the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> fitly express his relief; {{for he had}} been so bowed down with remorse at his {{imprudence}} in letting Corny go that no one could find the heart to blame him, and all night the poor lad had rushed up and down seeking, calling, hoping, and fearing, till he was about used up, and looked nearly as dilapidated as Corny.|$|R

500|$|As the Autobots flee, the {{tensions}} {{within the group}} boil over, and Ironhide beats Mirage, whom he believes is the traitor, near to death. He is wrong, as Sunstreaker's guilt finally overtakes him and he confesses everything to Ironhide, before sacrificing himself to halt the Swarm's pursuit by destroying a vital bridge. On Earth Starscream again plans a coup, {{with help from the}} Insecticons, who have experimented on the real reason the Decepticons were able to access the Autobot codes and systems - a captured, dissected but still living Hunter. Spike links up with the remnants of the human resistance, aiming to kill Megatron with a prototype weapon made from Shockwave's gun arm, killing Rumble in the process. His efforts are for naught, as the other world nations still aim to bomb New York. On Cybertron, Prime is revived, managing to quell the dissent amongst the other Autobots. They are almost overwhelmed by the Swarm, but are saved by the timely arrival of Omega Supreme, who transforms and takes the Autobots to Earth. On Earth Starscream begins a coup against Megatron, gathering the Insecticons and Constructicons to his side. Megatron battles back and avoids being killed by Devastator as the United Nations begin a determined aerial counterstrike. As Starscream realizes that Megatron has orchestrated his coup to weed out the weak in the Decepticons, the Autobots arrive and attack. In the midst of the battle, Megatron reveals his strategy. More of his troops are hidden, disguised, among the humans, including the carrier for the UN nuclear bomb. With this, Megatron intends to wipe out the humans. However, with the intervention of a disgruntled Thundercracker the European Union is prevented from nuking New York City, though he pays for his [...] "betrayal". Megatron is severely damaged by the combined efforts of Optimus Prime and Spike, but is saved by Starscream who determines that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> become the leader of the Decepticons is by taking the leadership from Megatron and not for it to be offered to him. The Decepticons retreat from Earth leaving the Autobots amongst humans hostile toward any Cybertronians. Sideswipe discovers the captive Hunter, who had been tortured by Bombshell's experiments, and euthanizes him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Heenan {{applied for the}} Army Supplementary Reserve, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> become an officer without formal qualifications. According to Elphick, had Heenan's illegitimacy been known, it would have {{prevented}} him becoming an officer. He was able to join the reserve by presenting his baptism certificate, along with a certificate signed by his school headmaster, stating that Heenan was capable of performing the duties of an officer. This was endorsed by the commander of Cheltenham's OTC.|$|E
2500|$|Blakeslee had studiously avoided {{being part}} of the American {{volunteer}} Eagle Squadrons, claiming [...] "they played sister in making their claims." [...] But when told he would be assigned to be an instructor pilot, he finally volunteered to be sent to No. 133 (Eagle) Squadron RAF as its commanding officer, which was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> remain on combat status. During the raid against Dieppe, France on August 18, 1942, Blakeslee shot down a further FW-190, and another probably destroyed on the 19th, thus achieving ace status.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{return to}} the town where Marsh intends to buy drinks for the posse he is called into the office of Judge Baker and Marshal Collins who show him {{the body of the}} real Paige who was buried in a shallow grave dug up by coyotes. As he is dressed as an Easterner and not dressed for riding the <b>only</b> {{possible}} <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have come to the area would be as a passenger on the stage that Marsh came in on. Marsh denies he had a travelling companion; as the Marshal and Judge examine the body they find a label in the dead man's jacket with the name of Zachary Paige. As Marsh draws his pistol the pair are shot in the back from an open window by Gimpy armed with a rifle. When the townspeople burst in and see Marsh's weapon unfired they believe Ruth Lawrence is responsible.|$|R
5000|$|Wade was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most memorable umpiring decisions in VFL history. In the 1962 Preliminary Final Replay, Geelong was trailing Carlton by five points with seconds remaining. The ball came down to Wade and Carlton full-back Peter Barry, and Wade out-manoeuvered Barry to mark 25 metres out in front; but umpire Irving penalised Wade, who was in front, for holding on to Barry's shorts in the contest. Wade said: [...] "All I did was to keep my eyes on the ball and maneuvered for position. The <b>only</b> possible <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have penalised me was for sticking out my posterior as I went to mark." [...] Percy Beames wrote in The Age: [...] "Wade was extremely unlucky. Nine times out of ten these incidents are overlooked." [...] Former umpire Allen Nash said at the time:" [...] It was the most courageous decision I've ever seen by an umpire." ...|$|R
50|$|Women are {{supposed}} to avoid intercourse while menstruating. It is believed that sexually transmitted diseases are the results of women deceiving men and having intercourse while they are menstruating. Gonorrhea translates as “disease you get from women” in Sumba; {{it has become a}} social problem. When a man would get this disease, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> they believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> rid himself of painful sores was to pass it to a woman. The reasoning was that a woman’s body can absorb infection and purge it during a cycle.|$|R

The Cubs staggered {{to the end}} of the season in 2002, and Hendry purged several veterans from the roster. One veteran, Todd Hundley, a free agent acquisition before the 2001 season, struggled on the field, feuded with fans, and had even begun to tarnish the image of his father Randy Hundley, a member of the Cubs teams of the 1960s and 1970s. Hundley's large contract would have made trading him difficult, so the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> leave the team would be if Hendry released him. Nevertheless, former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Dan Evans, offered second baseman Mark Grudzielanek and first baseman Eric Karros. Grudzielanek and Karros were also high-priced veterans with their careers waning. But the two players managed productive seasons in 2003, also providing veteran leadership.|$|R
