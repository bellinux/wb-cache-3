5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number <b>of</b> <b>agents,</b> or queued for a small number <b>of</b> <b>agents.</b> When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E

Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942.
