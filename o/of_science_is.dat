5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> <b>is</b> the {{measurement}} of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> a {{sub-field}} {{of philosophy}} {{concerned with the}} foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.|$|E
50|$|The Halls <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> <b>were</b> {{mainly for}} adult {{education}} and self-help, like those offered by Mechanics' Institutes and religious organisations at the time. The South Kensington Hall <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> <b>was</b> started by Edward Aveling, and other teachers included her sister Alice Bradlaugh (1856-1888) and Annie Besant. The {{results from the}} South Kensington Hall <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> <b>were</b> very good, with students exceeding the national average on their examinations {{in all but one}} of their offered classes.|$|R

5|$|Pinker also {{speaks about}} {{evolutionary}} psychology in the podcast {{and believes that}} this area <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> going to pay off. He cites {{the fact that there}} are many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to evolutionary psychology that these areas are being studied.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is,</b> there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of the History <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> <b>is</b> housed on Broad St in the world's oldest-surviving {{purpose-built}} museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing {{almost all}} aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a collection of over 200 old master paintings.|$|E
50|$|The Institute of the History <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} on the decree of the Presidium of ANAS on February 27, 2014 and Meryem Seyidbeyli, the Doctor <b>of</b> Historical <b>Sciences,</b> <b>was</b> appointed {{the director of}} the Institute <b>of</b> the <b>Science</b> <b>of</b> History of ANAS.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the aims}} <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> to find models that {{will account for}} as many {{observations}} as possible within a coherent framework.

25|$|Searle {{has argued}} that critics like Daniel Dennett, who (he claims) insist that {{discussing}} subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a category error. Perhaps the goal <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> to establish and validate statements which are epistemically objective, (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party), but are not necessarily ontologically objective.|$|E

25|$|Ludwik Fleck {{establishes}} scientific constructivism {{by introducing}} {{the notions of}} thought collective (Denkkollektiv), and thought style (Denkstil), through which the evolution <b>of</b> <b>science</b> <b>is</b> much more understandable, because the research objects {{can be described in}} terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by Thomas Kuhn.|$|E
