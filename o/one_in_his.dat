5|$|He {{ended the}} 2006–07 Ashes with {{a century and}} two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 whitewash. It was an {{inconsistent}} series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> other three innings. Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century.|$|E
5|$|These centuries led to {{his debut}} for Australia in the Fifth Test at Sydney on 28 February 1947. Hamence scored 30notout in the first innings as Australia made 253 in {{response}} to England's first innings 280. England managed 186 in response and Australia, set 213 to win, reached it in 52.2overs. However Hamence made only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second innings.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} after the Test series came against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England eleven; for this tour, Bradman insisted {{that no more}} than six current Test players be allowed to represent for the hosts. The Australian skipper then fielded a full-strength team. Miller returned for this match, held at Scarborough, but did little, scoring <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> only innings and bowling eight overs without success in a match that ended in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{signed for}} League Two Bradford City on 29 June 2012 on a two-year contract.

Meredith scored his first goal for Bradford in a 3–1 home win against Cheltenham Town on 20 October 2012. He achieved promotion into League <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{first season with}} Bradford, playing in their 3–0 victory over Northampton Town in the 2013 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 18 May 2013.

5|$|On January 8, 1977, McLaughlin {{signed with}} the Seattle Mariners. On April 1, 1977, the Mariners loaned him to the Nuevo Laredo Mexican League franchise.

In the Mexican League that season, McLaughlin compiled a record of 18–13 with a 1.84 ERA and 221 strikeouts as his team, the Tecolotes, won the league championship. On September 11, 1977, he was returned to the Mariners. McLaughlin made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on September 18, against the Kansas City Royals at Kaufman Stadium.

5|$|Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' {{is a white}} {{form from}} Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but none had been {{previously}} preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which grew on water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the Macadamia twig girdler.|$|E

5|$|Toshack {{started the}} 1946–47 season strongly, taking 5/46 and 4/70 as New South Wales {{opened the season}} with a five-wicket win over Queensland. He removed Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon twice. After going wicketless in a rain-curtailed match for his state against England, Toshack was {{selected}} to make his Ashes debut in the First Test at Brisbane. With the emergence of leading all rounder Keith Miller, Toshack was relegated to first change bowler as Miller began his much celebrated partnership with Lindwall. Toshack was unbeaten on <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first innings with the bat when Australia were bowled out for 645 on the third day.|$|E
5|$|Born in Albury, Meredith {{started his}} career with the Derby County youth system in 2004, signing a {{professional}} contract in 2006. He was loaned out to Cambridge United and Chesterfield before moving to Sligo Rovers. He returned to England with Shrewsbury Town, but after making only three appearances for them, he joined A.F.C. Telford United on loan for most of the 2008–09 season. He played for them in the semi-finals of both the Conference League Cup and the FA Trophy, as well as the 2009 Conference North play-off Final. Meredith joined York City in 2009 {{and at the end of}} his first season played for them in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. Two years later he won in the 2012 FA Trophy Final and 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final with York at Wembley, the latter seeing the club promoted to League Two. He signed for Bradford City in 2012, winning promotion to League <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first season with victory in the 2013 League Two play-off Final. In 2017, Meredith moved to Millwall in the Championship.|$|E

5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E
5|$|Former England captain Bryan Robson {{took over}} as new manager during the {{following}} season, but, under his management, City won only seven games from 28 and were relegated in 23rd place. Robson left {{and was replaced by}} his assistant Colin Todd. The club went into administration for a second time, but Todd led them to 11th in each of the following two seasons. Following fan pressure and a poor run of results, Rhodes sacked Todd on 12 February 2007, with City just three points above the relegation zone. Wetherall was appointed player-manager on a temporary basis and then {{for the rest of the}} season, but City were relegated following a 3–0 defeat to Chesterfield. During the summer of 2007, former midfielder Stuart McCall returned as manager with City in the bottom tier for the first time in 25years. He set himself a target of earning promotion back to League <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first season, but twice missed out on promotion before he left the club in February 2010 with City lying 16th in League Two.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take over in the summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first season.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Waddock's {{contract}} was terminated after {{a change of}} ownership and he was replaced by Michael Appleton. Waddock's surprise sacking ensured he had the worst record of any Oxford manager, winning only once and losing seven times in his eight games {{in charge of the}} club. After an indifferent first season under Appleton, Oxford achieved promotion to League <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second year in charge, finishing the 2015–16 season in 2nd place with 86 points. They also reached the final of the League Trophy at Wembley Stadium, only the club's third appearance at the national stadium, but were defeated 3–2 by their League One opponents Barnsley. In 2016–17, having sold Kemar Roofe during the close season for a record £3m and signed Marvin Johnson for an undisclosed fee also thought to be a club record, Oxford finished 8th in League One, four points short of the playoff places, and again lost in the final of the League Trophy at Wembley, this time to relegation-bound Coventry City. Appleton left the club to become assistant manager at Leicester City of the Premier League in June 2017, and was replaced by Pep Clotet, formerly assistant manager at Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|Loxton then {{played in}} each of Australia’s four {{remaining}} tour games before the Tests, {{but was unable to}} do enough to force his way into the first-choice team. He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire, and 16 against Nottinghamshire, squandering his starts in the latter two innings to run outs. In the match against Hampshire, he made <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket. The Australian team's batting depth did not help Loxton’s cause; in the final pre-Test match against Sussex, a match won by an innings and 325 runs, he was slated to bat at No. 9, but Australia’s earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5/549. The all-rounder’s 3/13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line-up {{for the rest of the}} match, as Doug Ring, Ernie Toshack, Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory. Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn, and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance, so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Bradman again opted to use Brown out of position in the middle-order as Australia took an eight-wicket win.|$|E
5|$|On November 14 VanVleet tallied 7 steals in {{the opener}} against New Mexico State, which tied a school record. On December 3, against #25 Utah VanVleet, helped Wichita State recover from a 9-point deficit in the final 2:45 of {{regulation}} with 8 points (including two three-point shots in the final 1:15) and an assist on a three-point shot, but with 7 seconds remaining in overtime and Wichita trailing by one, he missed {{the front end of}} a one and <b>one.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> return visit to Chicago and the Gentile Center to play Loyola on January 11, he again was perfect from the field with a 5-for-5 performance and added a career-high tying 10 assists (as well as 6 rebounds and 3 steals) for his first career double-double. VanVleet, however, snapped his perfect streak of 20 free throws made in his home state with a 3-for-4 performance. In the rematch against Loyola on January 28, VanVleet posted a career-high 27 points. On February 7, VanVleet posted the first triple double for Wichita State Shockers men's basketball in 43 years with a 10-point 10-rebound 11-assist 4-steal performance against Missouri State. On February 16, VanVleet was Missouri Valley Conference Co-Player of the Week (with Seth Tuttle). On February 26, VanVleet broke the all-time Wichita State career assist record against Evansville with 431 assists, surpassing Warren Armstrong who had 429 and Toure Murry who had 430. VanVleet was one of 17 finalists for the Cousy Award. The Shockers defeated Northern Iowa on February 28 to win the Missouri Valley Conference regular season title. In the opening game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament for the Shockers, VanVleet matched a career high with 27 points against Indiana. He finished the tournament with 17-point and 25-point performances against #2-seeded Kansas and #3-seeded Notre Dame, respectively.|$|E
