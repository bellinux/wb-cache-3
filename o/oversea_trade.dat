The [...] "Great Elector" [...] had spent part of his childhood at the Pomeranian court and port cities of Wolgast (1631–1633) and Stettin (1633–1635), and afterwards studied at the Dutch universities of Leyden and The Hague (1635–1638). When Frederick William became elector in 1640, he invited Dutch engineers to Brandenburg, sent Brandenburgian engineers to study in the Netherlands, and in 1646 married educated Luise Henriette of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau. After the Thirty Years' War, Frederick William tried to acquire finances to rebuild the country by participating in <b>oversea</b> <b>trade,</b> and attempted to found a Brandenburg-Prussian East Indies Company. He engaged former Dutch admiral Aernoult Gijsels van Lier as advisor and tried to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor and princes of the empire to participate. The emperor, however, declined the request as he considered it dangerous to disturb the interest of the other European powers. In 1651, Frederick William bought Danish Fort Dansborg and Tranquebar for 120,000 reichstalers. As Frederick William was unable to raise this sum, he asked several people and Hanseatic towns to invest in the project, but since none of these were able or willing to give sufficient money, the treaty with Denmark was nullified in 1653.|$|E
60|$|Any {{trickle of}} <b>oversea</b> <b>trade</b> that passes yet that way must be {{creeping}} along cautiously with the unlighted, war-blighted black coast close on one hand, and sudden {{death on the}} other. For all the space we steamed through that Sunday evening must now be one great minefield, sown thickly with the seeds of hate; while submarines steal out to sea, over the very spot perhaps where the insect-dinghy put a pilot on board of us with so much fussy importance. Mines; Submarines. The last word in sea-warfare! Progress--impressively disclosed by this war.|$|E
50|$|In Song Dynasty, {{especially}} during the Southern Song Dynasty, China's economy volume reached new height, and its <b>oversea</b> <b>trading</b> was booming. The traditional copper or iron coins could not satisfy the demand of money circulation. Under this background, the paper money/banknote so called Jiaozi (交子) was first appeared in China.|$|R
5|$|Piel Castle, {{also known}} as Fouldry Castle or the Pile of Fouldray, is a castle {{situated}} on the south-eastern point of Piel Island, {{off the coast of}} the Furness Peninsula in north-west England. Built in the early-14th century by John Cockerham, the Abbot of neighbouring Furness Abbey, it was intended to <b>oversea</b> the <b>trade</b> through the local harbour and to protect against Scottish raids. The castle was built using stones from the local beach, and featured a large keep with surrounding inner and outer baileys. It was used as a base by the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487, but by 1534 it had fallen into ruin and passed {{into the hands of the}} Crown. Sea erosion began to cause significant damage to the castle in the early 19th century. In the 1870s the castle's owner, the Duke of Buccleuch, carried out extensive restoration work and erected outworks to protect it against further damage from the sea. In 1920 the castle was given to the town of Barrow-in-Furness and is now in the care of English Heritage.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{there is}} nothing {{scientific}} about our currency and finance at all. It is a thing that has grown up and elaborated itself out of very simple beginnings {{in the course of}} a century or so. Three hundred years ago the edifice had hardly begun to rise from the ground, most property was real, most people lived directly on the land, most business was on a cash basis, <b>oversea</b> <b>trade</b> was a proportionately small affair, labour was locally fixed. Most of the world was at the level at which much of China remains to-day--able to get along without even coinage. It was a rudimentary world from the point of view of the modern financier and industrial organiser. Well, on that rude, secure basis there has now been piled the most chancy and insecurely experimental system of conventions and assumptions about money and credit it is possible to imagine. There has grown up a vast system of lending and borrowing, a world-wide extension of joint-stock enterprises that involve at last the most fantastic relationships. I find myself, for example, owning (partially, at least) a bank in New Zealand, a railway in Cuba, another in Canada, several in Brazil, an electric power plant in the City of Westminster, and so on, and I use these stocks and shares as a sort of interest-bearing money. If I want money to spend, I sell a railway share much as one might change a hundred-pound banknote; if I have more cash than I need immediately I buy a few shares. I perceive that the value of these shares oscillates, sometimes rather gravely, and that the value of the alleged money on the cheques I get also oscillates as compared with the things I want to buy; that, indeed, the whole system (which has only existed for a couple of centuries or so, and which keeps on getting higher and giddier) is perpetually swaying and quivering and bending and sagging; but it is only when such a great crisis occurs as that of 1907 that it enters my mind that possibly there is no limit to these oscillations, that possibly the whole vast accidental edifice will presently come smashing down.|$|E

The Austrian Lloyd was running regular services from Trieste to the Near East, India, China and the Far East, Brazil, the USA and Northern Europe.

50|$|Ikuta Shigeru {{presented}} {{an even more}} radical interpretation of the Sanzan period. He dismissed Okinawa's later narratives as mere legends. He argued that the King of Nanzan was under control of the King of Chūzan from the very beginning. Due to lack of sufficient evidence, he refrained from determining Hokuzan's relationship with Chūzan. He related these alleged polities to Ming China's haijin (sea ban) policy. Unlike the preceding Mongol Yuan Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty prohibited Chinese merchants from engaging in <b>oversea</b> <b>trade.</b> In order to maintain international trade that covers the vast area from Southeast Asia to Japan and Korea, they set up tribute-paying missions under the names of foreign kings. At their height, they used three dummy names. As Okinawa's importance in international trade decreased, the names of Hokuzan and Nanzan ceased to be used.|$|E
50|$|Much {{to their}} surprise, {{with the aid}} of war-balloons, the Franco-Slavonian League managed not only to cut all <b>oversea</b> <b>trade</b> to and from Britain, but also {{arranged}} a successful landing of troops on British soil, aiming to take London as the heart of Anglo-Saxon world. Under siege and with no allies left, Britain fought the last battle furiously, but the siege cut all food supply and left the Old Lion with no other choice but to accept a newly sent proposal from the Terrorists. At the height of his power, the Russian Tsar was already looking forward to Britain's surrender and was taken by surprise as the new army arose in Britain: the army called by the Terrorists, just like they did in America. Even greater was the Tsar's surprise when he realized that terrorists had thousands of their men in his own ranks. Aided with air-ships and troops from American section, the Brotherhood - now acting as the Anglo-Saxon Federation - swiftly destroyed almost all Russian, French and Italian troops, forcing a surrender of all the armies and ending the world war in just two days.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{potential}} measures generalised accessibility but {{the use of}} {{this model}} depends {{on the extent to which}} the different regions within the defined area do in fact trade with all areas in the system. From inland freight data for 1982 and 1983, and <b>oversea</b> <b>trade</b> figures for 1978, some aspects of the actual behaviour of regional trade flows are explored in this paper. At the standard region level, the "peripheral" regions are relatively self-sufficient and also engage in <b>oversea</b> <b>trade</b> to a comparatively large extent. However, whereas the "peripheral" regions draw a large proportion of their imports from deep-sea locations, their exports are biased toward the near Continent. From the evidence it can be seen that the economic potential model is substantially inadequate, in that the firms in the regions do in fact adapt in some measure to regional circumstances. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBAK Je-gha {{is one of}} {{distinguished}} Silhakjas (Korean pragmatic Confucianists) in the 18 th century in Korea. The most important thoughts of BAK Je-gha lay in his words that properties could be increased by way of investment like a well and agriculture is like intestines and the wagon is like {{blood vessels in the}} human body. These are foresighted in that it nearly equals to Say's words; “supply can create demand itself”, and nowadays logistics cost can affect competitiveness of industrial enterprises. No one except BAK Je-gha gave an idea that government could increase its national wealth and power through home and foreign trade in Korea, though someone mentioned the importance of commerce. Even Adam Smith, contemporary great economist of BAK Je-gha, gave an emphasis on domestic trade rather than <b>oversea</b> <b>trade,</b> for he wanted to point out defects of mercantilism and to assert the advantages of free trade. He also explained that capitals are increased by parsimony. As seen above, BAK's thoughts on distribution and commerce had originalities in comparing with those of contemporary Korean Confucianists and even Smith, father of modern economics...|$|E
