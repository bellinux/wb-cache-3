Approximately 220 bands and solo performers from throughout the New Hampshire seacoast and surrounding area signed up, and produced a total of 165 CDs. In early March of that year a wrap-up and listening party was held, beginning at the Portsmouth Music Hall, and moving out to several other venues, including The Press Room, the Red Door, and the now defunct Muddy River Smokehouse.|$|R
5000|$|Bertha Honoré {{married the}} Chicago millionaire Potter Palmer in 1870. She was twenty-one {{and he was}} forty-four. Palmer was a Quaker {{merchant}} {{who had come to}} Chicago after failing twice in business. In Chicago he learned to please his customers, many of whom were women. He made customer service a priority and carried everything from dry goods <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latest French fashions for ladies. Palmer sold his vast store to a consortium and it would eventually become Marshall Field's. Palmer then opened a luxury hotel, Palmer House and invested in real estate, eventually owning a vast portfolio of properties. Soon after their marriage, the Chicago Fire wiped out the Palmer House and most of their holdings, and Bertha Palmer had <b>to</b> rush <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>wire</b> <b>the</b> east so that Palmer could re-establish credit, borrow money and rebuild his holdings. Bertha Palmer was unusually poised for one so young, and together the Palmers re-established their fortune and despite her age, she quickly rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of Chicago society. [...] "She was beautiful, dashing, quick, and smart; and more than that, she was sure of herself," [...] wrote historian Ernest Poole.|$|R

40|$|Spin-wave modes in {{magnetic}} transition-metal nanowires having diameters {{of about}} 10 nm and lengths {{on the order}} of 1 µm are investigated by model calculations. There are quasicontinuous modes with k vectors parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> axis and discrete modes with k vectors perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> axis. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> small cross section of <b>the</b> <b>wires,</b> <b>the</b> perpendicular modes can be ignored in many cases and the low-temperature behavior of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> is quasi one-dimensional. Using an analytic approach and exploiting the analogy between micromagnetism and quantum mechanics it is shown that all spin-wave modes with k vectors parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> axis are localized. The spin-wave localization is a micromagnetic analog <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anderson localization of conduction electrons due to randomness in less than two dimensions, and, as in the electron analogy, arbitrarily small disorder is sufficient <b>to</b> cause <b>the</b> localization of all modes...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus and method that combines a signal generator and a passive signal receiver to detect and record the path of partially or completely concealed electrical <b>wiring</b> without disturbing <b>the</b> concealing surface. The signal generator applies a series of electrical pulses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> selected <b>wiring</b> of interest. <b>The</b> applied pulses create a magnetic field about <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> that can be detected by a coil contained within the signal receiver. An audible output connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receiver and driven by the coil reflects the receiver`s position with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> <b>The</b> receiver`s audible signal is strongest when the receiver is directly above <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> and <b>the</b> long axis of the receiver`s coil is parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> A marking means is mounted on <b>the</b> receiver <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> as <b>the</b> receiver is directed over the wiring`s concealing surface.

40|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{accuracy}} of results for wires moved laterally from mesh edges can be greatly improved by taking account {{of the behavior of}} the field in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> Also, <b>the</b> distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> can be adjusted within a cell by using a general second-order difference form for the derivative. Making <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> location completely independent of the mesh would require <b>the</b> additional ability <b>to</b> tilt <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edges. This seems to be a considerably more difficult problem than moving <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> laterally, since <b>the</b> component of the mesh field parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> gets mixed with the larger radial electric field due <b>to</b> charge on <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> Simply averaging <b>the</b> mesh fields did not seem to work well, except in the case where <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was tilted in one coordinate plane, and the mesh fields above and below the plane of <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> on edges orthogonal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> normal, could be averaged.

The dipolar interaction field opposes the self-demagnetization field of an isolated single <b>wire</b> which keeps <b>the</b> magnetization parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> axis.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of arrays of electrodeposited Co nanowires {{have been studied}} by ferromagnetic resonance {{as a function of}} the electrolytic bath acidity and the plating current intensity.

Such wires show a significant decrease of the effective anisotropy due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> competition between the magnetocrystalline and the shape anisotropy that can be as low as 4. 3 kOe.
