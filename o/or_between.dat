5|$|An {{ambulance}} is {{a vehicle}} for transportation, from <b>or</b> <b>between</b> places of treatment, {{and in some instances}} will also provide out of hospital medical care to the patient.

5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, <b>or</b> <b>between</b> two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within <b>or</b> <b>between</b> species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Express routes run {{between the}} {{outskirts}} of the city and downtown <b>or</b> <b>between</b> major rail stations and other points in the city. These routes typically run only during peak hours, going inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening, except the 76X Marin Headlands Express, which runs on weekends and holidays; and the 83X Mid-Market Express, which runs in both directions during peak hours. Asterisked (*) routes indicate that they run only during morning peak hours.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} a snake {{held by the}} healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, {{but the majority of}} atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body <b>or</b> <b>between</b> his legs.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} <b>or</b> <b>between</b> a nanotube {{and another}} material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E

5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, <b>or</b> <b>between</b> physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, <b>or</b> <b>between</b> opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

In medieval times, coins were minted at Sigtuna, and legend {{suggests}} it was the royal seat for a time, signified by the crown on its arms.

5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to {{sizes and shapes}} that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter <b>or</b> <b>between</b> grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked.

The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
