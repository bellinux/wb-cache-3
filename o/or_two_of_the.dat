5|$|From 1643 to 1659, {{he served}} as master mason for the {{construction}} of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers in 1648. Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within a block <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Their bodies were carried {{outside to the}} bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol. The corpses were set on fire as the Red Army {{shelling}} continued. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} conference season, the Big Ten named one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Players <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Week and one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> Freshmen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Week each Monday (except Martin Luther King Day, when the awards were delayed until Tuesday).|$|R

5|$|The 1st Airborne Division had the {{required}} airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider borne anti-tank weapons <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parachute brigades and the airlanding brigade on day one. However, instead {{the vast majority}} of the division's vehicles and heavy equipment, plus 1st Parachute Brigade, most of 1st Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops would be on the first lift. The airlanding brigade would remain at the landing grounds and defend them during the following day's lifts, while the parachute brigade set out alone to capture the bridges and ferry crossing on the River Rhine.|$|E

5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack by one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's pieces, {{it is said}} to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|Waddell was {{stationed}} at Fort Dobbs {{on the night}} of February 27, 1760 when a force of Cherokee attacked the blockhouse. In the ensuing battle, which was the only battle that occurred at Fort Dobbs, between 10 and 12 Cherokee and one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial militia were wounded.|$|E
25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings. An investigation revealed that the turbine section was suffering from a vibration resonance problem, leading to the turbine blade failures. The blades were strengthened and modified to dampen the vibrations. The engine, and the aircraft, returned to service in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Stem tubers {{generally}} {{start off}} as enlargements of the hypocotyl {{section of a}} seedling but also sometimes include the first node <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epicotyl and the upper section of the root. The stem tuber has a vertical orientation with {{one or a few}} vegetative buds on the top and fibrous roots produced on the bottom from a basal section, typically the stem tuber has an oblong rounded shape.|$|E

25|$|Often, one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urinals, {{typically}} {{at one end}} of a long row, will {{be mounted}} lower than the others; they are meant for the disabled and other users who cannot reach the regular urinals. In facilities where people of various heights are present, such as schools, urinals that extend down to floor level may be used to allow anyone of any height to use any urinal.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} was due for replacement in 2007, and {{a budget}} was set, but on 12 December 2006 it collapsed, as one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporting piles broke. The Sydney Ports Corporation employed Waterways Constructions {{to reconstruct the}} lighthouse. The new tower was designed to look as similar as possible to its predecessor, using the salvaged and renovated lantern house, and a new lower section. Reconstruction completed and the light returned to operation on 18 December 2008.|$|E
25|$|The telenovela, a shorter-form {{format of}} serial melodrama, shares some {{thematic}} and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, {{enough that the}} colloquialism Spanish soap opera has arisen to describe the format. The chief {{difference between the two}} is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.|$|E

25|$|Their tactic was {{to advance}} {{simultaneously}} {{from all sides}} targeting a single central objective. This {{would lead to the}} dispersion of enemy forces and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that even if one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.|$|E
25|$|Scientists do {{not know}} the minimum number of {{parameters}} for determination of habitability potential, but they are certain it is greater than one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors in the table below. Similarly, for each group of parameters, the habitability threshold for each is to be determined. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly. There are no full-Mars simulations published yet that include all of the biocidal factors combined.|$|E
25|$|During the Russian Civil War, the {{littoral}} area saw sporadic armed clashes {{involving the}} Red Army, White movement forces, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia. As {{a result of}} the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a railway which runs from Tuapse to Georgia within a kilometer <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastline. Although this branch of the Northern Caucasus Railway may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.|$|E
