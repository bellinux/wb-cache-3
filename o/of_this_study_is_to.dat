50|$|His current project, Shot Glass: Mirrors in Movies (forthcoming), pursues a {{study of}} more than four hundred movie scenes in which {{characters}} react to their mirror images. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> discern how personal identity is handled, how “self” is done. Rather than exploring the ways in which people conceive of their selves, this study inquires into the presuppositions of people who attend to their mirrors, sometimes preening, sometimes wincing, attacking, or even shooting the glass they see. Shot Glass concludes that self is far from simple; it is fraught with hidden forces, not unlike our everyday performances of speech, sign, music, and angling.|$|E
