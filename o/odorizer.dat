50|$|An <b>odorizer</b> is {{a device}} that adds an odorant to a gas. The most common type is one that adds a {{mercaptan}} liquid into natural gas distribution systems so that leaks can be readily detected. Other types {{have been used for}} carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.|$|E
5000|$|Notification Appliances utilize audible, visible, tactile, textual or even {{olfactory}} stimuli (<b>odorizer)</b> {{to alert}} the occupants {{of the need to}} evacuate or take action {{in the event of a}} fire or other emergency. Evacuation signals may consist of simple appliances that transmit uncoded information, coded appliances that transmit a predetermined pattern, and or appliances that transmit audible and visible textual information such as live or pre-recorded instructions, and illuminated message displays.|$|E
50|$|Wick type <b>odorizers</b> {{can be very}} small, odorizing the gas for as few as one gas {{customer}} to much larger ones that can odorize the gas for a small town (10,000 MCF). They use a wick which {{is very similar to}} those used in a kerosene lantern. The odorant is drawn up the wick from the container and into the gas stream.|$|R
50|$|Fuel gas is {{contrasted with}} liquid fuels and from solid fuels, though some fuel gases are {{liquefied}} for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature has advantages, avoiding {{the difficulty of}} transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it also has limitation. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading {{to the risk of}} a gas explosion. For this reason, <b>odorizers</b> are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell.|$|R
50|$|Fuel gas is {{any one of}} {{a number}} of fuels that under {{ordinary}} conditions are gaseous. Many fuel gases are composed of hydrocarbons (such as methane or propane), hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential heat energy or light energy that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with liquid fuels and from solid fuels, though some fuel gases are liquefied for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a gas explosion. For this reason, <b>odorizers</b> are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is natural gas.|$|R
50|$|For {{very high}} volume systems (and for some smaller volume systems), liquid {{injection}} odorizers are being manufactured. These odorizers {{work by the}} addition of small amounts of liquid odorant to the moving gas. A pump that can be controlled to give the range of addition rates necessary is a very important aspect of this type of <b>odorizer.</b> Computer control to monitor flow rates and vary injection rate is {{a significant part of the}} more modern versions of this. Previous versions worked off a variety of schemes to control the odorization level.|$|E
50|$|Michels {{originally}} {{planned to take}} advantage of the gas infrastructure industry and then move on to something else, but Michels Pipeline Construction gradually grew to the point that the entire company was rebranded Michels Corporation in 2001. This allowed Michels Pipeline Construction to live on in its current form, where it works in the following areas: mainline and distribution pipeline construction, interstate and intrastate pipelines, compressor stations/pumping stations, metering and regulator stations, maintenance and repair, gathering systems and storage facilities, <b>odorizer</b> facilities and river crossings, emergency repair and steam lines, high voltage underground construction and water lines.|$|E
50|$|Odorizers {{are used}} in carbon dioxide fire {{extinguisher}} systems, the <b>odorizer</b> assembly injects wintergreen oil into the carbon dioxide stream when the agent is discharged. Approximately 50 cc of wintergreen oil contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a protective housing attached to the discharge piping {{in such a manner}} as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge, atomizing the oil and dispersing it. The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, poppers {{are widely}} {{available}} and frequently (legally) sold in gay clubs/bars, sex shops, drug paraphernalia head shops, over the Internet and on markets. It is illegal under Medicines Act 1968 to sell them advertised for human consumption, {{and in order to}} bypass this, they are usually sold as <b>odorizers.</b> In the U.S., originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937, amyl nitrite remained so until 1960, when the Food and Drug Administration removed the prescription requirement due to its safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use. Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the U.S. by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law includes an exception for commercial purposes. The term commercial purpose is defined to mean any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects. The law came into effect in 1990. Visits to retail outlets selling these products reveal that some manufacturers have since reformulated their products to abide by the regulations, through the use of the legal cyclohexyl nitrite as the primary ingredient in their products, which are sold as video head cleaners, polish removers, or room odorants.|$|R
40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., nonstick cooking spray and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room <b>odorizers).</b> (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research and comparative analysis of odorizers of natural gas which are designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its odorization in order to identify the leakages in technological systems of transportation, distribution and consumption till the moment of achievements of explosive limit or harmful concentrations by introducing a substance with a strong specific smell. On the results of fundamental analysis of the existing odorizers of natural gas new technical solutions are proposed which allowed to create odorizers which effectively operate under different conditions of operation and quality of odorant. Such systems have high accuracy of gas odorization offline with minimal involvement of the staff. Particular attention is paid to high -efficiency nonfilter <b>odorizer</b> of natural gas. The main advantage of such installation is absence of the filter to clear out the odorant of dirt and ice. The principle of the installation differs from other flowodorizers in the fact that pump delivers not liquid but natural gas. If there are heating elements it can operate offline while operating personnel work is focused exclusively on refilling of odorant storage capacity. ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ????, ??????? ????????????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ? ????? ????????????? ?????? ? ??????????????? ???????? ???????????????, ????????????? ? ???????????, ? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????? ????????????? ???????. ?? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ????, ?????????? ????? ??????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ??????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ? ???????? ????????. ????? ????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ???? ? ?????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????. ?????? ???????? ??????? ????????????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????. ??????? ????????????? ????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ??????? ???????? ?? ????? ? ?????? ????. ??????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ???????????????? ???, ??? ????? ???????????? ?? ????????, ? ????????? ???. ??? ??????? ? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ????? ??????????????? ? ?????????????????? ??????, ??? ???? ?????? ????????????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ????????...|$|E
40|$|Inhalants are {{a diverse}} group of {{volatile}} substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. While other abused substances can be inhaled, the term “inhalants ” is used to describe substances that are rarely, if ever, taken by any other route of administration. A variety of products common in the home and workplace contain substances that can be inhaled to get high; however, people do not typically think of these products (e. g., spray paints, glues, and cleaning fluids) as drugs because they were never intended to induce intoxicating effects. Yet young children and adolescents can easily obtain these extremely toxic substances, and are among those most likely to abuse them. In fact, more 8 th graders have tried inhalants than any other illicit drug. 1 What Types of Products are Abused as Inhalants? Inhalants generally fall into the following categories: Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, lighter fluid Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—a special class of inhalants that are used primarily as sexual enhancers Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures.
