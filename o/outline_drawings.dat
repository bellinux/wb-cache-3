25|$|Other {{well-known}} vase {{painters of}} the time are the Painter of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton Painter, the Painter of Munich 1410 and the Swing Painter (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is {{not considered to be}} a very good artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists. The work of the Rycroft Painter bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses <b>outline</b> <b>drawings.</b> The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted. The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with a new type of belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three Line Group. The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos Painter, the Madrid Painter and the imaginative Priam Painter.|$|E

[...] Dry, rigorous, and technically detailed in its language, the book was not considered to be accessible by the general reading public.

[...] The tradition of tinted drawings or <b>outline</b> <b>drawings</b> with ink supplemented by coloured wash was distinctively English, dating back to the Anglo-Saxon art of the mid-10th century, and connected with the English Benedictine Reform of the period.

60|$|All merely <b>outlined</b> <b>drawings</b> are bad, for {{the simple}} reason, that an artist of any power can always do more, and tell more, by quitting his {{outlines}} occasionally, and scratching in a few lines for shade, than he can by restricting himself to outline only. Hence the fact of his so restricting himself, whatever may be the occasion, shows {{him to be a}} bad draughtsman, and not to know how to apply his power economically. This hard law, however, bears only on drawings meant to remain in the state in which you see them; not on those which were meant to be proceeded with, or for some mechanical use. It is sometimes necessary to draw pure outlines, as an incipient arrangement of a composition, to be filled up afterwards with color, or to be pricked through and used as patterns or tracings; but if, with no such ultimate object, making the drawing wholly for its own sake, and meaning it to remain in the state he leaves it, an artist restricts himself to outline, he is a bad draughtsman, and his work is bad. There is no exception to this law. A good artist habitually sees masses, not edges, and can in every case make his drawing more expressive (with any given quantity of work) by rapid shade than by contours; so that all good work whatever is more or less touched with shade, and more or less interrupted as outline.|$|R

6000|$|Possess yourself, therefore, of any cheap work on botany {{containing}} outline {{plates of}} leaves and flowers, {{it does not matter}} whether bad or good: [...] "Baxter's British Flowering Plants" [...] is quite good enough. Copy any of the simplest outlines, first with a soft pencil, following it, by the eye, as nearly as you can; if it does not look right in proportions, rub out and correct it, always by the eye, till you think it is right: when you have got it to your mind, lay tracing-paper on the book, on this paper trace the outline you have been copying, and apply it to your own; and having thus ascertained the faults, correct them all patiently, till you have got it as nearly accurate as may be. Work with a very soft pencil, and do not rub out so hard[200] as to spoil the surface of your paper; never mind how dirty the paper gets, but do not roughen it; and let the false outlines alone where they do not really interfere with the true one. It is a good thing to accustom yourself to hew and shape your drawing out of a dirty piece of paper. When you have got it as right as you can, take a quill pen, not very fine at the point; rest your hand on a book about {{an inch and a half}} thick, so as to hold the pen long; and go over your pencil outline with ink, raising your pen point as seldom as possible, and never leaning more heavily on one part of the line than on another. In most <b>outline</b> <b>drawings</b> of the present day, parts of the curves are thickened to give an effect of shade; all such outlines are bad, but they will serve well enough for your exercises, provided you do not imitate this character: it is better, however, if you can, to choose a book of pure outlines. It does not in the least matter whether your pen outline be thin or thick; but it matters greatly that it should be equal, not heavier in one place than in another. The power to be obtained is that of drawing an even line slowly and in any direction; all dashing lines, or approximations to penmanship, are bad. The pen should, as it were, walk slowly over the ground, and you should be able at any moment to stop it, or to turn it in any other direction, like a well-managed horse.|$|E

These drawings are the results of a three-year long course of "Architecture, Drawing and Ornate" that was taught in Cagliari by Prof. Arch. Gaetano Cima (1805 - 1878). From the analysis of these drawings it is possible to make some remarks both of historic and methodological aspects. It is very interesting how the students carried out the architectural composition using geometric constructions. The marks of the geometric constructions are yet visible on many of the drawings. In the work presented here, these tiny signs are used as instruments for reconstructing, using the accuracy of CAD, the <b>outlining</b> process. <b>Drawings</b> were sorted according to the rules of construction found for each architectonic composition: golden section, dynamic symmetry (root 2 rectangle), squares and triangles, etc. The classification of the graphic analysis was then related to the note of Prof. Cima and the books he made use of to teach architecture, in order to value affinity and differences. The aim of the work is to regain Cima's teaching method from the graphic results of his students and to establish a method that could be applied to similar cases where architectural drawings are the only documents to regain the outline of a building...|$|R

In addition, it was expected that children would adopt a drawing-by-parts strategy for the combinations, irrespective of actual viewpoint, resulting in ‘twisted perspective’. The data confirmed these predictions with the exception that there were no age effects. A second experiment, undertaken to resolve the ambiguity in the drawings of one of the model bodies, found that a model with more distinctive contour elicited more typical drawings. The results of the first experiment were strongly confirmed. The relationship of the findings to the phenomenon of size constancy is discussed.

The design of the actual new German city over the site of Warsaw was devised by Hubert Gross. The project was soon incorporated into Generalplan Ost.

Primary characteristics used to identify algae is based upon pigmentation of the plastid and the number and position of the flagella as well as gross morphology. The focus of this research project was to develop a photographic system which would permit the recording of living organisms with various forms of microscopy with correct color and with arrested flagellar movement. These parameters dictated the use of an electronic flash source with metering and control system after the light has passed through the microscope.

The light is measured off-the-film so that the combined light from the microscope and flash are included. The flash is quenched and shutter closed based upon the combined reading.
