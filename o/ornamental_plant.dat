5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant.</b> The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively {{medicinal}} plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant,</b> Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the perception of outdoor <b>ornamental</b> <b>plants.</b> It examines whether methods used for perception research {{in the social sciences}} may also be applied to such specific material as outdoor <b>ornamental</b> <b>plants.</b> In an experiment involving 56 participants we tested the use of an adjective checklist, which consisted of 78 adjectives describing the features of 15 outdoor <b>ornamental</b> <b>plants.</b> The participants chose the adjectives suitable for describing individual plants with varying frequency; in subsequent research only those properties were considered which were chosen in more than 10 % of the cases. An examination of the frequency of chosen features showed that people are favorably disposed towards plants; properties with negative meanings were rarely marked. By using statistical methods of classification into groups we determined which features of outdoor <b>ornamental</b> <b>plants</b> aggregate into larger, semantically similar groups.

Archaeologists at Poplar Forest found stains in the ground indicating areas in which trees were previously planted, and their goal is to analyze the levels of charcoal and pollen to determine which areas were most likely the original location(s) for the paper mulberry trees. Other ongoing and future excavation plans include the area surrounding an antebellum slave cabin as well as Jefferson’s <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> nursery.|$|E

Many cut flower and <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> growers come to display their products and there is the coronation of the Queen of Flowers. Other events include agricultural displays, parades with floats, dances, crafts, cockfights, sporting events and more.|$|E
25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{was used}} as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> in European gardens at least as far back as 1773. It was in common use in 1828, and Charles Darwin grew it in his garden in the 1840s. The plant is still widely used in gardens in Europe and Asia because of its {{striking}} black flowers. It is also used to add height to a garden, and as a means of providing a darker backdrop to more brightly colored plants and flowers. The large seed pods weather winter well (tending not to drop in high wind), and it can be a striking winter ornamental seedpod plant as well. However, it is difficult to find and very expensive in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Mexico City {{has about}} eighty {{specialty}} markets partially or fully dedicated {{to one or}} few classes of items. The San Juan Market in the historic center specialized in gourmet foods such as the best produce and expensive and unusual meats and cheeses. Mercado Jamaica was opened in 1957 on chinampa land along Canal de la Viga. It {{is best known for}} the sale of cut flowers and ornamental plants with a large section dedicated to produce. Mercado de Sonora sells dishes, live animals and party items, but it is best known for its sections dedicated to herbal medicines and the occult. La Lagunilla has a building dedicated to furniture and another to clothing. This market is also known for its Sunday antiques market. Other specialty markets include one dedicated to candy in Candelaria and an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> market in the ecological reserve in Xochimilco.|$|E
25|$|Xochimilco Ecological Park and Plant Market is {{a natural}} reserve or park, with a thirteenhectare plant market, the largest in Latin America. The park and market {{are located in the}} {{southern}} Mexico City borough of Xochimilco, about 23km south of the historic center of the city. The park was inaugurated in 1993, on chinampas (artificial lake islands) which had been previously declared as part of a World Heritage site. However, the area’s ecology was badly degraded, and the park was established in order to revitalize and preserve the ecosystem. Success has been mixed. While much of the wetlands have been recharged, pollution and illegal settlements in the area remain as threats. As the park needs to be self-sustaining economically, {{there are a number of}} ways that the park raises money. One of the best known of these is the Xochimilco or Cuemanco Plant Market, which rents stalls to <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> producers/sellers near the main entrance of the park.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to its use as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant,</b> the tree of heaven is also used for its wood, medicinal properties, and as a host plant to feed silkworms of the moth Samia cynthia, which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to take dye. This type of silk is known under various names: [...] "pongee", [...] "eri silk" [...] and [...] "Shantung silk", the last name being derived from Shandong Province in China where this silk is often produced. Its production is particularly {{well known in the}} Yantai region of that province. The moth has also been introduced in the United States.|$|E
500|$|In Chinese culture Narcissus tazetta subsp. chinensis (Chinese sacred lilies), {{which can}} be grown indoors, is widely used as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant.</b> It was {{probably}} introduced to China by Arab traders travelling the Silk Road prior to the Song Dynasty for medicinal use. Spring-flowering, they became associated with Chinese New Year, signifying good fortune, prosperity and good luck {{and there are many}} legends in Chinese culture associated with Narcissus. In contrast to the West, narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art, however, Zhao Mengjian in the Southern Song Dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi. [...] Narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to Japanese bonsai The Japanese novel Narcissu contains many references to the narcissus, where the main characters set out for the famed narcissus fields on Awaji Island.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the lethal}} {{potential}} of Narcissus alkaloids, {{they have been}} used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be N. poeticus [...] and N. tazetta are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer. In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a pessary prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use. The bulbs of N. poeticus contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages. In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant</b> but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine.

500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant,</b> it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.|$|E
500|$|In 1784, {{not long}} after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were {{forwarded}} to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia. In both Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a street tree, and by 1840 it was available in most nurseries. The tree was separately brought to California in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who came during the California Gold Rush. It has escaped cultivation in all areas where it was introduced, but most extensively in the United States. It has naturalised across much of Europe, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the Pannonian region (i.e. southeastern Central Europe around the Danube river basin from Austria, Slovakia and Hungary south to the Balkan ranges) and most countries of the Mediterranean Basin. In Montenegro and Albania A. altissima is widespread in both rural and urban areas and while in the first it was introduced as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>plant,</b> it very soon invaded native ecosystems with disastrous results and became an invasive species. Ailanthus has also been introduced to Argentina, Australia (where it is a declared weed in New South Wales and Victoria), New Zealand (where it is listed under the National Pest Plant Accord and is classed an [...] "unwanted organism"), the Middle East and in some countries in South Asia such as Pakistan. In South Africa it is listed as an invasive species which must be controlled, or removed and destroyed.|$|E
