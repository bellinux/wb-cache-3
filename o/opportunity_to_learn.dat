40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define the concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (OTL) as a {{theoretical}} category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating <b>opportunities,</b> and (c) <b>to</b> compare differences in defining and using <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U. S., where the concept originated. In {{the first part of}} the study, a specific historical development of defining <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is presented. Initially, the <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, the scope of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part of the study <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that the concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in the U. S. primarily covers complex research-based analyses of the relationship between teaching and learning. This contrasts with the use of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} on OTL has largely {{focused on the}} factors affecting students’ exposure <b>to</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and their disposition or ability to take up and actualize those opportunities. Much of this has centered on the uneven distribution of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> across demographic groups and other student populations (e.g., Flores 2007; Oakes 1990). This work has {{shed light on the}} direct connection between divergent mathematical outcomes across student populations and the unequal distribution of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> mathematics afforded <b>to</b> these populations. Additionally, this works highlights the role of students’ mathematical dispositions in actualizing these <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (e.g., Gresalfi 2009), as well as the role of different pedagogical environments in providing different amounts of and types of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (e.g., Yackel et al. 1991). Together, this indicates that factors stemming from students’ backgrounds, their mathematical dispositions, and their classroom experiences contribute to how they experience and actualize content coverage, exposure, and emphasis. In other words, a student’s perceptions of, and ability to capitalize on, OTLs depend on both the individual student and his/her instruction.|$|R

Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issues features Chloe Sullivan referencing that each team member has established an info hub on their own territory, with communication systems linked to the Watchtower. In the second issue, Lex Luthor discovers that Queen Industries is building a facility {{on the far side}} of Earth's moon as a base for the Justice League, and its construction is under John Jones' supervision. Despite having died after her encounter with Lex Luthor, the League's liaison is Tess Mercer, whose consciousness is revealed to be bonded to her half-brother's mind. Luthor sees this as an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the heroes' secrets before removing Tess from his mind, and creates measures to prevent them from finding out his situations with Tess. Despite his efforts, Tess still manage to send her message to the League of her predicaments with Lex, and they extract her consciousness from him and uploaded it to the Watchtower computer system as a temporary home for her mind.|$|E

40|$|Professional {{development}} (PD) is key {{to improving}} mathematics teaching and learning in the middle grades. Many PD projects and initiatives have been undertaken across the United States. Yet, we {{know very little about}} what teachers learn in and through such PD, nor about what those who conduct the PD might be learning as well. This knowledge gap hinders efforts to design and deliver effective professional <b>learning</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> mathematics teachers. This study addresses this gap by analyzing a selection of commonly used PD curriculum materials <b>to</b> ascertain the <b>opportunities</b> they provide for middle school mathematics teachers <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> ideas central <b>to</b> improving their instructional practice. Specifically it focuses on teachers’ <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about: the mathematical topics of proportionality, rational numbers, and linear functions; using multiple representations of mathematical ideas; and using cognitively demanding mathematical tasks in instruction. Due to the important role that professional developers play in supporting teacher learning and their limited <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> do so, this study also explores the ways the curriculum materials are designed <b>to</b> support the <b>learning</b> of professional developers – that is, {{the extent to which they}} are educative. The study employed a survey to identify the PD curriculum materials most frequently used with middle school mathematics teachers in NSF-MSP projects across the country. Two analytic frameworks were developed <b>to</b> analyze the <b>learning</b> <b>opportunities</b> provided <b>to</b> teachers and professional developers in the curriculum materials. The analysis of teachers’ learning opportunities revealed extensive <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about proportionality, moderate <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about rational numbers, and scarce <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about linear functions; mixed <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about using multiple representations, making strong connections between symbols, diagrams, and verbal descriptions, but little use of graphs; and mixed <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about using cognitively demanding tasks in instruction, providing <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> reflect on the pedagogical issues associated with such use. The analysis of professional developers’ learning opportunities revealed wide variance in the extent to which the materials are educative, with some materials offering very few opportunities and others offering extensive learning opportunities. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
