5|$|The team's {{original}} alternate logo was {{the foot}} of a Sasquatch/Bigfoot and was seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the Avalanche's home and away jerseys. The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, {{prior to the start of}} the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme. The logo will be featured on a patch located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the team's uniforms, along with a 20th anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} Iraqi {{account that}} the Assyrian casualties were sustained during a short battle with Kurdish and Arab tribes has been discredited by all historians.

5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the company.|$|E

5|$|Starting in July 2000, the Senators reused the {{alternate}} logo on another third jersey, designed by Ottawa firm Hoselton Brunet, this one black {{with red and}} gold sleeves and a gold stripe with laurel leaves {{along the bottom of}} the jersey. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> was {{a modified version of the}} original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign, which the management liked. Like the original logo, this design was leaked onto the Internet. This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with {{a black and white}} striped lining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|The male has mainly black upperparts, a white crown, {{forehead}} and supercilium. There are large white patches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and primaries, and the outermost tail feathers are also white. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange on the flanks and breast. The iris is brown, {{the bill is}} black and the legs are dark brown or black. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish-black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump, a paler grey forehead, barred off-white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches.|$|E

5|$|The team {{adopted a}} new home kit, which {{featured}} red shirts with white collars, white trims <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and white sleeves that included red trims. York started the season wearing red shorts with white trims, but these were replaced {{later in the season}} with navy blue shorts with white trims. The home kit also included red shorts with white trims. The away kit, retained from the previous season, comprised light blue shirts with white horizontal stripes, light blue shorts and light blue socks. Pryers Solicitors continued as shirt sponsors for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E

5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs and bottom of the body {{as well as a number}} of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs and bottom of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E

5|$|In 1852, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} life-sized concrete model of Megalosaurus for the exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked {{under the direction of}} Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that Megalosaurus would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s. Today, they are seen as a separate genus Becklespinax, but Owen referred them to Megalosaurus. The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time, at least in England, that ancient reptiles had existed.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> of their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} or great {{northern}} diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|E
