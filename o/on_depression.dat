25|$|The {{association}} between isotretinoin use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use. A {{number of studies}} have been conducted since then of the drug's effect <b>on</b> <b>depression,</b> psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects.|$|E
25|$|Major {{depressive}} {{disorder is}} believed to be due in part to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system. Antidepressants including ones with a similar mechanism of action as duloxetine, i.e. serotonin metabolism inhibition, cause a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine activity and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines; this mechanism may apply to duloxetine in its effect <b>on</b> <b>depression</b> but research on cytokines specific to duloxetine therapy is lacking.|$|E

25|$|The best {{supported}} {{treatment for}} tinnitus {{is a type}} of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which can be delivered via the internet or in person. It decreases the amount of stress those with tinnitus feel. These benefits appear to be independent of any effect <b>on</b> <b>depression</b> or anxiety in an individual. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) also shows promise in the treatment of tinnitus. Relaxation techniques may also be useful. A clinical protocol called Progressive Tinnitus Management for treatment of tinnitus has been developed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, a 2015 {{meta-analysis}} {{revealed that}} {{the positive effects of}} CBT <b>on</b> <b>depression</b> have been declining since 1977. The overall results showed two different declines in effect sizes: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons. The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.|$|E

25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect <b>on</b> <b>depression</b> immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) desensitized somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E
500|$|Heather Hogan of Autostraddle lauded the miniseries for [...] "color {{in some of}} Marceline's past, answer lots of {{questions}} about her relationship with Bonnie, and promis her a richer future."

[...] Brandon Russell of TechnoBuffalo wrote, [...] "The miniseries does an excellent job of exploring themes of depression, change, and forgiveness." [...] Russell praised the miniseries for showing Marceline's emotional transformation, noting that Marceline's momentary depression in [...] "The Dark Cloud" [...] at the futility of her plight is [...] "a reminder that, although change is hard, it's necessary for growth."
