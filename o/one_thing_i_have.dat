Corgan and Fabian separated in late 1995, and divorced in 1997. Corgan refused to discuss the subject in interviews, saying [...] "There is {{not and will not}} be any public record on my marriage – that's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to draw lines around." [...] He nevertheless described the circumstances of his marriage in his online Confessions in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Murray and Burton were {{confirmed}} as having declined {{to return to}} the series. For months, it was speculated {{that they would not be}} returning for the seventh season. Then, in February, The CW announced a series renewal without specifying which cast members had renewed their contracts. A video of Murray, seemingly unaware he was being filmed, saying the show was not bringing him back because they wanted to save money, and encouraging fans to rally behind him, intensified speculation. A video of Burton saying she would stay if she had creative control also surfaced, fueling speculation that The CW did not want to keep Burton on the show without Murray. To some fans, One Tree Hill without Murray and Burton sounded [...] "kind of like Seinfeld without Seinfeld... and Elaine". It elicited skepticism from fans who consider the heart of the show to be the dynamic between their characters, Lucas and Peyton. A TVGuide.com poll found that nearly half of respondents, however, were willing to take a [...] "wait and see" [...] approach to a revamped version of the series. In April, Schwann told a crowd in Paris that all of the actors had signed on for season 7, except for Murray and Burton. [...] "They're in negotiations right now and I know they've been offered great things, and hopefully they'll decide to come back", he said. [...] "If they don't, that's always a possibility... has made it through some of the riskier moves we've done." [...] In May, CW entertainment president Dawn Ostroff stated, [...] "We tried to get them to stay; we would have been thrilled if they wanted to." [...] She said that since Murray and Burton were moving on, Tree Hill now had to reinvent itself a bit– as it did in 2007, with the four-year flash-forward. [...] "A show going into its seventh year is very open to reinventing itself," [...] said Ostroff. [...] "And <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to give Mark Schwahn a lot of credit for is that he has kept the show so fresh all these years." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought myself {{prepared}} to meet God's will {{in any form}} it might come," [...] said Winthrop to me; [...] "but this <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgotten. It never entered into my head that my little Ally could die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> firmly {{resolved}} {{from the}} start," [...] Margaret confessed {{to me this}} morning in the cabin, when I released her from my arms, [...] "was that I would not permit you to make love to me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{hoped to}} make clear, that if Mr. Hodder {{had left the}} Church under these {{circumstances}} {{he would have made}} the Great Refusal. The situation which he faced demanded something of the sublime courage of his Master.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] said Gerald, [...] "there's <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to {{keep her}} {{jollying}} along all the time, so for goodness' sake don't go letting it out that we're engaged." ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{last they}} were alone again, with the candles above them, {{face to face with}} each other.

60|$|Mel. Do not omit it, I beseech you; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> such a tendre for the court, that I love it {{even from}} the drawing-room to the lobby, and can never be rebutée by any usage. But hark you, my dears; <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgot, of great concernment.|$|R

6000|$|... "Tell me, Eddy," [...] he asked, [...] "there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{always been}} curious about. How {{did you manage}} to keep that fellow Wolff when there wasn't a war on, and he wasn't {{breaking}} the law?" ...|$|E

60|$|But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgotten--the Sambre. In my {{excitement}} I {{never gave}} it a thought until I saw it, deep and broad, gleaming in the morning sunlight. It barred my path, and the Prussians howled behind me. I galloped to the brink, but the horse refused the plunge. I spurred him, but the bank was high and the stream deep.|$|R
60|$|And {{here was}} the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not {{calculated}} on--myself. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been five years in solitary. I was hideously weak. I weighed eighty-seven pounds. I was half blind. And I was immediately stricken with agoraphobia. I was affrighted by spaciousness. Five years in narrow walls had unfitted me for the enormous declivity of the stairway, for the vastitude of the prison yard.|$|R
5000|$|He went to Haiti, in 1953 (3) {{and worked}} as an auditor for the {{electric}} company at Port-au-Prince. In his own words: [...] "they {{were looking for a}} young person who could speak French and knew about accounting and I took the chance, though the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to fulfill the requirements was my youth, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no knowledge of French or accounting."

6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever you do, {{you will}} always be dear to me--that you know. But <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a right to say, which is, that at my age I am {{old enough to know}} what is best for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, it's {{too late}} to bother now. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> educated the boys; they wouldn't eat the hash you or Jake could cook. But I expect {{you want to get}} to work and we had better make the camp." ...|$|E

"When Insidious {{came out}} and was {{successful}} {{the story about the}} Warrens came to me and I was like, [...] "Oh, my gosh, this is really cool." ...But I didn't just want to make another ghost story or another supernatural film. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never explored was the chance to tell a story that's based on real-life characters, real-life people.
