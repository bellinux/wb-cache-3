The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the kinetics of body distribution, excretion and biotransformation of <b>o-anisidine</b> in rats following a single, intraperitoneal administration. Materials and Methods: The tissue distribution and excretion of <b>o-anisidine</b> following i. p. administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg was investigated using radiotracer [3 H]. Metabolism of <b>o-anisidine</b> was investigated in the rats following i. p. administration of a single dose of 50 mg/kg using GC/MS technique. Results: After 72 h, about 72 % of the given dose was excreted in urine. As indicated, urine proved to be the main route of tritium excretion. In all examined tissues, the highest concentrations of tritium were found 12 h after injection and the highest accumulation was detected in the liver, kidneys and in the muscle tissue. In urine, the following substances were identified and quantified by GC peak areas: N-acetyl- 2 -methoxyaniline and N-acetyl- 4 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxyaniline. Conclusions: Prolonged tritium retention observed in the majority of tissues indicated that <b>o-anisidine,</b> especially in the case of repeated exposure, might accumulate in the body.

PRAGUE 2010 Introduction - 2 - INTRODUCTION Aromatic amines are potent toxic or carcinogenic compounds, {{presenting a}} considerable {{danger to the}} human population (NTP, 1978; IARC, 1982; Garner et al., 1984). They are widely distributed environmental pollutants found in workplaces (e. g. in chemical industry), in emissions from diesel and gasoline engines and {{on the surface of}} ambient air particulate matter (NTP, 1978; IARC, 1982), where they add to local and regional pollution (car exhausts, technological spills). Their toxicity and carcinogenicity has been widely examined, but the knowledge in metabolism of several aromatic amines and their physiological effects in humans are still incomplete. This is also the case of <b>o-anisidine.</b> 2 -Methoxyaniline (<b>o-anisidine,</b> Fig. 1) is a potent carcinogen, causing tumours of the urinary bladder in both genders of F 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice (NTP, 1978; IARC, 1982).

Here, we investigated the ability of hepatic microsomes from rat and rabbit to metabolize this reactive compound. We found that N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine is metabolized by microsomes of both species mainly to o-aminophenol and a parent carcinogen, <b>o-anisidine,</b> whereas 2 -methoxynitrosobenzene (o-nitrosoanisole) {{is formed as a}} minor metabolite. Another N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine metabolite, the exact structure of which has not been identified as yet, was generated by hepatic microsomes of rabbits, but its formation by those of rats was negligible. To evaluate the role of rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P 450 (CYP) in N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine metabolism, we investigated the modulation of its metabolism by specific inducers of these enzymes. The results of this study show that rat hepatic CYPs of a 1 A subfamily and, to a lesser extent those of a 2 B subfamily, catalyze N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine conversion to form both its reductive metabolite, <b>o-anisidine,</b> and o-aminophenol.

40|$|An {{aromatic}} amine, <b>o-anisidine</b> (2 -methoxyaniline) and its oxidative counterpart, 2 -nitroanisole (2 -methoxynitrobenzene), are {{the industrial}} and environmental pollutants causing {{tumors of the}} urinary bladder in rats and mice. Both carcinogens are activated to the same proximate carcinogenic metabolite, N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine, which spontaneously decomposes to nitrenium and/or carbenium ions responsible for formation of deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA in vitro and in vivo. In other words, generation of N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine {{is responsible for the}} genotoxic mechanisms of the <b>o-anisidine</b> and 2 -nitroanisole carcinogenicity. Analogous enzymes of human and rat livers are capable of activating these carcinogens. Namely, human and rat cytochorme P 4502 E 1 is the major enzyme oxidizing <b>o-anisidine</b> to N-(2 -methoxyphenyl) hydroxylamine, while xanthine oxidase of both species reduces 2 -nitroanisole to this metabolite. Likewise, O-demethylation of 2 -nitroanisole, which is the detoxication pathway of its metabolism, is also catalyzed by the same human and rat enzyme, cytochorme P 450 2 E 1.

A new high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and optimized, for the determination of eight banned aromatic amines: benzidine, <b>o-anisidine,</b> o-phenylenediamine, o-nitroaniline, 2 -methoxy- 5 -methylaniline (p-cresidine), o-toluidine, p-toluidine and p-chloroaniline. The chromatographic conditions used were: C 18 column, 0. 085 M SDS, 3. 2 % (v/v) pentanol mobile phase buffered at pH 7. 0, with detection at 280 nm. Under these conditions, the eight aromatic amines were separated and quantified in industrial waste waters in less than 16 min. Method validation studies were performed according to the ICH Guideline.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{analytic}} method for {{the determination of}} aromatic amines (aniline, <b>o-anisidine,</b> 4 -chloroaniline) has been investigated. This new method combines the hollow fiber protected liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) with on-line microwave assisted derivatization and concentration. In this work, HF-LPME is assembled as a microdialysis sampling tool to concentrate and exclude the analytes in water samples. After the extraction, the extraction solvent was mixed with derivatization agent (trifluoroacetic anhydride) and flow into microwave oven through the on-line hollow fiber membrane. Microwave energy is utilized to accelerate derivatization reaction and also to heat the silicon carbide which is present inside the microwave oven. Under the optimal microwave power, the extraction solvent is vaporized from the silicon carbide and reached to concentration valve {{and then it was}} taken to injection for GC-ECD analysis. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency are well optimized and the best extraction was achieved by using ethyl acetate as extraction solvent, inject rate of 0. 12 mL/min, sample temperature of 35 oC, stirring rate of 150 rpm, addition of 0. 125 % sodium chloride, microwave power at 158 Watts and extraction time for 25 mins. Under the selected conditions, good linearity was obtained in the range of aniline and <b>o-anisidine</b> was 1 - 50 μg/L, and for 4 -chloroaniline was 0. 002 - 0. 1 μg/L. The correlation coefficients were between 0. 9951 - 0. 9984. Enrichment factors were ranged 169 - 545. The limit of detection were 0. 2 μg/L for aniline, 0. 4 μg/L for <b>o-anisidine,</b> and 0. 001 μg/L for 4 -chloroaniline. In real sample analysis, aniline was detected at 1. 66 mg/L and 4 -chloroaniline 0. 006 mg/L in industrial waste water. The recovery of three aromatic amines was between 80 - 99 % and RSD was between 3. 5 - 10. 3 %. Aniline was detected at 3. 13 mg/kg in dress materials. The recovery of three aromatic amines was between 80 - 98 % and RSD was between 4. 6 - 8. 1 %. The proposed method provides a simple, sensitive, flexible, and eco-friendly procedure to enrich and determine aromatic amines in aqueous samples. 本研究開發以中空纖維微透析採樣連線微波輔助衍生化暨蒸發濃縮技術結合GC-ECD分析水樣中微量芳香胺類化合物。以水樣中的苯胺、甲氧苯胺、對氯苯胺為分析標的物，探討本技術之可行性。研究中使用針式幫浦將有機溶劑緩慢注入浸於水樣中的中空纖維管中進行微透析萃取採樣。中空纖維管後端連接PTFE管，並同時注入衍生化試劑，將含混合溶液管路導入微波爐腔中進行微波輔助衍生化反應後，再導入裝有碳化矽之樣品瓶中可承接有機溶劑的玻璃試管。藉著碳化矽之吸收微波能量而快速升溫，使有機溶劑汽化，達到衍生化分析物之濃縮，最後以GC-ECD分析檢測衍生化分析物。實驗裝置及影響本方法成效之因素被加以詳盡探討。研究結果顯示，以乙酸乙酯為萃取液，進樣流速 0. 12 mL/min、萃取水樣溫度 35 度，水樣pH 12. 4 ，攪拌子速率 150 rpm，添加氯化鈉比例 0. 125 %，於微波功率 158 Watts條件，進行 25 分下可得到最佳萃取採樣暨衍生化反應效果。經此方法進行水樣中微量芳香胺類化合物之萃取採樣分析，苯胺及鄰氧甲基苯胺之線性範圍在 1 - 50 ug/L、對氯苯胺之線性範圍在 0. 002 - 0. 1 ug/L，其相關係數在 0. 9951 - 0. 9984 之間，濃縮倍率達 169 - 545 倍。偵測極限分別為 0. 2 ug/L(苯胺) 、 0. 4 ug/L(鄰氧甲基苯胺) 、 0. 001 ug/L(對氯苯胺) 。以此檢測技術應用工業廢水測定，偵測到含苯胺濃度 1. 66 mg/L，對氯苯胺 0. 006 mg/L，回收率 80 - 99 %，RSD介於 3. 5 - 10. 3 %，於市面衣料檢測，偵測到含有苯胺量 3. 13 mg/kg，回收率介於 80 - 98 %，RSD介於 4. 6 - 8. 1 %之間。目錄 摘要	i Abstract	ii 圖目錄	vi 表目錄	vii 第一章、研究動機	 1 (一) 芳香胺之概述	 1 (二) 芳香胺類相關偵檢方法介紹	 1 1. 固相萃取法(solid phase extraction) 	 3 2. 固相微萃取(solid phase microextraction) 	 4 3. 液相微萃取(liquid phase microextraction) 	 7 (三) 苯胺類分析物之衍生化反應	 11 (四) 微透析技術與微波輔助衍生化暨濃縮技術概述	 16 (1) 微透析技術之進展	 16 (2) 微透析之原理	 16 (3) 微波輔助衍生化	 17 (4) 微波輔助濃縮	 17 (五) 研究目的	 18 研究架構圖	 19 第二章 實驗器材及研究方法	 20 一、藥品、儀器設備及器材	 20 (一) 藥品	 20 (二) 儀器設備與器材	 20 二、藥品配製	 22 三、玻璃器皿的矽烷化	 24 四、實驗儀器與條件設定	 24 (一) 氣相層析儀等儀器設定	 24 (二) 儀器裝置圖	 25 (三) 微透析系統之建立	 28 五、中空纖維微透析萃取採樣聯線微波輔助衍生化反應暨蒸發濃縮技術定裝置之建立	 28 六、微波爐之功率測定	 29 七、實驗步驟	 30 八、實驗條件探討	 31 (一) 流析液之選擇	 31 (二) 微透析萃取流析液速率之探討	 31 (三) 萃取溫度之探討	 31 (四) 水樣pH值之探討	 32 (五) 鹽析效應之探討	 32 (六) 水樣樣品攪拌速率之探討	 32 (七) 微波功率之探討	 33 (八) 水溶液中分析物之線性濃度範圍、校正曲線、相關係數及偵測極限	 33 八、真實樣品的測定及回收率	 34 第三章 結果與討論	 35 一、萃取條件之最佳化	 35 (一) 流析液之最佳化	 35 (二) 流析液速率之探討	 38 (三) 萃取溫度之探討	 40 (四) 水樣pH值之探討	 42 (五) 鹽析效應之探討	 44 (六) 樣品攪拌速率之影響	 46 (七) 微波功率之探討	 48 二、方法可行性之評估	 50 (一) 校正曲線及相關係數	 50 (二) 真實樣品	 51 (三) 與現有方法之比較	 60 第四章 結論	 61 第五章 參考文獻	 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} PhD thesis was {{the development}} of a new in vitro test system which allows for a better characterization and prediction of drug-induced liver injuries (DILI). After the initial damage of hepatocytes, the activation of the immune system can aggravate this damage and lead to severe liver failure. This important interaction should be included in a co-culture system and thus lead to an improved prediction of DILI as well as reveal the underlying mechanisms. Therefore a liver cell line and an immune cell line with a macrophage-like phenotype were combined to develop an indirect co-culture system. In this system soluble signalling molecules can be exchanged and thus molecular events which have been described in vivo can be analyzed in detail. In the first part of this work, a co-culture model with HepG 2 cells as hepatic cell line and differentiated THP- 1 cells as immune cell line was established. For the validation of the model system, the metabolism of the antifungal drug ketoconazole was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Seven reactive metabolites were detected, including the highly toxic N-deacetyl ketoconazole. Afterwards changes in signalling pathways were investigated by proteome analyses via LC-MS/MS. They revealed the inhibition of the sterol synthesis and the activation of the CXCL 8 pathway and the Nrf 2 -mediated oxidative stress response in HepG 2 cells in vitro. These changes lead to an increase in cytokine expression and secretion which was validated in targeted PCR and ELISA analyses. The activation of the CXCL 8 signalling pathway could be verified by the detection of several proinflammatory cytokines including CXCL 8, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta. In addition, a concentration dependent increase of HMGB 1 protein could be detected in treated co-cultures which is an only recently described possible new biomarker. In the newly established co-culture model, the aromatic amine <b>o-anisidine</b> was tested regarding its mode of action. It was compared with its para-isomer p-anisidine and caffeine. The proteome analysis showed the activation of the eIF 2 signalling pathway and the Nrf 2 -mediated oxidative stress response. Targeted approaches revealed the concentration dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <b>o-anisidine</b> treated cell cultures. Strikingly the mitochondrial membrane became depolarized by <b>o-anisidine</b> treatment. This correlated with the observed ATP decrease. As no increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines could be shown in treated co-cultures, a liver injury through an immune-mediated mechanism seems unlikely. The increased release of HMGB 1 points towards its role as an early indicator of liver injury. In contrast to that neither p-anisidine nor caffeine induced the ROS generation. Caffeine did not change the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, either. Experiments using the Huh- 7 cell line as a possible alternative to HepG 2 showed already in single cultures the release of cytokines at high concentrations. This does not correlate with the described in vivo effects. Therefore the Huh- 7 cell line is not suitable for the approach taken here. These results show that the use of this in vitro co-culture systems can lead to an improved prediction of toxic substances. They take the interactions with the immune system into account. HMGB 1 seems to be a new, possible biomarker for damaged hepatocytes and thus an early indicator of a liver injury. The co-culture model established in this PhD thesis can lead to an early prediction of a drug’s hepatotoxicity and thus to a reduction of animal experiments...|$|E
