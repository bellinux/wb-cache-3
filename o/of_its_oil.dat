5|$|Nigeria {{was ranked}} 21st {{in the world}} in terms of GDP (PPP) in 2015. Nigeria is the United States' largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa and {{supplies}} a fifth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> (11% of oil imports). It has the seventh-largest trade surplus with the US of any country worldwide. Nigeria is the 50th-largest export market for US goods and the 14th-largest exporter of goods to the US. The United States is the country's largest foreign investor.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil embargo against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|The company sold $750 {{million in}} assets, {{including}} Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, {{in order to}} pay $1 billion in debt. Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000. In 1986 Fluor sold all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> assets and some of its gold mining operations. Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel. By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries. Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States. Fluor's international revenues rebounded. Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped {{down at the end of}} 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.|$|E

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

25|$|Western Europe began {{switching}} from pro-Israel to more pro-Arab policies. This change strained the Western alliance. The US, which imported only 12% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> from the Middle East (compared with 80% for the Europeans and over 90% for Japan), remained staunchly committed to Israel. The percentage of U.S.oil {{which comes from}} the nations bordering the Persian Gulf remained steady over the decades, with a figure of {{a little more than}} 10% in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the EU was {{importing}} 82% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> and 57% of its gas, {{which then}} {{made it the}} world's leading importer of these fuels. Only 3% of the uranium used in European nuclear reactors was mined in Europe. Russia, Canada, Australia, Niger and Kazakhstan were the five largest suppliers of nuclear materials to the EU, supplying more than 75% of the total needs in 2009. In 2015, the EU imports 53% of the energy it consumes.|$|E
25|$|Morton {{was born}} in Huddersfield, England, on 11 July 1924. He took a degree in geology at the Huddersfield Technical College and {{completed}} his studies at Leeds University, graduating {{in the summer of}} 1945. At this time, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) was looking to recruit geologists as part of recommencing <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> exploration operations in the Middle East. Morton applied for the post of assistant geologist and was appointed in the autumn of that year to take up his duties in Palestine and Transjordan.|$|E

25|$|After the Six-Day War, Iran {{supplied}} Israel with {{a significant}} portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> needs and Iranian oil was shipped to European markets via the joint Israeli-Iranian Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline. Brisk trade between the countries continued until 1979, with Israeli construction firms and engineers active in Iran. El Al, the Israeli national airline, operated direct flights between Tel Aviv and Tehran. Iranian-Israeli military links and projects were kept secret, but they {{are believed to have}} been wide-ranging, for example the joint military project Project Flower (1977–79), an Iranian-Israeli attempt to develop a new missile.|$|E
25|$|Well before 1976, Venezuela {{had taken}} several {{steps in the}} {{direction}} of nationalization <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> industry. In August 1971, under the presidency of Rafael Caldera, a law was passed that nationalized the country's natural gas industry. Also in 1971 the law of reversion was passed which stated that all the assets, plant, and equipment belonging to concessionaires within or outside the concession areas would revert to the nation without compensation upon the expiration of the concession. The movement towards nationalism was experienced once again under decree 832. Decree 832 stipulated that all exploration, production, refining, and sales programs of the oil companies had to be approved in advance by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|China's onshore oil {{resources}} are mostly {{located in the}} Northeast and in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Oil shale is found {{in a number of}} places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality light oil has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The country consumes most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> output but does export some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{skilled worker}} {{shortage}} {{was much more}} severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> heavy <b>oil</b> experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> elite heavy <b>oil</b> technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|R

25|$|Commercial {{production}} {{began in}} 1967 when Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) launched the world's first major oil sands mine. Syncrude opened {{the second major}} facility in 1978. The third, by Shell Canada, started in 2003. The oil price increases of 2004-2007 made the oil sands much more profitable, and by 2007 over $100 billion worth of new mines and thermal projects were under construction or on the drawing boards. Royal Dutch Shell announced that in 2006 its Canadian oil sands operations were almost twice as profitable on a per-barrel basis as its international conventional oil operations and in July 2007, it announced it would start a massive $27 billion expansion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> sands plants in Alberta.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Canada was {{importing}} 90% <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> {{from the}} U.S. The situation changed dramatically in 1947 when, after drilling 133 consecutive dry holes, Imperial Oil decided to drill into a peculiar anomaly on its newly developed seismic recordings near the then-village of Leduc {{to see what it}} was. The Leduc No. 1 well identified a large oil field, and provided the geological key for other important discoveries within Alberta. Geologists soon began to identify and drill other Devonian reefs within the province - mostly in the north-central portion of the province. The Alberta oil rush began, and drillers quickly began to identify other important oil-bearing formations like the one hosting the giant Pembina oilfield.|$|E
25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E

25|$|Since 1993, China {{has been}} a net {{importer}} of oil, {{a large portion of}} which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5millionbarrels (560,000m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields. Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{volatility}} of these transit routes {{is likely to}} shape investment decisions of international oil companies involved {{in the development of}} Central Asian and Caspian hydrocarbons and their transportation to global markets. Governments of these resource rich countries are bound to have serious concerns about the safety of BTC, WREP and BTE pipelines, the railway networks and the oil terminals at the Georgian Black Sea ports of Batumi, Kulevi and Poti, all of which were halted by the Georgian-Russian hostilities. Although, the pipelines were only temporarily shut down for security reasons and were not targeted or damaged in the conflict, their future expansion and the construction of related new pipeline projects, such as the Kazakh-Caspian Transportation System, the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline and Nabucco are now uncertain. In this situation, Central Asian and Caspian producers may opt for traditional exports via Russia (providing Moscow successfully expands the capacity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> and gas export routes) and the new export pipelines to China.|$|E
25|$|Access to oil {{was one of}} the linchpins of the Japanese war effort, as Japan has no native {{source of}} oil; it could not even produce enough to meet even 10% of its needs, even with the {{extraction}} of oil shale in Manchuria using the Fushun process. Japan quickly lost 93 percent <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>oil</b> supply after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order on 26 July 1941 which froze all of Japan's U.S. assets and embargoed all oil exports to Japan. In addition, the Dutch government in exile, at the urging of the Allies and with the support of Queen Wilhelmina, broke its economic treaty with Japan and joined the embargo in August. Japan's military and economic reserves included only a year and a half's worth of oil. As a U.S. declaration of war against Japan was feared if the latter took the East Indies, the Japanese planned to eliminate the U.S. Pacific Fleet, allowing them to overtake the islands; this led to the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1945, {{concern for}} American control <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{offshore}} <b>oil</b> reserves caused President Harry Truman {{to issue an}} Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge <b>of</b> <b>its</b> continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit [...] "freedom of the seas" [...] regime.|$|R
