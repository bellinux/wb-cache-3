25|$|Unfortunately, the {{presence}} of a group can influence one’s perception of these two factors in a number of ways. For instance, working in a group may reduce or increase one’s expectancy of attaining a goal. That is, depending on the qualities of the group members, an individual may find themselves in a group of high achievers who work hard and are guaranteed success, whereas another may equally find themselves in a group of lazy or distracted people, making success seem unattainable. Therefore, the link between one’s personal efforts and success is not direct, as <b>our</b> <b>success</b> is influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the value of the goal may be contingent on the group members. For instance, if we must share the reaping of success with all other group members, then the value of the goal is reduced compared to the value of the goal from an individual perspective. Hence, the dynamic of the group is an important key in determining a person’s motivation and the likelihood of social loafing. Additional factors which have been found to influence the likelihood of social loafing include one’s gender, one’s cultural background and the complexity of the task.|$|E

500|$|In 1992 Megadeth {{released}} Countdown to Extinction, {{which contained}} songs with compact, accessible structures that resulted with strong sales and significant radio airplay. 1994's Youthanasia and 1997's Cryptic Writings followed a similar route, receiving platinum and gold certification respectively, {{with the latter}} spawning three rock-radio hits. Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I {{think a lot of}} <b>our</b> <b>success</b> now {{has to do with the}} fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't get the opportunity to go into the market with educated strategy. Fortunately, for us, our management educated us on how to study what's current without losing our integrity and to keep on edge while staying at the forefront of what's important right now." ...|$|E
500|$|As Grant moved south against Lee in the Overland Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler {{launched}} the surprise Bermuda Hundred Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond {{to the aid}} of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of {{the right wing of the}} Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, [...] "I am willing to do anything for <b>our</b> <b>success,</b> but cannot leave my Department without orders of War Department." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured <b>our</b> <b>success</b> in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 25, light skirmishing {{occurred}} {{between the lines}} and Union soldiers occupied themselves by tearing up 5 miles of the Virginia Central Railroad, a key supply line from the Shenandoah Valley to Richmond. Grant's options were limited. The slaughter at Spotsylvania Court House ruled out the option of frontal attacks against the Confederate line and getting around either Confederate flank was infeasible. However, the Union general remained optimistic. He was convinced that Lee had demonstrated the weakness of his army by not attacking {{when he had the}} upper hand. He wrote to the Army's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck: [...] "Lee's army is really whipped. ...

2500|$|Grant {{almost fell}} into Lee's trap. He {{assaulted}} {{the tip of}} the apex at Ox Ford and {{the right wing of the}} V, but Lee, who was incapacitated in his tent by diarrhea, could not coordinate the attack he planned to make, losing a golden opportunity. Grant finally realized the situation he faced with a divided army and ordered his men to stop advancing and to build earthworks of their own. However, the Union general remained optimistic. He was convinced that Lee had demonstrated the weakness of his army by not attacking when he had the upper hand. He wrote to the Army's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Henry W.

2500|$|Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is {{time for}} Democrats who {{distrust}} President Bush to acknowledge {{that he will be}} Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nation’s peril. It {{is time for}} Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in the war in Iraq is critical to rebuilding the support of the American people that is essential to <b>our</b> <b>success</b> in that war. It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism.

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} began recording with producer Brendan O'Brien, who {{had previously}} worked with the band on Light Grenades (2006) and A Crow Left of the Murder... (2004). Recording took place at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Henson Studios in Los Angeles and Casa Chica in Malibu. Vocalist Brandon Boyd discussed the decision to work with O'Brien once again, stating, [...] "We {{grew up listening to}} his records. We quickly became friends and that's been a catalyst for <b>our</b> <b>success</b> with him. He understands that we like to work quickly." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "I love Brendan and I consider him like a family member. Over the years he’s been like a musical confidante and he’s been very loyal and very helpful. He’s gotten involved in other stuff that he didn’t have to get involved with outside of the band." [...] Pasillas noted, [...] "He’s kind of like a sixth member." [...] Einziger recorded the majority of his guitar parts in his house.|$|E
2500|$|Discrimination on {{the basis}} of race or {{ethnicity}} was legally sanctioned until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: [...] "to build on <b>our</b> <b>success</b> as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future". The White Australia Policy continues to be mentioned in modern contexts, although it is generally only mentioned by politicians when denouncing their opposition. As Leader of the Opposition, John Howard argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988 as part of his One Australia policy; in August 1988, he said: I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it [...] were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks, and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The Howard Government (1996–2007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005–06, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). In 2005–06, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996–97). This figure included around 17,000 through the humanitarian programme, of whom Iraqis and Sudanese accounted for the largest portions. China became Australia's biggest source of migrants, for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain.|$|E

It's usually not an easy question for a public health professional to answer. A medical practitioner can explain how they helped individuals with their health issues, patient by patient.
