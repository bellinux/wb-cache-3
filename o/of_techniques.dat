40|$|We {{assess the}} current state of {{workplace}} spirituality from the philosophical perspective of Jacques Ellul and show how the workplace spirituality movement has not escaped the infiltration and pervasiveness <b>of</b> <b>technique.</b> First, we describe Ellul’s notion <b>of</b> <b>technique,</b> that the technical processes created to serve a limited form of economic rationality predominate western thinking, and his critique that technique has become dominant, becoming an end in itself and subsuming all other ends as means in support <b>of</b> <b>technique.</b> We then demonstrate how the workplace spirituality movement presently displays the hallmarks <b>of</b> <b>technique</b> in its quest for results and facts, in its use of experts, and in the broadening and hence dissolution of the notion of spirituality. However, the dominance <b>of</b> <b>technique</b> has not gone unnoticed in the workplace spirituality movement. We highlight several scholars who have raised concerns and critiques of the movement in its technical form. Having noted the predominance <b>of</b> <b>technique</b> as well as its critique from some quarters, we suggest some possibilities for moving toward an authentic spirituality at work followed by some implications for undertaking scholarly research on workplace spirituality that explicitly recognizes technical dominance in spirituality.

5|$|The family uses {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>techniques</b> to obtain prey. The {{majority}} of antbirds are arboreal, {{with most of}} those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show a number <b>of</b> <b>techniques</b> and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and pause for shorter times.|$|E
