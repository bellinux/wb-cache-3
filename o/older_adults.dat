5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E

25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
40|$|The {{nervous system}} {{controls}} muscle force by modulating motor unit activity, which {{depends on the}} integration of synaptic input by the motor neurons. Due to significant remodeling of synaptic inputs and intrinsic properties of motor neurons with advancing age, synaptic integration presumably differs between young and <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> and thereby influences the modulation of discharge rate. The purpose of this dissertation research {{was to examine the}} consequences of aging on motor unit discharge characteristics. The first project examined age-related differences in the amount of discharge variability in a hand muscle during index finger abduction tasks. The purpose was to examine the influence of motor unit discharge variability on the force fluctuations in a hand muscle of <b>old</b> <b>adults.</b> The results provided evidence that discharge variability, which was similar for young and <b>old</b> <b>adults,</b> had a significant influence on force fluctuations and that the extent of discharge rate modulation was reduced in <b>old</b> <b>adults.</b> The purpose of the second study was to determine how long motor unit activity could be sustained during a voluntary contraction in humans. The study examined changes in mean motor unit discharge rate and discharge variability for the duration that young and <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> were able to keep a motor unit discharging action potentials. Despite the absence of change in discharge rate for young adults, discharge variability exhibited a marked increase. The duration of motor unit activity in <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> was briefer, yet discharge variability increased to a similar extent as for young adults. The purpose of the third project was to compare the discharge characteristics of motor units recruited during an isometric contraction that was sustained with the elbow flexor muscles by <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> at target forces that were less than the recruitment threshold force of each isolated motor unit. In contrast to motor units in young adults that discharged action potentials either repetitively or intermittently depending on the magnitude of the target-force difference, the motor units of <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> discharged action potentials repetitively regardless of the target-force difference. These results indicate that the rate modulation capabilities of the motor unit pool for biceps brachii are reduced in <b>old</b> <b>adults.</b> The purpose of the fourth study was to compare the discharge characteristics of motor units when recruited during contractions that required young and <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> to maintain a constant elbow angle while supporting a compliant load that was less than the recruitment threshold force of each isolated motor unit. The results indicated that the discharge of motor units in <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> was not modulated by an increase in load compliance, whereas it was in young adults. These findings demonstrate that <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> have a reduced ability to modulate motor unit discharge rate, which must contribute to the decline in motor system performance with advancing age...|$|R
50|$|In an experiment, for a single-task walking, 24% of <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> have gait speed <0.8 m/s {{but for a}} dual-task {{of walking}} and talking, 62% of <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> have gait speed <0.8 m/s. In {{practical}} terms, this means that {{a large proportion of}} healthy community-dwelling <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> may not walk fast enough to safely cross the street while simultaneously having a conversation. These findings support the assertion that generating spontaneous speech is highly demanding on cognitive resources and suggest that real world dual-task effects on gait may be underestimated by reaction time tasks.|$|R

As a result, the American Geriatrics Society recommends for an <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> with no known risk factors less than one drink a day or fewer than two drinks per occasion regardless of gender, this is less than current recommendations of maximum alcohol consumption per week, for adults noted to be nine drinks for a male and seven for a female.|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} {{decline in}} motor neuron number after ∼ 60 yr of age {{is accompanied by}} a remodeling of the neuromuscular system so that average motor unit force increases and the ability of <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> to produce an intended force declines. One possible explanation for the loss of movement precision is that the remodeling increases the difference in recruitment forces between successively recruited motor units in <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> and this augments force variability at motor unit recruitment. The {{purpose of the study was}} to compare the forces and discharge characteristics of motor units in a hand muscle of young and <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> at motor unit recruitment and derecruitment. The difference in recruitment force between pairs of motor units did not differ between young (n = 54) and <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> (n = 56; P = 0. 702). However, <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> had a greater proportion of contractions in which motor units discharged action potentials transiently before discharging continuously during the ramp increase in force (young: 0. 32; old: 0. 41; P = 0. 045). Force variability at motor unit recruitment was greater for <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> compared with young adults (P ≤ 0. 010), but discharge rate and discharge variability did not differ between age groups (P ≥ 0. 729). These results suggest that the difference in force between the recruitment of successive motor units does not differ between age groups, but that motor unit recruitment may be more transient and could contribute to the greater variability in force observed in <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> during graded ramp contractions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the contribution of}} supraspinal fatigue to muscle fatigue in <b>old</b> and young <b>adults.</b> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex {{was used to assess}} voluntary activation during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of elbow flexor muscles in 17 young adults (25. 5 ± 3. 6 yr; mean ± SD) and 7 <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> (73. 0 ± 3. 3 yr). Subjects performed a fatigue task involving six sustained MVCs (22 -s duration, separated by 10 s). Young adults exhibited greater reductions in maximal voluntary torque (67 ± 15 % of baseline) than the old (37 ± 6 %; P < 0. 001). Increments in torque (superimposed twitch) generated by TMS during sustained MVCs increased for the young and old (P < 0. 001) but were larger for the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> {{at the start of the}} sustained contractions and during recovery (P < 0. 05). Voluntary activation was less for the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> at the start of some sustained contractions and during recovery (P = 0. 02). Motor-evoked potential area increased similarly with age during the fatiguing task but was greater for the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> than young during recovery. Silent period duration lengthened less for the <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> during the fatigue task. At the end of the fatiguing task, peak relaxation rate of muscle fibers had declined more in the young than the <b>old</b> <b>adults.</b> The greater endurance with age is largely due to a difference in mechanisms located within the muscle. However, recovery from the fatiguing exercise is impaired for <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> because of greater supraspinal fatigue than in the young. Sandra K. Hunter, Gabrielle Todd, Jane E.

25|$|If <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> {{have fewer}} attentional {{resources}} than younger adults, {{we would expect}} that when two tasks {{must be carried out}} at the same time, older adults' performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. While some studies have found that <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli {{for an extended period of}} time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life. More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> think of it as demeaning. <b>Older</b> <b>adults</b> in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
