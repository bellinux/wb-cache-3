25|$|It premiered in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 24, 2013, and was {{released}} in the United States on January 25. Reviews were generally mixed, with many critics feeling {{that it was a}} poor adaptation of the book, and typical of Statham's sub-par action films <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Others found Statham well-fitted for the role of Parker and praised Lopez for providing comedic relief. It grossed $46 million worldwide at the box office.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{expanding}} Siegfried's Tod {{into a series}} of two or more operas would have been particularly appealing to Wagner, as he had now come to realize that {{it would be impossible to}} say all that he wanted to in a single opera without an inordinate number of digressions. The political events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> and his recent discovery of the philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach had greatly enlarged the scope of ideas which he hoped to explore in his new opera. He also wished to incorporate various ideas that he had been mulling over in the works on Jesus, Frederick, Achilles and Wieland (all four of which had been effectively abandoned by now). These ideas ranged over the politics of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin and the philosophy of Hegel and the Young Hegelians.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} significantly darker themes {{than any}} of Disturbed's previous work, according to the band. Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist David Draiman had endured over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> prior to making the album, including [...] "bad relationships", a motorcycle accident {{that he was involved}} with, and an incident of suicide. To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music than they have before. Despite these themes, the title track, [...] "Indestructible", is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their morale.|$|E

500|$|Kruger {{considered}} Providence his {{guide in}} life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the Earth was flat, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said grace twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become Afrikaans. In late 1858, {{when he returned to}} Waterkloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> {{and in the midst of}} a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him [...] "nearly dead from hunger and thirst", Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child.|$|E
500|$|At the {{entrance}} to Ashera's chambers, the group encounters Sanaki's trusted adviser Sephiran, who bars the way to Ashera. Sephiran is revealed to be Lehran, a heron laguz of legend who in ages past aided Ashera in defeating Yune and sealed her within the Fire Emblem medallion. Lehran lost his powers when he mated with the first Empress of Begnion, but was through this act able to pass on his galdr and gift of clairvoyance to the females of his bloodline, the empresses of Begnion. Lehran freely admits during the ensuing confrontation {{that he was the}} cause of most of the major events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> He inspired the Mad King Ashnard of Daein to start a war, encouraged conflict between Begnion and the Laguz Alliance, and allowed the atrocities of the Daein Liberation War to take place in an attempt to cause {{the end of the world}} by creating enough chaos to release the dark god. He did not foresee, however, the lengths to which heroes would go to save Tellius. Defeated in the ensuing battle, Lehran agrees to assist the champions in defeating Ashera if he is spared. In the final chamber, Yune pleads with Ashera to allow the world to go on. Ashera refuses, however, and engages the champions in battle. Ashera proves unable to be killed by mortal weapons, so Micaiah and Yune channel their collective energies into Ike's sword, allowing him to kill Ashera. After a tearful goodbye with Ike and Micaiah, Yune departs from the mortal world.|$|E
2500|$|After all of {{the turmoil}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> Alice Paul {{announced}} a radical new plan for 1916—she wanted to organize a woman’s political party. [...] Burns adamantly supported this plan and on June 5, 6, and 7, 1916 at the Blackstone Theater in Chicago, delegates and female voters met to organize the National Woman's Party (NWP). Burns and Paul were committed to direct action in fighting for women's rights and particularly their right to vote. [...] They were opposed by more conservative suffragists who advocated less militant tactics. [...] NAWSA leaders thought the tactics of the National Woman’s Party were futile and would alienate Democrats that were sympathetic to suffrage. [...] Membership in the NWP was limited to only enfranchised women, and their sole goal was promoting a federal amendment for woman’s suffrage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evaluation}} {{concludes with}} the auditor determining, {{based on the}} evaluation, whether the recipient is a high-risk auditee or a low-risk auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has {{a high risk of}} not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. For example, an auditor may judge a recipient to be a high-risk auditee because the audit reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> have numerous audit findings (e.g. specific situations of non-compliance with laws and regulations, serious deficiencies in internal controls and/or acts of fraud), or because the auditor receives news from various sources that the recipient is engaged in illegal activities, such as money laundering. On the other hand, the auditor may determine that a recipient is low-risk because its management personnel have a good work ethic, the auditor has received good references from external sources, or because the recipient has never received any audit findings. However, the OMB Circular A-133 has set certain requirements a recipient must meet to be considered a low-risk recipient. This includes the following: ...|$|E

After all the years he had disapproved of Austen's deeds it seemed strange indeed to be called to account by the prodigal for his own. Could it be that this boy whom he had so often chastised took a clearer view of practical morality than himself? It was preposterous. But why the uneasiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years?</b> Why had he more than once during that period, {{for the first time}} in his life, questioned a hitherto absolute satisfaction in his position of chief counsel for the Northeastern Railroads? Why had he hesitated to initiate his son into many of the so-called duties of a railroad lawyer? Austen had never verbally arraigned those duties until to-night.|$|E
60|$|That Martin-Roget was her enemy--aye and her father's too--she had {{absolutely}} no doubt. Some obscure yet keen instinct was working in her heart, urging her to mistrust him even more wholly than she had done before. Just now, when he laid ruthless hands on her and carried her, inert and half-swooning, back into the coach, and she lay with closed eyes, her very soul in revolt against this contact with him, against the feel of his arms around her, a vague memory surcharged with horror and with dread stirred within her brain: and over the vista <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> she looked back upon an evening in the autumn--a rough night with the wind from the Atlantic blowing across the lowlands of Poitou and soughing in the willow trees that bordered the Loire--she seemed to hear the tumultuous cries of enraged human creatures dominating {{the sound of the}} gale, she felt the crowd of evil-intentioned men around the closed carriage wherein she sat, calm and unafraid. Darkness then was all around her. She could not see. She could only hear and feel. And she heard the carriage door being wrenched open, and she felt the cold breath of the wind upon her cheek, and also the hot breath of a man in a passion of fury and of hate.|$|E

6000|$|The scandals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> have at last {{moved the}} {{yachting}} world to concerted action {{in regard to}} [...] "bat" [...] boat racing. We have been treated to the spectacle of what are practically keeled racing-planes driven a clear five foot or more above the water, and only eased down to touch their so-called [...] "native element" [...] as they near the line. Judges and starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity, but the public demonstration off St. Catherine's Light at the Autumn Regattas has borne ample, if tardy, fruit. In the future the [...] "bat" [...] {{is to be a}} boat, and the long-unheeded demand of the true sportsman for [...] "no daylight under mid-keel in smooth water" [...] is in a fair way to be conceded. The new rule severely restricts plane area and lift alike. The gas compartments are permitted both fore and aft, as in the old type, but the water-ballast central tank is rendered obligatory. These things work, if not for perfection, at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome waterborne cruiser. The type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules, so we may expect to see the Long-Davidson make (the patent on which has just expired) come largely into use henceforward, though the strain on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is admittedly very severe. But bat-boat racing has a great future before it.|$|E
