5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis.

The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web.

Later that day, no convection remained around the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression. The JTWC issued their final advisory on February12 as the storm showed no signs of convective activity. Hondo degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area as Météo-France issued their final advisory at 1200UTC. For the next week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwestward direction with little or no development. On February20, about 2,780km (1,725mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the low began to develop weak convection around the northern edge of the center of circulation.|$|E

This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
