5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E

And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluator}} is {{instructed to}} assess {{the extent to which}} the patient displays the given criterion. Each item is scored independently based on a five-point, ratio scale. A rating of 0 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> is not present in the patient. A rating of 1 indicates mild prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 2 indicates moderate prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 3 indicates severe prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 4 indicates a very severe prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> existential explication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> "saṁsāra" by Yoshinori Takeuchi, {{compared with}} the one by Keiji Nishitani.

He failed to show any examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> which one has before conversion or enlightenment. I try to consider where <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> originates before conversion or enlightenment. I think it originates from the shudder that one has when one acknowledges that the birth-and-death problem (one has to transcend both birth and death and never be born and die any more) will never vanish even if one is dead. If one cannot settle this problem during this lifetime, {{and as long as}} it never disappears when one dies, then one must carry it over into one's next life after death. This is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> "saṁsāra"...|$|R

25|$|Typical {{deficiencies}} {{may include}} problems identifying, processing, describing, {{and working with}} one's own feelings, often marked {{by a lack of}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.|$|E

Undergraduates learned a list in which various items were acquired to a criterion of either one correct recall, two correct recalls, or four correct recalls.

Measurement tool was a researcher-made questionnaire whose construct validity was established through factor analysis and its reliability {{was measured using}} cronbach alpha coefficient. Descriptive findings showed that both rates of feeling insecurity is and disorder are high among Yasouj residents.

[...] This leads to his mentioning the then-current practice of substituting, on stage, a happy ending for Shakespeare's tragic one, which had been approved by no less an authority than Dr. Johnson. Arguing against this practice, Hazlitt brings in a lengthy quote from an article Lamb wrote for Leigh Hunt's Reflector, which concludes: [...] "A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings alive, did not make a fair dismissal from life the only decorous thing for him." ...|$|E

Scriptwriter Helen MacWhirter also stated that Lana's story is [...] "multi-faceted", saying, [...] "On one level it's about a young girl {{coming to terms with}} her sexuality, which on its own might have been a bit boring and gratuitous, but it also brought into play other story strands which added depth and dimension." ...|$|E

500|$|Within the poem, {{the narrator}} expresses his hope that his child, Hartley Coleridge, will {{experience}} a life connected to nature {{as represented by}} features typical of the Lake District, which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered. This is similar to what Coleridge's friend William Wordsworth does with the narrator of Tintern Abbey, a poem composed later that year. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of the narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge's sonnet [...] "To a Friend Who Asked, How I Felt When the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me". The ideas about nature in This Lime-Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education, and Hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. Coleridge's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence.

[...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in [...] And a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E
