50|$|In the 1990s Merrow {{developed}} a new <b>overlock</b> <b>machine</b> called the Delta Class, but {{was never able to}} gain traction with the new model.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the early}} 20th Century, {{the areas of}} Connecticut, USA and New York, USA were the centers of textile {{manufacturing}} and machine production. Consequently many <b>overlock</b> <b>machine</b> companies established themselves in the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the <b>overlock</b> <b>machine,</b> patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|E
50|$|Of {{a typical}} garment factory's sewing machines, half might be {{lockstitch}} machines {{and the other}} half divided between <b>overlock</b> <b>machines,</b> chain stitch machines, and various other specialized machines.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock, {{also known}} as [...] "serging" [...] or [...] "serger stitch", can be formed with one to four threads, one or two needles, {{and one or two}} loopers. <b>Overlock</b> sewing <b>machines</b> are usually {{equipped}} with knives that trim or create the edge immediately in front of the stitch formation. Household and industrial <b>overlock</b> <b>machines</b> are commonly used for garment seams in knit or stretchy fabrics, for garment seams where the fabric is light enough that the seam {{does not need to be}} pressed open, and for protecting edges against raveling. Machines using two to four threads are most common, and frequently one machine can be configured for several varieties of <b>overlock</b> stitch. <b>Overlock</b> <b>machines</b> with five or more threads usually make both a chainstitch with one needle and one looper, and an overlock stitch with the remaining needles and loopers. This combination is known as a [...] "safety stitch". A similar machine used for stretch fabrics is called a mock safety.|$|R
5000|$|An {{overlock}} {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine</b> will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows <b>overlock</b> <b>machines</b> to create finished seams easily and quickly. An <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine</b> differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitches}} {{are classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. The most basic classification is by the number of threads used in the stitch. Industrial <b>overlock</b> <b>machines</b> are generally made in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 thread formations. Each of these formations has unique uses and benefits: ...|$|R
50|$|Differential feed is a {{variation}} of drop feed with two independent sets of dogs, one before and one after the needle. By changing their relative motions, these sets of dogs {{can be used to}} stretch or compress the material {{in the vicinity of the}} needle. This is extremely useful when sewing stretchy material, and <b>overlock</b> <b>machines</b> (heavily used for such materials) frequently have differential feed.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Merrow was {{the driving}} force behind Merrow {{developing}} new technology, growing the new business and transforming it from a regional supplier of crochet sewing machines, to the market leader manufacturing hundreds of models of industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machines.</b> Under his leadership the company achieved a place of prominence in the industrial machine field with sales world-wide, hundreds of patents and the industries first industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1877 the world's first {{crochet machine}} was invented and {{patented}} by Joseph M. Merrow, then-president {{of what had}} started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine.</b> The Merrow Machine Company {{went on to become}} one of the largest American Manufacturers of <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machines,</b> and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|In Hartford {{the company}} focused on {{building}} lines of industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machines</b> {{that were used}} to overedge fabric, add decorative edging and support the fabric processing trade by joining fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Sales for <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machines</b> {{were strong}} and Merrow grew to employ more than 500 people in Hartford Ct. The company also excelled {{developing}} international distribution and by 1905 had agents in 35 countries and printed manuals {{in at least}} 12 languages.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overlock</b> sewing <b>machines</b> usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to over 9000 rpm, {{and most}} are used in {{industry}} for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, {{as they can be}} used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction.|$|R
50|$|The Merrow Machines were {{constructed}} under his direction prior to 1876 with numerous patents granted. The machines were so useful that business was undertaken {{to introduce the}} equipment to other textile manufacturers. In 1887 the knitting mill was destroyed by fire and the company moved to Hartford and reorganized concentrating on the manufacture of <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machines.</b>|$|R
40|$|Truly {{wearable}} sensing {{poses challenges}} in many areas. To be successful, wearable sensors must preserve wearer comfort while providing accurate sensor data. Further, for widespread commercial production {{they must also}} be compatible with soft goods manufacturing. Here, we present a method of fabricating stretch sensors using common apparel sewing machinery. The response of sensors made using industrial coverstitch (two varieties) and <b>overlock</b> <b>machines</b> are compared, and the sensor response of a bottom-thread coverstitch is characterized in depth. Three conductive thread structures are compared in the bottom-thread coverstitch sensor. Results show a consistent and repeatable response for 4 - and 5 -ply threads, while 2 -ply thread displayed more noise and less repeatability. Finally, this sensor is applied in a spinal goniometry application in three garment structures, and sensor performance is compared to motion capture data. The fabrication approach is promising for wearable sensing applications due to its manufacturability and comfort. ...|$|R

50|$|The Merrow® Sewing Machine Company, {{best known}} for inventing the <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine</b> is a {{manufacturer}} of sewing machines. After the explosion of his gunpowder mill in 1837, in 1838 J.M. Merrow built a knitting mill on the same site. The company developed crocheting machines for its own use and by 1887 evolved to design, build and market sewing machines exclusively. During its early decades it was organized as a partnership under various names: established in 1838 as Joseph M. Merrow & Sons by J. Makens Merrow, then Pitkin, Merrow, & Co., renamed Merrow Manufacturing Co. in 1857, then Merrow and Millard in 1863, J.B. Merrow and Sons in 1870, and incorporated as The Merrow Manufacturing Company in 1893. Originally all of its manufacturing was done at facilities in Merrow, Connecticut and then in Hartford, Connecticut after 1894. The company is currently based in Fall River, Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|Sewing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes in the apparel industry for the production of high-quality garments. Although some research and improvements have been carried out in this area, the sewing process has remained almost unchanged throughout the years, staying largely dependent on the operator skills to set up sewing parameters and to handle the fabrics being sewn. Slight changes in sewing machine settings can influence the quality of seams, as well as sewing operation time. To avoid these empirical settings, reduce set-up times and improve machine performance, flexibility and sewing quality, an electromagnetic actuated presser foot, based on the use of a proportional force solenoid, was developed and implemented on an industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine.</b> The compression force and displacement waveforms from the presser foot bar will be studied in this paper, as well as the admiss ible displacement limits used to monitor (on- and offline) fabrics’ feeding efficiency. Following this analysis, a new research programme was established to enable a PC-based open- and closed-loop control of the presser foot system. This paper also highlights these recent developments, presenting and discussing, in detail, a PID closed-loop control strategy.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study of {{problems}} associated with fabric sewing, such as seam pucker and sewing damage, in commercial garment manufacture. Part 1 continues previous work by the author on seam pucker in structurally jammed fabrics; in particular {{it has been shown that}} initial Young's modulus of a fabric is a measure of the ability of the fabric to accommodate compressive forces during sewing. This result provides an additional means of predicting the tendency of a fabric to exhibit seam pucker. The static mechanism of seam pucker proposed previously, based upon the relative magnitudes of bending stiffness of thread and fabric, has been revised by establishing that sewing machine dynamics and pucker are closely related. It has been shown that presser foot bouncing in particular induces pucker and that the sewing thread needs to be positively controlled during stitch formation. These results were verified by simple experimental methods, suggesting that modifications to the sewing machine are needed. Such modifications are beyond the scope of this work. Following the earlier static mechanism of seam pucker, it has been shown that seam pucker in fabrics is reduced significantly when the bending stiffness and extensibility of the sewing thread is reduced. In addition seam pucker can be eliminated by improving fabric stiffness locally along the seam area, by incorporating a stiffening material in the seam; this is based upon the technique of pucker elimination found in the author's previous work. In this study this technique is implemented with considerable success in other types of seams and commercially available stiffening materials have been selected. Part 2 investigates sewing damage to fabrics due to sewing needle penetration. Preliminary studies suggested the need for a reliable testing facility. This was made by instrumenting an industrial <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine.</b> The instrumentation was based on measuring the force which is exerted by the sewing needle when penetrating the fabric. The testing facility consists of the sewing machine with a strain gauged sewing needle and plate, and a shaft encoder for stitch marking, which with proper signal amplification and conditioning could be fed to a transient recorder and osciloscope for signal capturing and plotting. Investigations with fabrics revealed that the magnitude of the peak force of each stitch cycle can be related to the degree of sewing damage in the fabric. Based on these results the most important variables in sewing damage were fabric softening and its effective application during finishing, and sewing needle size. Studies of sewing damage under dynamic conditions have shown that sewing damage is a frictional problem between yarns in the fabric and between yarns and the metal of the sewing needle, foot, plate and feed dog. The size of the needle plate of the sewing machine seems to affect the degree of damage and fabric "flagging" during sewing damage has been experienced. Finally in the latter section of this study a prototype routine sewing damage tester has been developed and each stage of its development is described. This tester is based on an instrumented <b>overlock</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> which is interfaced with an IBM PC for computerised data capture and analysis in real time. ...|$|R
