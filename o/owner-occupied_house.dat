40|$|Homeownership, as {{a storage}} for housing wealth, is {{believed}} to play an increasingly important role in terms of welfare provision. However, homeownership does not always act as a nest-egg, {{it can be a}} source of financial anxiety as well. In this paper we investigate how homeownership and housing wealth moderate the relationship between divorce and subjective wellbeing (life satisfaction, happiness, financial satisfaction). Using longitudinal data for Australia we find homeowners are more negatively affected by divorce than tenants, among others because the owned house becomes a financial burden after divorce. We further find gendered effects. When women move from an owned to a rented house, divorce has a smaller negative effect on happiness and financial satisfaction than when remaining in the owned home. For men however, housing wealth alleviates financial stress when the divorcees remain in an <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>house</b> after divorce...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{taxation}} of the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>house</b> – the “principal dwelling”– was {{a recurrent}} central {{issue in the}} political and economic debate in Italy especially in the last 15 years. It may be useful, therefore, to address this issue, by both examining the theoretical aspects and reviewing the Italian legislation since the general tax reform of the seventies – whose starting point for direct taxation was the year 1974 – with respect to the two tax bases {{that can be used in}} the taxation of owner-occupied dwellings, namely the imputed income and the asset value. This paper first analyzes the tax treatment of principal dwellings in Italy on both equity and efficiency grounds over the past forty years and compares it with the solutions adopted in other countries; second an empirical assessment of the evolution of the total tax burden on owner-occupied houses in Italy is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} two {{potential}} problems that often {{arise in the}} discussions of the feasibility of consumption tax reform: (1) the potential negative effect of a consumption tax reform {{on the value of}} <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing,</b> and (2) the tendency of such a reform to impose a one-time windfall loss on the owners of existing capital other than <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing.</b> The results suggest that the reform-induced one-time windfall tax on the owners of existing assets tends to be overstated in models that do not explicitly account for <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing.</b> The study also suggests that the potential decline in the value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> could be significant, approximately 10 percent of the total value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing,</b> immediately after reform. However, the value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> is likely to rebound during the transition, resulting in significant increases in the value of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> in the long run...|$|R

40|$|Subsidized loans {{may help}} {{increase}} home ownership in low income neighborhoods with positive social benefits, however {{there are risks}} and costs to the homeowners themselves. Home ownership increases incentives to maintain property and neighborhood, as well as decreasing the outflow of rents from low-income zones. These benefits, however are not costless to participants. With a mortgage comes {{the possibility of a}} default, the financial demands of maintenance, the reduction in alternate investment opportunities, an increased exposure to fluctuations in local economic conditions, and a drastic reduction in the liquidity of personal wealth. In this paper we examine the role of the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>house</b> in the asset allocation decision of a family living in an area characterized as a low income neighborhood. We find that the current subsidies are likely to be too low relative to the costs. In particular, the tax law makes home ownership relatively less attractive to low-income families. This may explain a lack of home-ownership and thus, mortgage lending in low-income neighborhoods. ...|$|E

To estimate the incidence of psychotic disorders using comparable methods across 17 catchment areas in 6 countries and to examine the variance between catchment areas by putative environmental risk factors. An international multisite incidence study (the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions) was conducted from May 1, 2010, to April 1, 2015, among 2774 individuals from England (2 catchment areas), France (3 catchment areas), Italy (3 catchment areas), the Netherlands (2 catchment areas), Spain (6 catchment areas), and Brazil (1 catchment area) with a first episode of nonorganic psychotic disorders (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD- 10] codes F 20 -F 33) confirmed by the Operational Criteria Checklist. Denominator populations were estimated using official national statistics. Age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status were treated as a priori confounders. Latitude, population density, percentage unemployment, owner-occupied housing, and single-person households were treated as catchment area-level exposures. Incidence of nonorganic psychotic disorders (ICD- 10 codes F 20 -F 33), nonaffective psychoses (ICD- 10 codes F 20 -F 29), and affective psychoses (ICD- 10 codes F 30 -F 33) confirmed by the Operational Criteria Checklist. A total of 2774 patients (1196 women and 1578 men; median age, 30. 5 years [interquartile range, 23. 0 - 41. 0 years]) with incident cases of psychotic disorders were identified during 12. 9 million person-years at risk (crude incidence, 21. 4 per 100   000 person-years; 95 % CI, 19. 4 - 23. 4 per 100   000 person-years). A total of 2183 patients (78. 7 %) had nonaffective psychotic disorders. After direct standardization for age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status, an 8 -fold variation {{was seen in the}} incidence of all psychotic disorders, from 6. 0 (95 % CI, 3. 5 - 8. 6) per 100   000 person-years in Santiago, Spain, to 46. 1 (95 % CI, 37. 3 - 55. 0) per 100   000 person-years in Paris, France. Rates were elevated in racial/ethnic minority groups (incidence rate ratio, 1. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 1. 7), were highest for men 18 to 24 years of age, and were lower in catchment areas with more owner-occupied homes (incidence rate ratio, 0. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 7 - 0. 8). Similar patterns were observed for nonaffective psychoses; a lower incidence of affective psychoses was associated with higher area-level unemployment (incidence rate ratio, 0. 3; 95 % CI, 0. 2 - 0. 5). This study confirmed marked heterogeneity in risk for psychotic disorders by person and place, including higher rates in younger men, racial/ethnic minorities, and areas characterized by a lower percentage of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>house...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{a number}} of Western countries, imputed rental income on <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> is not taxed. In some countries, tax {{treatment}} is even more/favourable, with mortgage interest payments and/or local property taxes being deductible against the owner-occupier's other income. These policies provide a tax subsidy to <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing.</b> The subsidy creates economic distortions; in particular, it encourages an inefficient allocation of productive resources, producing economic waste. In addition, it places an excess tax burden on capital employed in other activity, and on labour. The distortions created by the favourable tax treatment of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> suggest issues of theoretical and empirical interest. A generalized user cost of capital methodology permits straight-forward investigation of the subsidy to <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> in several Western countries. The distortions created by the subsidy are revealed by the development of, and empirical application of, a static three-sector general equilibrium model of tax incidence. The three sectors are <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing,</b> rented housing, and other industry. The economic distortions are of different degrees in different countries, but are invariably quantitatively significant. Western governments are apparently persuaded by the dubious social arguments for <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing.</b> They {{are unlikely to be}} attracted by the "first-best" tax policy which advocates an equal tax on capital in all uses. The three-sector general equilibrium model permits the derivation of second-best tax rates, which minimize economic waste subject to the requirement that <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> be subsidized relative to rented housing. The favourable tax treatment of <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>housing</b> has important dynamic implications. Removal of the subsidy would stimulate intermediate-run growth, assoc with improvements in resource allocation. In the context of long-run balanced growth it is pos to identify the (undiscounted) long-run utility maximizing subsidy to housing. These dynamic issues warrant further research...|$|R
