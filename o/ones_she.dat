5|$|Navajo rubbings {{are found}} in the satchel of a {{motorcyclist}} who crashed while attempting to cross the Canada–United States border. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is called into a meeting with Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) and a few unknown men. She is shown a copy of the rubbings and is asked whether she can identify them. After the meeting, Scully explains to John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) that the rubbings are similar to <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> found on a wrecked spacecraft three years prior. Meanwhile, the motorcyclist uses an alien artifact which begins to heal the wounds from his crash.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after giving}} birth to the younger children, Maria Theresa was confronted {{with the task of}} marrying off the elder <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> led the {{marriage}} negotiations along with the campaigns of her wars and the duties of state. She treated her children with affection but used them as pawns in dynastic games and sacrificed their happiness {{for the benefit of the}} state. A devoted but self-conscious mother, she wrote to all of her children at least once a week and believed herself entitled to exercise authority over her children regardless of their age and rank.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster <b>ones</b> <b>she</b> had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next morning}} Changing Woman climbed a hill. Looking in the {{distance}} she saw many monsters approaching {{from the south and}} from the west and from the north. She made four sacred hoops. The white <b>one</b> <b>she</b> threw to the east. The blue <b>one</b> <b>she</b> threw to the south. The yellow <b>one</b> <b>she</b> threw to the west. The black <b>one</b> <b>she</b> threw to the north. At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan. [...] "The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter," [...] she told her sons. We will be safe for one day. But tomorrow the power will be gone." [...] At night, the twins spoke softly to one another. [...] "The monsters are coming for us," [...] they said. [...] "We must leave so the others will be safe." [...] Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic <b>ones,</b> <b>she</b> wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed <b>Ones.</b> <b>She</b> eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the greater good. Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is {{shown to be a}} powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E

25|$|New York resumed her {{civilian}} {{service on the}} New York–Southampton run in January 1899. During her first post-war crossing, one of her engines broke down {{and she had to}} return to Southampton for repairs lasting three months. Three years later, New York was taken out of service for an extensive refit that included replacing her machinery with quadruple expansion engines. Her good looks were partly spoiled when her three raked funnels were replaced with two taller <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> resumed service on 14 April 1903.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, her grandfather, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, was on the throne and her father was Tsarevich. In 1855, when Maria Alexandrovna was {{seventeen}} months old, Nicholas I died and her father became the new Russian Emperor. The grand duchess grew up as the only girl with four older brothers and two younger <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> did not know her only sister, Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna of Russia, who had died before she was born. Maria Alexandrovna herself almost died from a throat disease at the age of seven.|$|E
25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important <b>ones,</b> <b>she</b> will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E

The movie ends with Guy in Gilda's ransacked apartment reading the last letter written by her to him.|$|E
25|$|Minfong Ho, in {{her four}} novels, {{presented}} to her readers realistic depictions of her native Southeast Asia. Despite being fictions, her stories were all {{set against the}} backdrop of real historical events that she herself had experienced or at least observed firsthand. Her optimistic central theme remains similar throughout all four books. So do the central figures, who are all young girls facing harsh realities of life unimaginable by their more fortunate contemporaries in developed countries. With her sensitivity for the emotional world of her characters, Ho showed her readers the humane side behind atrocities of the October 6 massacre of student protesters in Bangkok and the Khmer Rouge regime. Against poverty, sexual discrimination, oppression, war, loss of loved <b>ones,</b> <b>she</b> maintained that human spirit should prevail.|$|E
25|$|Once activated, the dodecahedron {{transports}} {{the group}} {{through a series}} of wormholes to a massive station {{near the center of the}} Milky Way. The station contains a surreal Earth-like beach where the five are split up. Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in Cygnus A to counter the effects of entropy. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and hints at the discovery of artificial messages in transcendental numbers like π. Ellie is reunited with the other four travellers who have also met simulations of their loved <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> captures video evidence of the encounter before the dodecahedron takes them back to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Marian Anderson {{was born}} on February 27, 1897, in Philadelphia, the {{daughter}} of John Berkley Anderson and the former Annie Delilah Rucker. Her father sold ice and coal at the Reading Terminal in downtown Philadelphia and eventually opened a small liquor business as well. Prior to her marriage, Anderson's mother had briefly attended the Virginia Seminary and College in Lynchburg and {{had worked as a}} schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and not white <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alice (later spelled Alyse) (1899–1965) and Ethel (1902–1990), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their late son, James Anderson DePreist was a noted conductor.|$|E
25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous <b>ones.</b> <b>She</b> is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than just an object, like everybody else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|E

According to the church, events of the late 18th century that included a sighting of Christ on the mountain Qullqipunku became part of myth, and the pilgrimage festival of the Lord of Quyllurit'i is still celebrated in the 21st century.|$|E
