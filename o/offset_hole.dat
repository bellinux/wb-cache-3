The planning of the numerical experiment was based on the orthogonal array OA(18, 7, 3, 2), which allows 18 simulation runs with 7 parameters at 3 levels each. The strength of 2 of the array allows also for two-factor interaction studies. The seven parameters chosen for this study are: penetrator <b>offset,</b> <b>hole</b> diameter, hole taper, vertical and horizontal velocity of the penetrator, angle of attack of the penetrator and target material. The analysis of the simulation results has been based on main effects plots and analysis of variance (ANOVA), and it has been performed using three metrics: the maximum values of the penetration depth, penetrator deceleration and plastic strain in the penetrator case. This screening study shows that target material has a major influence on penetration depth and penetrator deceleration, while penetrator offset has the strongest effect on the maximum plastic strain...|$|E
40|$|The {{transportation}} of solids by suspension can cause severe damage to pipelines and infrastructures if not handled correctly. An adequate system for monitoring multiphase flow {{can be used}} to get early indications of erosion and poor hole cleaning. The use of ultrasonic and acoustic sensors has been reviewed for the application of slurry monitoring and evaluation of hole cleaning. The theories of slurry flow in pipes are quite extensive and are mostly based on fluid mechanics. The various aspects of liquid-particle flow including flow patterns, pressure drop, particle transport and particles in suspensions have been studied. In order to characterize these flows, several non-intrusive methods such as ultrasonic, acoustic, sonar, nucleonic and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) shows good accuracy. State-of-art systems in each category with accuracies are collected for comparison. The working principle of each system is described with sufficient theory. Various studies within acoustic and ultrasound, including detection of oversized material, velocity measurements and attenuation measurements, are useful for characterization of complex flows. Wellbores are extended over longer distances with incline and horizontal sections to increase production and reduce the number of offshore platforms. To reach the pre-determined target in the reservoir, at a given depth and <b>offset,</b> <b>hole</b> cleaning must be considered. The outcome of poor hole cleaning in complex wells, will likely end up in sidetracking and abandoning, both costly operations. In the conventional vertical well, hole cleaning had no large impact compared to the more extensive wells. Hence the field of hole cleaning is now becoming more and more an important tool for hole improvement. A method is presented in this master’s thesis, where hole cleaning efficiency is obtained by measuring drill-cuttings. The system utilize image analysis tool for Particle-Size Distribution (PSD), Cuttings morphology-tool for cuttings morphology, Roman Spectroscopy for cuttings mineralogy and Cuttings flow meter for total weight cuttings.

40|$|Magnetostratigraphic {{studies of}} Paleogene sediments piston-cored on Maud Rise, Weddell Sea (ODP Sites 689 and 690), are a {{cornerstone}} of Southern Ocean Paleogene and Neogene chronostratigraphy. However, parts of previous magnetostratigraphic interpretations have been called into question, and recent reinvestigation of the upper Paleocene-middle Eocene portion of Site 690 suggested that the records might be contaminated by spurious magnetizations, which raises doubts about the reliability of these important records. We undertook a high-resolution magnetostratigraphic study of Eocene-Oligocene u-channel samples from ODP Holes 689 B, 689 D, 690 B, and 690 C {{in order to address}} these concerns. A pervasive overprint appears to be present below the middle Eocene, which compromises magnetobiostratigraphic interpretations for the upper Cretaceous and lower Paleogene. Nevertheless, our new results provide a robust record of geomagnetic field behavior from 38. 5 to 25 Ma and confirm the reliability of these sediments for calibration of biostratigraphic datum events during a crucial phase of earth history when major Antarctic ice sheets developed. Also, comparison of magnetozone thicknesses in multiple holes at the same site indicates that ~ 1. 2 - 1. 8 m of the stratigraphic record is missing at each core break, which corresponds to time breaks of 120 - 360 k. y. Lack of a continuous record within a single hole renders useless spectral analyses for investigating long geomagnetic and paleoclimatic time series. This observation reinforces the need for coring of multiple <b>offset</b> <b>holes</b> to obtain continuous paleoceanographic records.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of oceanic and climatic conditions the northeast Indian Ocean {{during the last}} 7 m. y. is revealed in the sediments from Site 758. We present detailed and continuous records of d 18 O and d 13 C from planktonic foraminifers, weight percent calcium carbonate, weight percent coarse fraction, magnetic susceptibility, and geomagnetic reversals. Sample spacing of the records ranges from 3 to 10 cm and is equivalent to an average time interval of 2000 to 6000 yr. Despite the fact that core recovery ranged between 100 % and 105 %, recovery gaps as large as 2. 7 m occurred at nearly every break between advanced hydraulic piston cores. Approximately 12 % of the late Neogene sequence was not recovered {{in each of the}} two holes drilled at Site 758. To circumvent the discontinuity introduced by the gaps, a composite depth section was constructed from multiple cores taken from <b>offset</b> <b>holes</b> at Site 758. The resulting composite depth section extends continuously from 0 to 116 mbsf, from the Holocene to the upper Miocene. A detailed chronostratigraphy is based on geomagnetic reversals which extend from the Brunhes Chron to Chron 6, and on d 18 O stages 1 through 105, which span from 0 to 2. 5 Ma. The d 18 O record is dominated by a ~ 40 -k. y. cycle in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, and is followed by a change to a ~ 100 -k. y. cycle in the late Pleistocene. The mid-Pleistocene transition between these two modes of variability occurs between d 18 O stages 25 and 22 (between 860 and 800 Ka). Thirteen major volcanic ash horizons from the Indonesian arc are observed throughout the sedimentary section and are dated by their relative position within the geomagnetic reversals and the d 18 O chronostratigraphy. Since 5 Ma, there has been a long-term decline in weight percent CaCO 3 and CaCO 3 mass accumulation rates, and an associated rise in non-CaCO 3 mass accumulation rates. We attribute these changes to a decrease in CaCO 3 productivity and an increase in terrigenous sedimentation through enhanced riverine input. Such input may be linked to rapid tectonic uplift of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau via mechanisms such as the intensification of the monsoonal rains, increased fluvial erosion, and regional glaciation. The long-term increase in percent coarse fraction since 5 Ma suggests a gradual increase in CaCO 3 preservation. Higher frequency fluctuations in CaCO 3 preservation are superimposed on the long-term trend and are related to climate fluctuations. The abrupt drop (- 50 %) in CaCO 3 accumulation at 3. 4 Ma signals a dramatic decrease in CaCO 3 production that occurred over much of the Indian Ocean...|$|R

40|$|An {{automatic}} and efficient method to determine appropriate hole cuts based on distances {{to the wall}} and donor stencil maps for overset grids is presented. A new robust procedure is developed to create a closed surface triangulation representation of each geometric component for accurate determination of the minimum hole. Hole boundaries are then displaced away from the tight grid-spacing regions near solid walls to allow grid overlap to occur away from the walls where cell sizes from neighboring grids are more comparable. The placement of hole boundaries is efficiently determined using a mid-distance rule and Cartesian maps of potential valid donor stencils with minimal user input.

A numerical validation analysis was used to consolidate the procedure and evaluate the residual error after implementing the correction. The values of this error resulted limited to a few percentage points, even for eccentricities larger than the usual experimental values. The narrow eccentricity limit claimed by the standard, to keep the maximum error lower than 10 %, can now be considered extended by approximately a factor of 10, after implementing the proposed correcting procedure, proving that the effect of the eccentricity is mainly linear within a relatively large range...|$|R
2500|$|Sax's {{original}} keywork, {{which was}} based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made playing some legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger, so numerous developers added extra keys and alternate fingerings to make chromatic playing less difficult. While early saxophones had two separate octave vents to assist in the playing of the upper registers just as modern instruments do, players of Sax's original design had to operate these via two separate octave keys operated by the left thumb. A substantial advancement in saxophone keywork was the development of a method by which the left thumb operates both tone holes with a single octave key, which is now universal on modern saxophones. [...] Further developments were made by Selmer in the 1930s and '40s, including <b>offsetting</b> tone <b>holes</b> and a revamping of the octave key mechanism, beginning with balanced action instruments and continuing through their celebrated Mark VI line. One of the most radical, however temporary, revisions of saxophone keywork was made in the 1950s by M. Houvenaghel of Paris, who completely redeveloped the mechanics of the system to allow a number of notes (C, B, A, G, F and E) to be flattened by a semitone simply by pressing the right middle finger. This enables a chromatic scale to be played over two octaves simply by playing the diatonic scale combined with alternately raising and lowering this one digit.

A two-dimensional, finite-element analysis was conducted to determine lamina strains around the bolt hole. Damage onset consisted of matrix cracks, delamination, and fiber failures.

Very little of this work has been directed at the seismic exploration imaging problem. In fact, {{most of the work}} has had application in sonar, medical and non-destructive testing applications. Here we present some initial results of applying this technology to the seismic imaging of a salt dome flank. We create a set of synthetic traces representing a multi-level, walk away VSP for a model composed of a simplified Gulf of Mexico vertical velocity gradient and an embedded overhanging salt dome. To process these data, we first apply the concepts of TRA to the synthetic traces. This creates a set of stacked traces without having to perform any velocity analysis or complicated processing. Each of these stacked traces is equivalent to the output of a spatially coincident, or zero <b>offset,</b> down <b>hole</b> source and receiver pair. Thus we have the equivalent of a zero offset seismic section as if it were collected from down hole sources and receivers. After having applied the TRA concepts, we then apply conventional post stack depth migration to this zero offset section to produce the final image of the salt dome flank. Our results show a very good image of the salt. In fact, the image created is nearly identical to an image actually using data from down <b>hole,</b> zero <b>offset</b> source and receiver pairs.

We use composite quasar spectra binned by black hole mass and redshift to assess galaxy features that would otherwise be overwhelmed by noise in individual spectra. The black hole mass is calculated using the photoionization method, and the host galaxy luminosity is inferred from the depth of the Ca II H + K features in the composite spectra. We evaluate the evolution in the M_bh - L_gal relationship by examining the redshift dependence of Delta log M_bh, the <b>offset</b> in black <b>hole</b> mass from the local black hole - bulge relationship.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of ion beamlet steering in which the direction of beamlets emitted from a two grid aperture system is controlled by relative translation of the grids, is described. The results {{can be used to}} design electrostatic accelerating devices for which the direction and focus of emerging beamlets are important. Deflection and divergence angle data are presented for two grid systems {{as a function of the}} relative lateral displacement of the holes in these grids. At large displacements, accelerator grid impingements become excessive and this determines the maximum allowable displacement and as a result the useful range of beamlet deflection. Beamlet deflection is shown to vary linearly with grid offset angle over this range. The divergence of the beamlets is found to be unaffected by deflection over the useful range of beamlet deflection. The grids of a typical dished grid ion thruster are examined to determine the effects of thermally induced grid distortion and prescribed <b>offsets</b> of grid <b>hole</b> centerlines on the characteristics of the emerging beamlets.

Using HST WFC 3 {{near-infrared}} imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), we select cluster galaxies and z ~ 1. 6 field galaxies with M_star >= 3 x 10 ^ 10 M_sun, {{and determine the}} frequency of double nuclei or close companions with projected separations less than 20 kpc co-moving and stellar mass ratios between 1 : 1 and roughly 10 : 1. We find that {{four out of five}} spectroscopically-confirmed massive proto-cluster galaxies have double nuclei, and 42 + 13 /- 25 % of all M_star >= 3 x 10 ^ 10 M_sun cluster candidates are either in close pair systems or have double nuclei. In contrast, only 4. 5 +/- 2. 6 % of the field galaxies are in close pair/double nuclei systems. The implied merger rate per massive galaxy in the proto-cluster is 3 - 10 times higher than the merger rate of massive field galaxies at z ~ 1. 6, depending upon the assumed mass ratios. Close pairs in the cluster have minor merger stellar mass ratios (M_primary:M_satellite ~ 6 : 1), while the field pairs are typically major mergers with stellar mass ratios between 1 : 1 and 4 : 1. At least half of the cluster mergers are dissipationless, as indicated by their red colors and low 24 micron fluxes.

40|$|On Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 138, {{standard}} shipboard {{procedures were}} modified {{to allow for}} the real-time monitoring of several laboratory core-scanning systems that provide centimeter-scale measurements of saturated bulk density, magnetic susceptibility and digital color reflectance. These continuous, high-resolution data sets were used to ensure the proper <b>offset</b> of multiple <b>holes</b> and to splice together complete sedimentary sections. Typically, the spliced, continuous sediment sections were found to be about 10 % longer than the section drilled, as measured by the length of the drill string. While the source of this elongation is not yet fully understood, it must be compensated for in order to property determine sediment fluxes and mass accumulation rates. Downhole logging, in conjunction with inverse correlation techniques provided a means to determine where the distortion occurred and to correct back to true in situ depths. Downhole logging also provides a means, through the generation of synthetic seismograms, of precisely relating the paleoceanographic events found in the core record to the high-resolution seismic record. Once correlated to the seismic record, the spatial and temporal extent of paleoceanographic events can be traced well beyond the borehole. Most seismic events in the equatorial Pacific are related to rapid changes in carbonate content that, in turn, are related to both productivity events (often expressed as monospecific laminated diatom oozes) and times of enhanced dissolution. While many of these events may have oceanwide extent, others, like the absence of carbonate in the late-Miocene to Recent in the Guatemala Basin {{have been shown to be}} regional and confined to only the deeper portions of the Guatemala Basin.

The ratio of impingement and effusion number of holes/m 2 (or hole density) n, investigated were impingement/effusion: 4306 / 4306 and 1076 / 4306, respectively. The geometries were for impingement wall, hole pitch X to diameter D, X/D ratio of ~ 11 but different number of holes N for both n geometries, at a constant <b>offset</b> effusion wall, <b>hole</b> X/D of 4. 7 of the same N for both the two configurations. The model geometries have a constant impingement gap of 8 mm with both impingement and effusion walls at 6. 35 mm thick Nimonic - 75 material and were computed for varied air mass flux G from 0. 1 - 0. 94 kg/sm 2. Symmetrical applications were employed in modelling each of the geometry, whereby for the impingement hole, only quarter of one hole was modelled, while for the effusion side the holes were either quarter or half modelled. The two n geometries were computed with k - ɛ turbulence model using standard wall functions, which also applies to all G. The predicted locally surface X 2 (or hole square area) average heat transfer coefficient (HTC) h values compared with with previously published experimental data showed good agreement. The reduced internal gap flow recirculation with reduced heat transfer to the impingement wall caused by increased number of effusion holes for unequal n impingement/effusion cooling design, shows that wall thermal gradient are higher than that found for equal n...|$|R
40|$|Publication date: December 1997 Geologic {{mapping of}} the igneous rocks of the Partridge River {{intrusion}} (PRI) within the Allen Quadrangle was {{conducted during the}} 1996 - 1997 period by Severson and Miller (1997). In addition to the surface geology, drill holes were logged {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the third-dimensional geology and Cu-Ni mineralization of the quadrangle. Drill hole correlations of igneous units, along with cross-sections and a discussion of Cu-Ni±PGE enriched zones, are presented in this report. Detailed logging of drill core from over 400 drill holes indicates that there are at least seven major igneous units (Units I through VII) within the basal 3, 000 feet of the PRI. These units, starting with Unit I at the base, are described in Severson and Hauck (1990) and are reiterated herein for drill holes within the Allen Quadrangle. Also present within the quadrangle and described in this report are late plug-like bodies of Oxide-bearing Ultramafic Intrusions (OUI), a Keweenawan sill within the Biwabik Iron-Formation (K-Sill), and a small Keweenawan(?) intrusive within the Archean rocks near a major fault zone. Establishment of an igneous stratigraphy for the PRI provides a framework that can be used to determine the nature and location of fault <b>offsets</b> between drill <b>holes.</b> The tenor of Cu-Ni mineralization is often locally increased along some of these faults. Fault zones, with or without increased mineralization, that are discussed in this report include faults in the Wetlegs Cu-Ni deposit, faults in the Wyman Creek Cu-Ni deposit, the Siphon Fault, and the Donora Fault. Many of these fault zones are depicted on the cross-sections that accompany this report. Enrichments in Platinum Group Elements (PGE) occur at several stratabound horizons within the Allen Quadrangle (using an arbitrary cutoff of > 90 ppb Pd). All of these PGE-enriched horizons are present in sulfide-bearing troctolitic rocks that are positioned immediately below, and in some cases within, laterally continuous ultramafic layers. However, the overall Pd content in some of the horizons shows a definite decrease in an east-to-west direction. This trend suggests that as the magma of the PRI was intruded, in an east-to-west direction(?), it became progressively impoverished with respect to PGEs...|$|R
40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an <b>offset</b> plate. The <b>holes</b> in the <b>offset</b> plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|R
