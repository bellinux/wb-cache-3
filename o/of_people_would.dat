5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E

25|$|Donated {{funds were}} used to {{purchase}} some farmsteads in the region, while other tracts within the proposed national park boundary were acquired by right of eminent domain. In contrast {{to the formation of}} other national parks in the sparsely populated American West, thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be forcibly relocated in the process of forming Mammoth Cave National Park. Often eminent domain proceedings were bitter, with landowners paid what were considered to be inadequate sums. The resulting acrimony still resonates within the region.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of Lviv {{strongly}} supported Viktor Yushchenko during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election {{and played a}} key role in the Orange Revolution. Hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> gather in freezing temperatures to demonstrate for the Orange camp. Acts of civil disobedience forced the head of the local police to resign and the local assembly issued a resolution refusing to accept the fraudulent first official results. Lviv remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation's political class.|$|E
25|$|The iPlayer {{received}} {{the approval of}} the BBC Trust on 30 April 2007, and an open beta for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 was launched at midnight on 27 July 2007, where it was announced that only a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be able to sign up for the service, with a controlled increase in users over the summer. The BBC had been criticised for saying that the iPlayer would 'launch' on 27 July 2007, when what was on offer was simply an extension of the beta to an open beta, admitting more users in a controlled manner. This was done reportedly to allow British ISPs and the BBC to gauge the effect of the iPlayer traffic on the Internet within the UK.|$|E

25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme. However, as {{the events of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affecting the album's recording so much, as this did not reflect their attempt to express everything that was happening in 2011, as opposed to just what happened to the band. For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be listening to Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E
25|$|The book covers {{almost all}} aspects of life in {{providing}} proper guidance of Islam such as the method of performing prayers and other actions of worship directly from the Prophet Muhammad. Bukhari finished his work around 846/232 AH, and spent the last twenty-four {{years of his life}} visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the hadith he had collected. In every city that Bukhari visited, thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> gather in the main mosque to listen to him recite traditions. In reply to Western academic doubts as to the actual date and authorship of the book that bears his name, scholars point out that notable hadith scholars of that time, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal (855 CE/241 AH), Yahya ibn Ma'in (847 CE/233 AH), and Ali ibn al-Madini (848 CE/234 AH), accepted the authenticity of his book and that the collection's immediate fame makes it unlikely {{that it could have been}} revised after the author's death without historical record.|$|E

A party constitution was adopted on 24 November 2012, when a National Council comprising 320 {{people and a}} National Executive of 23 were also formed. Both the Council and the Executive were expected to have more members in due course, with the intention being that all districts and all classes <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have a voice. Various committees were proposed to be formed to draft proposals for adoption by the party {{in a process that}} was expected to take several months. Although one aim was to limit nepotism, there were complaints at this initial meeting that the selection of people invited to attend was itself an example of such practices The party was formally launched in Delhi on 26 November and in March 2013 it was registered as a political party by the Election Commission of India.|$|E

25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on {{the south end of}} the lot, and {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the Times and the New York Tribune began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.|$|E
25|$|Also in 675, {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> {{fall victim to}} Empress Wu's ire. Empress Wu had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle, who had married the general Zhao Gui (趙瓌) and whose {{daughter}} had become the wife and princess of Wu's third son Li Xiǎn, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was therefore accused of unspecified crimes and put under arrest, eventually being starved to death. Zhao Gui and Princess Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince—who had been urging Empress Wu not to exercise so much influence on Emperor Gaozong's governance and who had offended Empress Wu by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao's daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng, who had been under house arrest, be allowed to marry—died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Empress Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. Li Xián, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince. Meanwhile, Consort Xiao's son Li Sujie and another son of Emperor Gaozong's, Li Shangjin (李上金), were repeatedly accused of crimes by Empress Wu and were demoted.|$|E

When shooting the music video, Jeremy Davis stated [...] "I've realized you can't really consider it making a music video unless you get hurt, because every video, we end up in pain ... It's awesome to do our own stunts; {{we might as well}} be Jackie Chan." [...] Taylor York adds [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love, but what was so appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ... He had so many ideas, and it definitely jumped out at us." ...|$|E
500|$|Chief Justice Yong {{held that}} any {{religious}} belief and practice which offended the [...] "sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore" [...] must be restrained. While {{there was no}} dispute that Jehovah's Witnesses were law-abiding citizens and their religious activities held no political agendas, their refusal to perform national service was, in the Minister's view, contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. In this regard, Chief Justice Yong considered {{the concerns of the}} Assistant Director of Manpower of the Ministry of Defence – if the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses were recognized, a select group <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> enjoy the social and economic benefits of their country without having to share the responsibility of defending the community's social and political institutions.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of these rumours and arguments, the belief {{strengthened}} among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers' advice, the government would resign en masse. The King responded, according to his own account later: [...] "I intend to marry Mrs. Simpson as soon as she is free to marry... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister had given me reason to believe it would, then I was prepared to go." [...] Under pressure from the King, and [...] "startled" [...] at the suggested abdication, Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options: ...|$|E
