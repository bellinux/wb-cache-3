25|$|Using an {{ordinary}} two-flute twist drill bit {{to enlarge the}} hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round,</b> off center and generally of poor finish.

25|$|At {{the test}} held {{immediately}} following the Valencia round, Stoner was once again fastest while testing the new 2010 version of the Desmosedici. However, Rossi was fastest {{in five of the}} six pre-season tests. Stoner qualified on pole for the season opener in Qatar, and was leading the race when he crashed out, later acknowledging that this was his own mistake. He also crashed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> 3 at Le Mans, this time attributing the crash {{to the front of the}} bike unloading when not running at maximum pace. His first podium of the year came at Assen, despite struggling with arm pump late in the race.|$|E
2500|$|Watt {{had tried}} unsuccessfully {{for several years}} to obtain an {{accurately}} bored cylinder for his steam engines, {{and was forced to}} use hammered iron, which was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> and caused leakage past the piston. Joseph Wickham Roe stated in 1916: [...] "When [...] Smeaton saw the first engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'Neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision.|$|E
2500|$|Bullets must be well {{balanced}} and consistent in weight, shape, and seating depth {{to ensure that}} they correctly engage the rifling, exit the barrel at a consistent velocity, and fly straight. [...] Buying bullets from a high quality source will help ensure quality, but for ultimate accuracy some shooters will measure even the best bullets, and reject all but the most consistent. [...] Measurement of the weight is the easiest, and bullets that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> can be detected by rotating the bullet while measuring with a micrometer. [...] There is even a device available that will detect changes in jacket thickness and internal voids in jacketed rifle bullets, though its high cost makes it prohibitively expensive for all but the most dedicated shooters.|$|E

5000|$|During the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in 1950, mortar {{sections}} {{under the}} United States Marine Corps {{started to run}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> mortar <b>rounds.</b> The radio men of these sections started requesting more rounds. There were too many nearby enemy anti-air emplacements however, and the risk that they might lose any airlifted supplies was too great, {{so they had to}} wait. After two days of waiting, all the mortar sections ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>rounds.</b> At this point they accidentally ordered hundreds of crates of Tootsie Roll candies instead <b>of</b> mortar <b>rounds.</b> This was because some elements of the United States military had used [...] "tootsie rolls" [...] as code for mortar rounds.|$|R
25|$|With captain James Horwill ruled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round's</b> 3 and 4 {{and with}} Hugh McMeniman also out injured, Sitaleki Timani {{was brought into}} the squad as cover for the second row, but kept {{his place in the}} squad for the final two rounds.

50|$|Each {{game will}} be one of twenty {{possible}} scenarios. Each scenario has a starting morale level, a starting zombie presence, a 'game length' in round number and a unique 'team' victory objective. The game can end in three ways: morale reaches 0, the players run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>rounds,</b> or the main objective is completed.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a notion of related-key {{rectangle}} attack using 4 related keys. It is based on two consecutive related-key differentials which are independent of each other.

5000|$|The piston sealing {{problem was}} due to having no way to produce a {{sufficiently}} round cylinder. Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round.</b> Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.

5000|$|True {{the wheel}} by {{knocking}} abrasive particles from the wheel's surface {{and making the}} wheel concentric. This minimizes vibration and improves surface finish, eliminating the vibration of the out-of-balance wheel across the workpiece's surface. It {{is not unusual for}} grinding wheels to become <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of the wheel wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when the wheel is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to the wheel to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|E
50|$|Player {{can send}} three of his/her {{recruited}} heroes to duel with other player for three rounds. If a player wins 2 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 3 <b>rounds,</b> he/she gain 250,000 gold; {{if a player}} win 3 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 3 <b>rounds,</b> he/she gain 350,000 gold. The result <b>of</b> each <b>round</b> is decided according to the hero's Strength (STR): affect the power of attack and chance of striking first in each turn, Intelligence (INT): affect the chance of dodge, and Charisma (CHA): affect the chance of deadly blow.|$|R

40|$|We devise {{the first}} closed formula {{for the number}} <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> a blockcipher with secret {{components}} so that these components can be revealed using multiset, algebraic-degree, or division-integral properties, {{which in this case}} are equivalent. Using the new result, we attack 7 (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> 9) <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> Kuznyechik, the recent Russian blockcipher standard, thus halving its security margin. With the same technique we attack 6 (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> 8) <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> Khazad, the legacy 64 -bit blockcipher. Finally, we show how to cryptanalyze and find a decomposition of generic SPN construction for which the inner-components are secret. All the attacks are the best to date...|$|R
5000|$|Typical main {{support ring}} factor of safety, if {{designed}} by [...] "Roark" [...] formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>round</b> standard tolerance) {{because it can}} be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..|$|E
