50|$|A {{proportioning}} valve is a valve {{that relies on}} the statics to supply a reduced pressure to an <b>output</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each {{input line}} card spreads its packets evenly to the N buffers, {{something}} it can clearly do without contention. Each buffer writes these packets {{into a single}} buffer-local memory at a combined rate of R. Simultaneously, each buffer sends packets {{at the head of}} each virtual output queue to each <b>output</b> <b>line</b> card, again at rate R/N to each card. The <b>output</b> <b>line</b> card can clearly forward these packets out the line with no contention.|$|E
50|$|Air core gauges {{require special}} {{electronics}} to properly drive the coils. Some driver integrated circuits have a serial input data port and two pair of <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b> One pair of the <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> drives the sin coil and one pair drives the cos coil.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 other <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> for {{the status}} flags N (negative) and Z (zero).|$|R
5000|$|The {{display section}} has eight <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> {{divided into two}} groups A0-A3 and B0-B3.|$|R
50|$|Up {{to a full}} line must be {{buffered}} {{from each}} input file during line comparison, before the next <b>output</b> <b>line</b> is written.|$|E
50|$|This allows {{multiple}} circuits {{to share}} the same <b>output</b> <b>line</b> or lines (such as a bus which cannot listen {{to more than one}} device at a time).|$|E
50|$|Darlington {{transistors}} {{can be used}} in high-current circuits, such {{as those}} involving computer control of motors or relays. The current is amplified from the normal low level of the computer <b>output</b> <b>line</b> to the amount needed by the connected device.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> are {{connected}} to the anodes through driver transistor in case of common cathode 7-segment LEDs.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} a {{self-checking}} synchronous Finite State Machine (FSM) network design with low overhead is developed. Checkers are {{used only for}} FSMs, which <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> are {{at the same time}} <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> of the network. The checkers observe <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> of these FSMs. The method is based on reducing the problem to a self-checking synchronous FSM design. The latter is provided by applying a special description of FSM namely, so-called unate Programmable Logic Array (PLAu) description. Single stuck-at fault on the FSM poles and gate poles are considered. PLAu realization of FSM allows a factorized or multilevel logic synthesis. They both provide a unidirectional manifestation of the above mentioned faults on the <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> of the corresponding FSMs. This realization also gives rise to a transparency of each component FSM of the network for the faults. PLAu realization is derived from the State Transition Graph (STG) description of FSMs with using the m-out-of-n encoding of its states and insignificant expanding the products of STG. The problem of replacing an arbitrary synchronous FSM network for the self-checking one with low overhead is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{device is}} {{described}} which has 10 input and 2 <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b> Grounding an input causes a pulse {{with a specific}} amplitude, polarity, and duration to appear {{on one of the}} <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b> Pulse parameters can be set by front-panel controls. Thus, 10 distinct events can be coded by associating a unique pulse with each event. These pulses can be recorded on one (or two) channels of a magnetic tape recorder for subsequent processing. The use of this coder in the study of event-related potentials is described...|$|R
50|$|The {{short-circuit}} power component. During {{the transition}} of the <b>output</b> <b>line</b> (of a CMOS gate) from one voltage level to the other, there {{is a period of}} time when both the PMOS and the NMOS transistors are on, thus creating a path from VDD to ground.|$|E
5000|$|To help users {{keep track}} of what command, command subsystem, or program they are working with and when input is expected, MTS {{displays}} a prefix character or sometimes a prefix string at the front of each input and <b>output</b> <b>line</b> it writes to the user's terminal. The common prefixes are: ...|$|E
50|$|Clarence Moore {{tried to}} obtain {{permission}} to continue broadcasting church services but the FCC denied it. After {{a few years}} another {{attempt was made to}} reduce power and limit broadcasting to only the college campus. The <b>output</b> <b>line</b> was rerouted but the station could not continue to broadcast because of too much power.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> {{can be used}} {{either as}} a single group of eight lines or as two groups of four lines, in {{conjunction}} with the scan lines for a multiplexed display.|$|R
5000|$|FBP {{components}} often form complementary pairs. This example uses {{two such}} pairs. The problem described seems very simple {{as described in}} words, but in fact is surprisingly difficult to accomplish using conventional procedural logic. The task, called the [...] "Telegram Problem", originally described by Peter Naur, is to write a program which accepts lines of text and generates <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> containing as many words as possible, where the number of characters in each line does not exceed a certain length. The words may not be split and we assume no word is longer than {{the size of the}} <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b> This is analogous to the word-wrapping problem in text editors.|$|R
25|$|The outputs {{that can}} be {{realized}} from the D-17B computer are binary, discrete, single character, phase register status, telemetry, and voltage outputs. Binary outputs are computer generated levels of +1 or −1 available on the binary <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main signal pins on an 8259 are as follows: eight {{interrupt}} input request lines named IRQ0 through IRQ7, an {{interrupt request}} <b>output</b> <b>line</b> named INTR, interrupt acknowledgment line named INTA, D0 through D7 for communicating the interrupt level or vector offset. Other connections include CAS0 through CAS2 for cascading between 8259s.|$|E
50|$|The prism is {{commonly}} used to separate a single required wavelength from a light beam containing multiple wavelengths, such as a particular <b>output</b> <b>line</b> from a multi-line laser due to its ability to separate beams even after they have undergone a non-linear frequency conversion. For this reason, they are also commonly used in optical atomic spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{a printer}} <b>output</b> <b>line</b> {{transistor}} would fail, {{resulting in a}} blank print position. If you knew your way around inside the 1130, {{it was possible to}} swap circuit cards so as to move the bad print position to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up.|$|E
50|$|A simple encoder circuit is a one-hot to binary converter. That is, {{if there}} are 2n input lines, and at most {{only one of them}} will ever be high, the binary code of this 'hot' line is {{produced}} on the n-bit <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Discrete - The {{discrete}} outputs provide {{two independent}} sets of <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> (32 and 15) {{for a total}} of 47 [...] "on - off" [...] type signals. The outputs are modified under program control and are sent to equipment external to the computer.|$|R
50|$|In unibit PLLs, {{the output}} {{frequency}} {{is defined by}} the input frequency and the modulo count of the two counters. In each counter, only the most significant bit (MSB) is used. The other <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> of the counters are ignored; this is wasted information.|$|R
50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure to the right, a load-balanced switch has N input line cards, each of rate R, each {{connected}} to N buffers by a link of rate R/N. Those buffers are in turn each connected to N <b>output</b> <b>line</b> cards, each of rate R, by links of rate R/N. The buffers in the center are partitioned into N virtual output queues.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{two-dimensional}} array of pixels is organized into rows and columns. Pixels {{in a given}} row share reset lines, so that a whole row is reset at a time. The row select lines of each pixel in a row are tied together as well. The outputs of each pixel in any given column are tied together. Since only one row is selected at a given time, no competition for the <b>output</b> <b>line</b> occurs. Further amplifier circuitry is typically on a column basis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of RTS control flow, DTE sets its RTS, which signals the {{opposite}} end (the slave end such as a DCE) to begin monitoring its data input line. When ready for data, the slave end will raise its complementary line, CTS in this example, which signals the master to start sending data, and for the master to begin monitoring the slave's data <b>output</b> <b>line.</b> If either end needs to stop the data, it lowers its respective [...] "data readyness" [...] line.|$|E
40|$|An event {{sequence}} detector {{is described}} with input units, each {{associated with a}} row of bistable elements arranged {{in an array of}} rows and columns. The detector also includes a shift register which is responsive to clock pulses from any of the units to sequentially provide signals on its <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> each of which is connected to the bistable elements in a corresponding column. When the event-indicating signal is received by an input unit it provides a clock pulse to the shift register to provide the signal on one of its <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b> The input unit also enables all its bistable elements so that the particular element in the column supplied with the signal from the register is driven to an event-indicating state...|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for defining self-checking sequential architectures {{is presented in}} the paper. A m-out-of-n encoding of the juxtaposition of next-state and output eventually completed with additional <b>output</b> <b>lines,</b> is provided. The goal is guaranteeing detection of single and multiple unidirectional errors while minimizing area overhead...|$|R

50|$|The IO-204 {{has four}} GPIO channels. Each channel {{includes}} a 5 V power line, a ground connection, digital input pin, analog input pin, and a digital output pin. The digital input line {{is capable of}} reading voltages of 0 V and 5 V and pulse counting. The analog input is 10-bit resolution for voltages varying between 0 V and 5 V. The digital <b>output</b> <b>line</b> outputs 0 V and 5 V at 20 mA and is capable of sending pulses and serial data.|$|E
50|$|If {{the outlet}} {{of the line}} is {{at a higher level}} than the tank of the pump, a check valve is often fitted at the outlet of the pump so that liquid cannot flow {{backwards}} into the pump's tank. If the outlet is below the tank level, siphonage usually naturally clears the <b>output</b> <b>line</b> of all liquid when the pump is deenergized. In cold regions of the world, it is important that condensate lines that are exhausted outside be carefully designed so that no water can remain in the line to freeze up; this would block the line from further operation.|$|E
50|$|In general, modern {{professional}} equipment is now all-digital, and uses component-based digital interconnects such as CCIR 601 {{to eliminate the}} need for any analog processing prior to the final modulation of the analog signal for broadcast. However, large installed bases of analog {{professional equipment}} still exist, particularly in third world countries. In most cases all processing within the TV-station is PAL and on the <b>output</b> <b>line</b> a PAL to SECAM transcoder is used before feeding the transmitter. This is because switchers and effect mixers can easily handle PAL (or NTSC) but the SECAM signal can't be mixed in the same way due to the frequency modulation of the color information.|$|E
50|$|Voltage - There {{are four}} dc voltage <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> {{available}} with each proportional to an 8-bit number including the sign. These lines are updated {{at the rate}} of 9.27 volts per 32 word times. The range is + 10 volts with an accuracy of ± 200 mv.|$|R
5000|$|The third bank of rotors {{was called}} the index rotors. These rotors were smaller, with only ten contacts, and did not step during the encryption. After {{travelling}} though the index rotors, one to four of five <b>output</b> <b>lines</b> would have power. These then turned the cypher rotors.|$|R
50|$|A Simple Encoder {{or simply}} an encoder in digital {{electronics}} is a one-hot to binary converter. That is, {{if there are}} 2n input lines, and at most {{only one of them}} will ever be high, the binary code of this 'hot' line is produced on the n-bit <b>output</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
