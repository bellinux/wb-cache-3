5|$|Filmmaker Lee Groberg and writer/historian Heidi Swinton {{created a}} {{documentary}} for PBS, Sweetwater Rescue: The Willie & Martin Handcart Story, which features reenactments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> The one-hour film was shown nationally in the United States on December 18, 2006. A companion book was also published.|$|E
5|$|News <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid. The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E

Further, both the viability review and the proposed capital structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescued</b> entity must be carefully assessed...|$|R

5|$|On 13 December 1966, a {{retention}} {{order was}} issued that included both episodes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rescue</b> to be retained by the BBC. However, both episodes were wiped, {{the first on}} 17 August 1967 and the second on 31 January 1969. Fortunately, BBC Enterprises had retained both episodes and returned them to the BBC in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The added deaths, loss of aircraft, {{and length}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> {{operation}} led the USAF {{to change the}} way they planned and conducted search and rescue missions. As a result, they developed new techniques and equipment to improve their ability to rescue downed airmen.|$|E
5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures than had been on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue,</b> Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to the United States, Winslow resumed peacetime duty with the Atlantic Fleet. During May, she served as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> pickets {{stationed}} along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After that, the destroyer returned to normal operations along the east coast and annual winter maneuvers in Cuban waters until placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia on 10 December 1919.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November, which ended all fighting, O'Brien transported mail and {{passengers}} between Brest, France, and Plymouth, England. She returned to New York on 8 January 1919, but returned to European waters in May when she served as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> pickets stationed along the route across the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|As many as 90 sorties a {{day were}} called in to {{suppress}} North Vietnamese forces around Hambleton. In contrast, prior to the Easter Offensive, the number of daily sorties was about 10, and during the action, peaked at about 300. During the multi-day effort to rescue the men, the Americans hit the North Vietnamese with over 800 air strikes in direct support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> Search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets.|$|E

5|$|During Operation Red Wings on 28 June 2005, four Navy SEALs, {{pinned down}} in a firefight, radioed for help. A Chinook helicopter, {{carrying}} 16 service members, responded but was shot down. All members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> team and three of four SEALs on the ground died. It was the worst loss of life in Afghanistan since the invasion in 2001. The Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell alone survived. Team leader Michael P. Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in danger of being attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Rescue was {{produced}} in a six-episode block with The Romans {{and was the first}} story produced in Doctor Who second production block. Rehearsals and recording took place from 30 November to 11 December 1964, entirely in-studio. The two episodes were watched by 12 and 13 million viewers in the UK respectively and have received generally positive reviews from critics, who praise the character-based storytelling, although plot holes were noted. Both episodes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rescue</b> have been retained in the BBC archives, and the story has been novelised and released on VHS and DVD. The serial is notable as the first appearance of Maureen O'Brien as companion Vicki.|$|E

5|$|The rescue {{was led by}} the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and {{it became}} the largest rescue in that institution's 190-year history. RNLI lifeboats, manned by local volunteers from {{stations}} at the Lizard, Cadgwith, Coverack and Porthleven, rescued all the passengers, including 70 babies, {{as well as the}} crew. The operation took 16 hours to complete. As a result of the successful efforts of the rescuers, four silver RNLI medals were awarded to various volunteers and two were awarded to Suevic crew members for their actions. In March 2007 a ceremony was held to commemorate the 100th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed {{with no sign of}} the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E

It operates HH-60 Pave Hawk aircraft conducting peacetime and combat {{search and rescue}} missions.|$|R
5|$|The {{network was}} also used heavily by {{government}} officials and rescue personnel, who used PDAs or laptops to {{log on to the}} network. It was used by rescue workers who were floating {{in the middle of the}} river and who could receive the signal to communicate with the headquarters in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> operations. The wireless service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of the network essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant {{to major}} {{general in the}} regular army and assigned him command of the newly formed Division of the Mississippi on October 16, 1863, including the Armies of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland. After the Battle of Chickamauga, the Army of the Cumberland retreated into Chattanooga, where they were trapped. When informed of the situation, Grant put Major General George H. Thomas in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue.</b> Taking command, Grant arrived in Chattanooga by horseback, with plans to resupply the city and break the siege. Lincoln also sent Major General Joseph Hooker and two divisions of the Army of the Potomac to assist. Union forces captured Brown's Ferry and opened a supply line to Bridgeport. On November 23, Grant organized three armies to attack at Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. Two days later, Hooker's forces took Lookout Mountain. Grant ordered Thomas and the Army of the Cumberland to advance when Sherman's army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast. The Army of the Cumberland, led by Major General Philip Sheridan and Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood, charged uphill and captured the Confederate entrenchments at the top, forcing the rebels into retreat. The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened Georgia, the Confederate heartland, to Union invasion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} already {{crowding}} round the captives, relieving {{them from their}} bonds and, in many cases, embracing and weeping on their necks, for among them were many friends and relations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescuing</b> party.|$|R
