5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
25|$|Vasculitis {{resulting}} in occlusion of the vessels supplying the optic nerve {{may be the}} cause of acute optic neuropathy and progressive <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy</b> in Behçet's disease. Histological evaluation in a reported case of acute optic neuropathy demonstrated substitution of the axonal portion of the optic nerve with fibrous astrocytes without retinal changes. CNS involvement in Behçet's disease may lead to intracranial hypertension most commonly due to dural venous sinus thrombosis and subsequent secondary <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy.</b>|$|E

25|$|In an {{epidemiologic}} study, 56 {{percent of}} patients with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at {{a mean age of}} 30. Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 {{percent of patients}}. Ocular Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy</b> was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{prognosis}} is generally good with prompt diagnosis and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment. Inner ear symptoms usually respond to corticosteroid therapy within weeks to months; hearing usually recovers completely. Chronic eye effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy</b> can occur. Skin changes usually persist despite therapy.|$|E
25|$|As for the retina, the {{syndrome}} causes retinocephalic vascular malformations {{that tend to}} be present with intracranial hemorrhage and lead to decreased visual acuity, proptosis, pupillary defects, <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> congestion of bulbar conjunctiva, and visual field defects.

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's Disease. Progressive <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy</b> may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} and signs that suggest {{a rise in}} ICP including headache, vomiting without nausea, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy,</b> and eventually blindness. The headache is classically a morning headache which may wake them from sleep. The brain is relatively poorly supplied by oxygen {{as a result of}} mild hypoventilation during the sleeping hours, and also cerebral edema may worsen during the night due to the lying position. The headache is worse on coughing / sneezing / bending, and progressively worsens over time. There may also be personality or behavioral changes.|$|E
25|$|Given its rarity, {{the optimal}} {{treatment}} for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease {{has not been}} established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment {{may be required to}} prevent <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy</b> in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.|$|E
30|$|Main {{causes of}} serious vision loss in Behçet’s uveitis include <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy,</b> macular damage, and retinal {{vascular}} occlusions causing ischemic retinopathy with neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular glaucoma [1, 2, 5, 6].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of glaucomatous <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy</b> among a working population in Germany by secondary evaluation of a study conducted to estimate the prevalence of retinal microangiopathic abnormalities by telemedical examination of the retina. Patients and Methods: From August 2002 until January 2004 the retina and optic nerve head were examined in 19, 294 Caucasians using a non-mydriatic fundus camera (Kowa, nonmyd-alpha 45), which produces colour images with 45 degrees. The images of the retina and optic nerve head were evaluated telemedically by glaucoma specialists in respect to optic nerve pathologies and microangiopathic abnormalities by a standardised procedure. Glaucomatous <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy</b> was diagnosed when specific glaucomatous morphological alterations of the optic nerve head were present. A complete medical history including reported elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and blood pressure was obtained. Results: The intra-observer and inter-observer reliability were 0. 884 and 0. 740, respectively. Cronbach's alpha for two evaluation cycles each of two observers was 0. 870. The prevalences of glaucomatous <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy</b> in the different age groups were 0. 07 % (45 - 49 years), 0. 40 % (50 - 54 years), 0. 45 % (55 - 59 years) and 0. 82 % (60 - 64 years). Age could be established as an important risk factor for glaucomatous <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy,</b> while no influence of gender or family history was found. Conclusion: Telemedical evaluation of colour images of the retina and optic nerve acquired by a non-mydriatic fundus camera allows a fast and efficient screening of many subjects with medium reliability...|$|R
25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and <b>optic</b> <b>atrophy.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{characterize}} ocular abnormalities {{associated with}} iris atrophy in DBA/ 2 J mice {{and to determine}} whether mice of this strain develop elevated intraocular pressure GOP) an d glaucoma. METHODS. Different approaches, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopic examination, ultrasound backscatter microscopy, and histology were {{used to examine the}} eyes of DBA/ 2 J mice ranging from 2 to 30 months old. IOP was measured in DBA/ 2 J mice of different ages. RESULTS. DBA/ 2 J mice were found to develop pigment dispersion, iris transillumination, iris atrophy, anterior synechias, and elevated IOP. IOP was elevated in most mice by the age of 9 months. These changes were followed by the death of retinal ganglion cells, <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy,</b> and <b>optic</b> nerve cupping. The prevalence and severity of these lesions increased with age. <b>Optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy</b> and <b>optic</b> nerve cupping was present in the majority of mice by the age of 22 months. CONCLUSIONS. DBA/ 2 J mice develop a progressive form of secondary angle-closure glaucoma that appears to be initiated by iris atrophy and the associated formation of synechias. This mouse strain represents a useful model to evaluate mechanisms of pressure-related ganglion cell death and <b>optic</b> nerve <b>atrophy,</b> and to evaluate strategies for neviroprotection.
