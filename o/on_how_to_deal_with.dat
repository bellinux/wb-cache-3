5|$|In 1965 {{the term}} design {{management}} {{was first published}} {{in a series of articles}} in the Design Journal. This series includes a pre-publication of the first chapter of the book Design Management by Michael Farr, which is considered as the first comprehensive literature on design management. His thoughts on system theory and project management led to a framework <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> design as a business function at the corporate management level by providing the language and methodology to effectively manage it.|$|E

5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low {{regard for the}} simple life they led and also for their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying {{in the last quarter of}} the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm and Vaudreuil, {{who did not}} {{get along}} with each other, {{differed}} <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the British threat. They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and {{a limited number of}} Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000. Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.|$|E

5|$|The {{views of}} the Croatian {{leadership}} <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the JNA's role in the Croatian Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991. Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's initial plan was to win European Community (EC) and United States support, so he dismissed Špegelj's advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in Croatia in late 1990. During the Ten-Day War in June and July 1991, Špegelj once again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money.

30|$|Another {{significant}} {{aspect of}} the problem is the insufficient exposure to computer technologies, which deters full utilization of computer technology devices by many Saudi EFL learners. Most students have minimal or no experience in using computers and those who know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use computers employ these merely for entertainment and communication. Information communication technology (ICT) implementation without preparation and training <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> and use these technology tools properly might affect the learning process. The successful use of technologies can be largely detected in the attitudes and willingness of students to use these technology tools, which could lead to the successful utilization of these tools in the classroom. Albirini (2006) supports this view and states that the attitudes and willingness of learners toward using technology mainly value the successful use of technology in the educational settings.|$|R

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

5|$|The Kangxi Emperor reverted many of {{the bureaucratic}} reforms of the Oboi faction after 1669, but {{continued}} {{to rely on the}} Deliberative Council as a body of Manchu counselors whom he consulted {{on a wide variety of}} military and civil matters, especially those that were too sensitive or complex to handle through the regular bureaucracy. The emperor allowed the president of the Censorate to sit on the Council, then in 1683, after the rebellion of the Three Feudatories had been suppressed and peace reestablished, he decided that the lieutenant-generals of the Banners would no longer be automatic members. After that, the Deliberative Council became more oriented toward civil administration. Nonetheless during the First Oirat–Manchu War, fought from 1687 to 1697 between the Qing Empire and the Dzungar Khanate, the Kangxi Emperor often consulted the Council <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Galdan, the khan of the Dzungars, and with the Dzungars' enemies the Khalkha Mongols. During his reign, the Council met on imperial request and transmitted the result of its deliberations to the emperor, who usually followed the Council's advice.|$|E

40|$|Purpose- The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the supply chain risks and uncertainties plaguing the Kenya petroleum industry and provide recommendations on mitigation strategies that can be applied to reduce their impact. Methodology- The research is of qualitative nature and the primary method of collecting data is through semi-structured interviews. Four experts from oil companies namely: Kenya Pipeline Ltd, Sifa Energy Ltd, Galana Petroleum Ltd and Riva Petroleum Ltd are interviewed. Secondary data from past literature on the topic is used to provide a basis of reference on the report. Findings- The research found that uncertainties are categorized as internal and external sources which consist of supply uncertainty, demand uncertainty, technology uncertainty and general environmental factors. Risks are placed under three categories: environmental, organisational and product related risk. Mitigation strategies were found <b>to</b> concentrate <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> impact more than <b>how</b> <b>to</b> avoid risks and uncertainties. Recommendations- Based on the research carried out, the recommendations made include: broader divestiture of generating facilities, close cooperation with the government so as to have mutual understanding, IT systems to strengthen monitoring and more firms in the country to transport and store the product...|$|R

40|$|Many {{companies}} consider {{investments in}} complaint handling as means of increasing customer commitment and building customer loyalty. Firms {{are not well}} informed, however, <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> successfully with service failures or the impact of complaint handling strategies. In this study, the authors find {{that a majority of}} complaining customers were dissatisfied with recent complaint handling experiences. Using justice theory, the authors also demonstrate that customers evaluate complaint incidents in terms of the outcomes they receive, the procedures used to arrive at the outcomes, {{and the nature of the}} interpersonal treatment during the process. In turn, the authors develop and test competing hypotheses regarding the interplay between satisfaction with complaint handling and prior experi-ence in shaping customer trust and commitment. The results support a quasi "brand equity " perspective—whereas satisfaction with complaint handling has a direct impact on trust and commitment, prior positive experiences miti-gate, to a limited extent, the effects of poor complaint handling. Implications for managers and scholars are discussed. Considerable evidence indicates tbat recovering effec-tively from service failures contributes to customerevaluations of firtns. Effective complaint handling can have a dramatic impact on customer retention rates, deflect tbe spread of damaging word of mouth, and improve bottom-line performance (e. g., Fornell and Wemerfelt 1987...|$|R
