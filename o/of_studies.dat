Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{available}} {{studies on}} business and management fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> as upwardly-mobile university field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choices as a basis, this study seeks {{to test this}} hypothesis of upward mobility. In doing so, it endeavours to identify correlations between field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choice and educational background and between field <b>of</b> <b>study</b> choice and gender. The base data is taken from a survey of all domestic first-time students at Austrian universities in the 2011 / 12 winter semester (N= 27, 575). This data was subjected to a correspondence analysis, which allowed us to visualise and interpret the relations between the positions of these fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in the university space. The results indicate a clearly structured (stratified) university space. Our supplementary regression analysis shows that the upwardly-mobile higher education choice hypothesis can be confirmed for the fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> studied. Our analyses also confirm the feminisation hypothesis for the business and management fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> studied: women significantly more frequently select fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> which lead to a career in a pedagogic (business education), social (social economy) or language (international business and management) context. In the group <b>of</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> explored, business education fields <b>of</b> <b>study</b> had both the highest share of first-time students and the highest level of feminisation. In contrast, economics fields <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> which was included in the analysis in addition to the business studies and management fields <b>of</b> <b>study,</b> have a significantly higher share of male students and the lowest share of higher education climbers.

This research was {{based on the fact that}} writing a text or background <b>of</b> <b>study</b> in this case is complex and difficult.
