5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's {{opinions}} of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You just have to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the name is not clearly <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> known. Some guess {{it comes from the}} kelts who lived before the Germans came. Others guess it comes from old high German from daha, which means clay, and ouwe (water overflown land).|$|E
500|$|Murder {{has never}} been statutorily defined, despite being {{recognised}} as either the most serious crime, <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> among them. The actus reus (prohibited act) of murder, unlawfully causing the death of another person, fits the general provisions for homicide. The mens rea (mental element) of murder was long held to be [...] "malice aforethought", which took on a meaning only of the required mental state for murder, since malice aforethought required neither malice (compassionate killing is still murder) nor aforethought (no premeditation is required). It is this mental component that marks murder out from manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, you might even wonder <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E

2500|$|What {{has long}} made this an {{interesting}} case to {{study is the}} fact that this scenario is globally inferior to [...] "both cooperating". That is, both players {{would be better off if}} they both chose to [...] "cooperate" [...] instead of both choosing to defect. However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (<b>or</b> <b>certainly)</b> changes their decision.|$|E

6000|$|This is {{the proper}} {{approach}} to the poems {{at the beginning of}} [...] "Lustra," [...] and to the short epigrams, which some readers find [...] "pointless," [...] <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> [...] "not poetry." [...] They should read, then, the [...] "Dance Figure," [...] or [...] "Near Périgord," [...] and remember that all these poems come out of the same man.|$|E

"This {{is a good}} boat, and a fast boat too," [...] {{observed}} Jack Tier, {{after he}} had luffed up several minutes, {{in order to make}} sure of his proximity to the reef; [...] "and it might carry us all safe enough to Key West, <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> back to the Dry Tortugas, was we inclined to try our hands at either." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{a solitary}} sail was visible. She {{appeared}} to be a ship of size, close-hauled, heading to the southward and eastward: by steering on our proper course, <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> by diverging a little to the northward, it would be an easy matter to speak her. As I could plainly see she was not a ship of war, my plan was formed in a moment. On communicating it to Marble, it met with his entire approbation. Measures were taken, accordingly, to carry it into immediate execution.|$|E
60|$|She {{had fallen}} a victim {{to a mental}} disease, the source of which I have no {{hesitation}} in saying {{has not yet been}} properly investigated. So far as I know there is no monograph on the subject, <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> I would have read it up carefully {{for the purpose of this}} Christmas Annual. I cannot get on without a mad woman in my stories, and if I can't find a proper case in the medical books, why, I invent one, or take it from the French. This one I have invented.|$|E

6000|$|And now we sailed southerly, living {{sparingly}} on our provisions, {{and went}} no oftener on shore {{than we were}} obliged for fresh water.

If Providence did not so favour me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose my life among the Negroes. And in a word, I put my whole stress upon this, [...] "Either that I must meet with some ship <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> perish." ...|$|E

60|$|The baronet {{was so much}} in {{the habit}} of seeing his humble neighbours, that an {{intimacy}} had grown up between them. Sir Wycherly, who was anything but an acute observer, felt an interest in the melancholy-looking, and almost heart-broken mother, without knowing why; <b>or</b> <b>certainly</b> without suspecting the real character of her habitual sadness; while Mildred's youth and beauty had not failed of producing the customary effect of making a friend of the old bachelor. He shook hands all round, therefore, with great cordiality; expressing his joy at meeting Mrs. Dutton, and congratulating the daughter on her complete recovery.|$|E
60|$|The signora couldn't follow her, <b>or</b> she <b>certainly</b> {{would have}} done so.

30|$|The general {{characteristic}} function method introduced above {{can be used}} to any kinds of hyperbolic–parabolic mixed type equations to find a reasonable analytic expression of the partial boundary value condition (1.6), no matter the domain Ω is bounded <b>or</b> not. <b>Certainly,</b> for different domains, one should choose different general {{characteristic function}}s.|$|R
