5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense.</b> Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E
5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, many aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by putting up a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also {{stepped up to the}} challenge and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

Maryland's prior offense attempted to run a version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flex <b>offense</b> that allowed for closer shots at the basket, and was less focused on obtaining open perimeter jump shots. Boston College under Coach Al Skinner also ran the flex; the BC version was very compact, creating an extremely physical game and limiting a team's ability to help because <b>of</b> how collapsed <b>the</b> floor is.|$|R
5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense.</b> Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Several Michigan {{school records}} were broken or tied in the blowout win.

Their 57-point win tied the second-biggest margin of victory for them since 1950, and tied for the eighth-largest margin of victory in school history. The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record. Because of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense,</b> the team did not punt the ball once, the first time this has happened since 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Boston College offense, which gained 319 {{yards per}} game on average, was ranked 94th (of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams) in total offense. A key {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> was guard Cliff Ramsey, who was named a first-team All-ACC selection, signifying his status as the best player at his position in the conference. Tight end Ryan Purvis was named a second-team All-ACC selection. Quarterback Dominique Davis led the Eagles' offense on the field heading into the ACC Championship. Davis had been the second-string quarterback until a season-ending injury to starter Chris Crane. During his limited time in the regular season, Davis had three passing and two rushing touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} {{worse than the}} national average during the regular season. The Hokies were ranked No. 64 in total offense, averaging 374.09 yards per game. In particular, Tech's passing offense was lacking. That segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> was ranked No. 86, averaging 179.36 yards. This figure was somewhat balanced by the Hokies' rushing attack, which was ranked No. 55 (194.73 ypg). Despite the worse-than-average yardage totals, Tech was ranked No. 25 in scoring offense, or 32.64 points per game. Prior to the Gator Bowl, it was announced that Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle would be leaving the team to take the same position at the Louisiana-Lafayette. Despite the move, he confirmed he would coach the Hokies during the bowl game in his last act as a Virginia Tech coach.|$|E
5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense.</b> This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh {{was named}} {{as one of}} Toronto's team captains. Bosh {{continued}} {{to work on his}} game as he consistently chalked up double doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage {{for the first half of}} the season. On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference. He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh, the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid. This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense,</b> as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.|$|E

5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked for a big loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed a pass to near midfield, making up the yardage that had been lost on the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack {{and appeared to be}} ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt and threw a pass to an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a {{comfortable}} lead to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, including a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As he went down, sensing blitzers about to wallop him, he stuck the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. Liking the effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> with several versions for different situations. As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
