50|$|World Bank's {{assessment}} tool the EDGE software (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) illustrates the potential issues with discomfort in buildings and {{has created the}} concept of Virtual Energy for Comfort which provides {{for a way to}} present potential thermal discomfort. This approach is used to award for design solutions which improves thermal comfort even in a fully free running building.Despite the inclusion of requirements for overheating in CIBSE, <b>overcooling</b> has not been assessed. However, <b>overcooling</b> can be an issue, mainly in the developing world, for example in cities such as Lima (Peru), Bogota, and Delhi, where cooler indoor temperatures can occur frequently. This may be a new area for research and design guidance for reduction of discomfort.|$|E
50|$|Although a high cooling {{temperature}} is more efficient, <b>overcooling</b> of smaller server rooms can provide reserve thermal {{protection in the}} event of cooling system failure, or in outage situations where the computers are provided emergency backup power but cooling systems are not. In such situations, the equipment can continue to run and tolerate several degrees of temperature rise before system damage from overheating occurs. Environmental reserve cooling capacity may not be feasible in dense equipment environments such as datacenters, but those locations {{are more likely to have}} backup cooling and emergency power for cooling.|$|E
40|$|An {{ordinary}} {{air conditioner}} {{in a very}} humid environment must <b>overcool</b> the room air, then reheat it. Mr. Dinh, a former STAC associate, devised a heat pipe based humidifier under a NASA Contract. The system used heat pipes to precool the air; the air conditioner's cooling coil removes heat and humidity, then the heat pipes restore the <b>overcooled</b> air to a comfortable temperature. The heat pipes use no energy, and typical savings are from 15 - 20 %. The Dinh Company also manufactures a "Z" coil, a retrofit cooling coil which may be installed on an existing heater/air conditioner. It will also provide free hot water. The company has also developed a photovoltaic air conditioner and solar powered water pump...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} accurately predict heat transfer in turbomachinery. For efficient gas turbine operation, flow temperatures in the hot gas path exceed acceptable metal temperatures in many regions of the engine. So that the integrity of the parts can be maintained for an acceptable engine life, the parts must be cooled. Efficient cooling schemes require accurate heat transfer prediction to minimize regions that are <b>overcooled</b> and, even more importantly, to ensure adequate cooling in high-heat-flux regions...|$|R
50|$|Gas cooking {{efficiencies}} may {{be lower}} if waste heat generation is taken into account. Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas. Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting {{may be needed}} to adequately condition hot areas without <b>overcooling</b> other areas. Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule. Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.|$|E
50|$|The Zapatilla {{was minimal}} indeed, with no doors or windows or reverse gear. The 1 cylinder, 197 cc, {{two-stroke}} motor produced 9 horsepower (7 kW), had a crank starter, and drove only the right front wheel. It had a large, oil-filled cylinder head, to compensate overheating during traffic light arrests, and avoid <b>overcooling</b> while on road at higher speeds, producing a: 'Temperature Buffer' effect. Braking was by an unusual three-point system involving the transmission and cable {{ties to the}} two rear wheels. One genuinely advanced feature was an all-aluminum body, although steel was later used.|$|E
5000|$|IT vendors {{recommend}} maintaining {{temperature of}} 70 - 75 F. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) {{states that the}} recommended temperatures is between 68 - 77 F, with an allowable range spanning 59 - 90 F. Research has shown, however, {{that the practice of}} keeping data centers at or below 70 F may be wasting money and energy.

40|$|As a {{powerful}} real-time and in-situ elemental analysis technique, {{laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy}} (LIBS) has attracted more and more interests. To develop an ultrasensitive and highly accurate trace element detection system based on LIBS, {{it is necessary to}} improve the LIBS detection sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability. ^ Firstly, the detection sensitivity of LIBS is element dependent and the limits of detection (LODs) for some elements are very poor. Due to the quick expansion and fast motion of the laser-induced plasmas, the lifetime of laser-induced plasmas is very short (typically microseconds). Secondly, the interference effects limit the LIBS detection selectivity and reliability. The LIBS spectra for most elements are very complex and sometimes false identifications may be made because emission lines from many elements overlap with each other in wavelength. Finally, the matrix effects also limit the LIBS detection sensitivity and reliability since the emission intensity from the target element depends on not only the concentration, but also the chemical and physical properties of the matrix. ^ In this dissertation, a novel technique to improve the LIBS detection sensitivity based on spatially-confined LIBS will be introduced, which is simple and economic. This approach can improve the detection sensitivity by a factor of 10. LIBS combined with laser-induced fluorescence (LIBS-LIF) has been studied to demonstrate the capability of LIBS in trace element detection. The detection sensitivity can be improved by a factor of 50. During the cooling process of the laser-induced plasmas, the transient radicals will be formed and the Raman spectra of the radicals have been studied. By combining Raman spectroscopy of <b>overcooled</b> laser-induced plasmas with LIBS, the detection reliability will be further improved. The potential to detect isotopes using Raman spectroscopy of <b>overcooled</b> laser-induced plasmas will also be discussed. ^ In summary, the spatial confinement of plasmas in LIBS can improve the LIBS detection sensitivity; LIBS-LIF can improve both the LIBS detection sensitivity and selectivity; and Raman spectroscopy of <b>overcooled</b> laser-induced plasmas can improve the LIBS reliability. By integrating all these benefits into one single system, an ultrasensitive, selective and highly accurate trace element detection approach has been developed. ...|$|R

With increasing the random fields in the system, a first-order phase transition is transformed into a second-order phase transition, and furthermore, a second-order phase transition is inhibited. However, proper random fields can promote the spontaneous appearance of a first-order phase transition by increasing the <b>overcooled</b> temperature.

30|$|Next, we can {{exclude the}} {{possibility}} of solvent freezing-point depression by addition of the NPs [12]. The estimated freezing-point depression of the dispersion prepared by adding CdSe/ZnS NPs at the concentration used here is about 10 - 4 K. It should be noticed that all measurements are carried out at elevating temperature. One {{of the reasons for}} this is that the freezing temperature shows hysteresis, which is observed in our experiment, and can be <b>overcooled</b> by decreasing temperature. Another reason is difficulties related to controlling of liquid helium flow in the cryostat with the temperature controller. Also, all features in PL measurements are reproducible.|$|R
50|$|In a batch reactor, good {{temperature}} control is achieved {{when the heat}} added or removed by the heat exchange surface (qx) equals the heat generated or absorbed by the process material (qp). For flowing reactors made up of tubes or plates, satisfying the relationship qx = qp does not deliver good {{temperature control}} since the rate of process heat liberation/absorption varies at different points within the reactor. Controlling the outlet temperature does not prevent hot/cold spots within the reactor. Hot or cold spots caused by exothermic or endothermic activity can be eliminated by relocating the temperature sensor (T) {{to the point where}} the hot/cold spots exists. This however leads to overheating or <b>overcooling</b> downstream of the temperature sensor.|$|E
50|$|High mountainous moraines, {{as well as}} {{outcrops}} of bedrock {{surrounded by}} alpine grasslands, are being utilized as the main habitat by this snake. Deposits of rocks provide snakes with deep hibernation dens, but also serve as daily shelters and protection from overheating and/or <b>overcooling</b> {{as well as from}} predators. Also rocky deposits support important food resources: rock lizards (mainly Darevskia valentini) and small rodents (Microtus ssp.). Darevsky's vipers are diurnal snakes, and during the day they often move inside the rocky deposits to maintain optimal body temperature, which is about 26-28 °C (79-82 °F). Very little is known about natural enemies of this viper. Remains of this snake were found in the feces of a beech marten (Martes foina nehringi).|$|E
50|$|Conditions {{within a}} {{continuous}} reactor {{change as the}} product passes along the flow channel. In an ideal reactor {{the design of the}} flow channel is optimised to cope with this change. In practice, this is achieved by breaking the reactor into a series of stages. Within each stage the ideal heat transfer conditions can be achieved by varying the surface to volume ratio or the cooling/heating flux. Thus stages where process heat output is very high either use extreme heat transfer fluid temperatures or have high surface to volume ratios (or both). By tackling the problem as a series of stages, extreme cooling/heating conditions to be employed at the hot/cold spots without suffering overheating or <b>overcooling</b> elsewhere. The significance of this is that larger flow channels can be used. Larger flow channels are generally desirable as they permit higher rate, lower pressure drop and a reduced tendency to block.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{heat pipes}} are {{constant}} conductance devices, where the heat pipe operating temperature is {{set by the}} source and sink temperatures, the thermal resistances from the source to the heat pipe, and the thermal resistances from the heat pipe to the sink. In these heat pipes, the temperature drops linearly as the power or condenser temperature is reduced. For some applications, such as satellite or research balloon thermal control, the electronics will be <b>overcooled</b> at low powers, or at the low sink temperatures. Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) are used to passively maintain {{the temperature of the}} electronics being cooled as power and sink conditions change.|$|R

30|$|Among these {{flexible}} loads, HVAC draws {{most attention}} and is normally considered flexible for two reasons. First, minor temperature changes in customers’ buildings may not adversely impact human comfort [36]. Then, heat {{can be stored}} in buildings because of building thermal insulation, which further enables buildings to “store” electricity. That is, buildings can be overheated or <b>overcooled</b> when electricity prices are low, so HVAC devices can be turned off when electricity prices go up. In the work of [20, 37, 38, 39], HVAC loads are scheduled to minimize consumer electricity bills. These studies capture the thermodynamics of buildings and temperature constraints set by consumers. It is shown that the HVAC control scheme has a dramatic effect on both system-wide peak load and consumer electricity bills.|$|R
50|$|While the {{thermostat}} is closed, {{there is no}} flow of coolant in the radiator loop, and coolant water is instead redirected through the engine, allowing it to warm up rapidly while also avoiding hot spots. The thermostat stays closed until the coolant temperature reaches the nominal thermostat opening temperature. The thermostat then progressively opens as the coolant temperature increases to the optimum operating temperature, increasing the coolant flow to the radiator. Once the optimum operating temperature is reached, {{the thermostat}} progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range as engine heat output, vehicle speed, and outside ambient temperature change. Under normal operating conditions the thermostat is open to about half of its stroke travel, {{so that it can}} open further or reduce its opening to react to changes in operating conditions. A correctly designed thermostat will never be fully open or fully closed while the engine is operating normally, or overheating or <b>overcooling</b> would occur.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the <b>overcooling</b> problem and propose some possible solutions. We {{show that the}} <b>overcooling</b> problem is generic to the hierarchical picture of structure formation, {{as long as the}} cooling is actually possible in small halos at high redshift. Solutions to this problem are likely to be associated with some feedback mechanism, and probably imply the existence of a warm IGM containing most of the cosmological baryons. We concentrate on some possible solutions, mainly photoionization and bulk-heating of the IGM. We show photoionization can act as a significant feedback mechanism but is not strong enough to solve the entire <b>overcooling</b> problem. We therefore assume that the IGM is maintained hot by some energy injection provided by supernova and galaxy formation is then limited by this feedback mechanism.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of cooling in {{radiative}} shocks simulated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and adaptive mesh refinement codes. We obtain a similarity solution for a shock-tube problem {{in the presence of}} radiative cooling, and test how well the solution is reproduced in Gadget and Flash. Shock broadening governed by the details of the numerical scheme (artificial viscosity or Riemann solvers) leads to potentially significant <b>overcooling</b> in both codes. We interpret our findings in terms of a resolution criterion, and apply it to realistic simulations of cosmological accretion shocks onto galaxy haloes, cold accretion and thermal feedback from supernovae or active galactic nuclei. To avoid numerical <b>overcooling</b> of accretion shocks onto haloes that should develop a hot corona requires a particle or cell mass resolution of 10 ^ 6 M_sun, which is within reach of current state-of-the-art simulations. At this mass resolution, thermal feedback in the interstellar medium of a galaxy requires temperatures of supernova or AGN driven bubbles to be in excess of 10 ^ 7 K at densities of n_H= 1. 0 cm^- 3, in order to avoid spurious suppression of the feedback by numerical <b>overcooling.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, accepted into MNRA...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{believed that a}} critical wet-ting transition must occur when two superconductors characterized by different critical temperatures are brought into contact: as the critical magnetic field strength is approached, the proximity-induced super-conducting layer gradually expands into {{the bulk of the}} weaker superconductor [1].

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} effects of {{radiative}} cooling, star formation and stellar feedback on the properties and evolution of galaxy clusters using high-resolution Adaptive Mesh Refinement N-body+gasdynamics simulations of clusters forming in the ΛCDM universe. Cooling leads to the condensation of gas in the inner regions of clusters, which in turn leads to steepening of the dark matter profile. The cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from the outer regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the cluster core. The magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the current simulations because they suffer from the <b>overcooling</b> problem: a much larger fraction of baryons {{is in the form of}} cold gas and stars than is observed. We find that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem. Additional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simple uniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delays the bulk of star formation until z < 1. Our analysis shows that the <b>overcooling</b> in a cluster as a whole is really the <b>overcooling</b> in the central galaxy and its progenitors at high redshifts. This indicates that an additional heating mechanism that can continuously heat the gas in the cluster core is required to reproduce the observed cluster properties.
