5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications.

Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
