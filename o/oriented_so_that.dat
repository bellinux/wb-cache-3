5|$|The extant folios of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise {{the doctrine of the}} four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E
5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, {{with the central}} bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E

30|$|The {{calibration}} {{was performed}} by putting small weights directly on the target surface. For this purpose, the cantilever and the target were <b>oriented</b> horizontally, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the weights acted roughly in direction of the surface normal.|$|R
30|$|An {{oriented}} {{wheel is}} a graph g s.t. {{for a certain}} permutation of the set of nodes, they form a strictly oriented path whose extremes are also connected by an <b>oriented</b> link, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> any two nodes are connected by a strictly oriented path, and no other link exists.|$|R
25|$|The {{router table}} is usually <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the router bit is {{vertical}} {{and the table}} over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This is an alternative for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.|$|E
25|$|When {{the flag}} is {{affixed to the}} right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any {{physical}} object that moves), it should be <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{for this}} method include the {{identification}} of lattice defects in crystals. By carefully selecting {{the orientation of the}} sample, it is possible not just to determine the position of defects but also to determine the type of defect present. If the sample is <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> one particular plane is only slightly tilted away from the strongest diffracting angle (known as the Bragg Angle), any distortion of the crystal plane that locally tilts the plane to the Bragg angle will produce particularly strong contrast variations. However, defects that produce only displacement of atoms that do not tilt the crystal to the Bragg angle (i. e. displacements parallel to the crystal plane) will not produce strong contrast.|$|E
50|$|The church {{building}} is a stone one-story structure with steeply pitched gabled roof and flared overhanging eaves. It is <b>oriented</b> northeast-southwest <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the chancel faces Jerusalem. A crenellated stone tower {{is located on the}} north corner. A parish room and sacristy are located in the extensions along Church Street from the western corner.|$|R
50|$|In orbit, a {{spacecraft}} with one axis {{much longer than}} the other two will spontaneously <b>orient</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> its long axis points at the planet's center of mass. This system has the virtue of needing no active control system or expenditure of fuel. The effect is caused by a tidal force. The upper end of the vehicle feels less gravitational pull than the lower end. This provides a restoring torque whenever the long axis is not co-linear with the direction of gravity. Unless some means of damping is provided, the spacecraft will oscillate about the local vertical. Sometimes tethers are used to connect two parts of a satellite, to increase the stabilizing torque. A problem with such tethers is that meteoroids as small as a grain of sand can part them.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Grace A. de Laguna's [...] "The Role of Teleonomy in Evolution" [...] {{attempted}} {{to show how}} different stages of evolution were characterized by different types of teleonomy. de Laguna points out that humans have <b>oriented</b> teleonomy <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the teleonomic goal is not restricted to the reproduction of humans, but also to cultural ideals.|$|R
25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E
500|$|As seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, the {{observer}} {{has a direct}} view of mirror M1 seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image M'2 of mirror M2. The fringes {{can be interpreted as}} the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images S'1 and S'2 of the original source S. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend {{on the nature of the}} light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig.2a, the optical elements are <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> S'1 and S'2 are in line with {{the observer}}, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to M1 and M'2. If, as in Fig.2b, M1 and M'2 are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if M1 and M'2 overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced. [...] If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig.2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of Fig.2b will be localized on the mirrors.|$|E
500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E

2500|$|Mounds {{range from}} small to large, {{measuring}} [...] in height and [...] in diameter with no visible entrances. Workers are {{only able to}} access their nests {{by a series of}} subterranean tunnels that protrude from the central region. Constructed from soil, mounds are <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the long portions of the mound face toward the sun during the early morning and before sunset. Mounds are usually oval-shaped with the long axis of the nest orientating itself in a north-south direction. These ants also spend large amounts of energy in nest construction and transporting brood, which is related with thermoregulation. The brood is transported to areas where temperatures are high; workers track temperature patterns of the mound and do not rely on behavioural habits. Inside nests, mounds contain a series of narrow horizontal tunnels, with subterranean shafts and nodes reaching grass roots [...] below the surface; these shafts and nodes connect the mound tunnels to the subterranean chambers. These chambers are about 5cm2 (0.77 inch2) and reach depths of [...] The mean number of ants in a single subterranean chamber is around 200.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{hand-held}} protractor compass {{always has}} an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator {{inscribed on the}} baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or {{to ensure that the}} object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the magnetic bearing to the target. Again, if one is using [...] "true" [...] or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the magnetic bearing into a true bearing. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.|$|E

2500|$|The form of Agrippa's Pantheon is debated. As {{a result}} of {{excavations}} in the late 19th century, archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani concluded that Agrippa's Pantheon was <b>oriented</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it faced South, {{in contrast with the}} current layout that faces North, and that it had a shortened T-shaped plan with the entrance {{at the base of the}} [...] "T". This description was widely accepted until the late 20th century. While more recent archaeological diggings have suggested that Agrippa's building might have had a circular form with a triangular porch, and it might have also faced North, much like the later rebuildings, Ziolkowski complains that their conclusions were based entirely on surmise; according to him, they did not find any new datable material, yet they attributed everything they found to the Agrippan phase, failing to account for the fact that Domitian, known for his enthusiasm for building and known to have restored the Pantheon after 80 AD, might well have been responsible for everything they found. Ziolkowski argues that Lanciani's initial assessment is still supported by all of the finds to date, including theirs; furthermore he expresses skepticism because the building they describe, [...] "a single building composed of a huge pronaos and a circular cella of the same diameter, linked by a relatively narrow and very short passage (much thinner than the current intermediate block), has no known parallels in classical architecture and would go against everything we know of Roman design principles in general and of Augustan architecture in particular." ...|$|E

5000|$|When he made {{landfall}} on {{the tiny}} island of San Salvador in 1492, Columbus thought he had reached the East Indies. This was precisely his quest- to find an all-water route to the <b>orient</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> European traders, who traded precious spices, could avoid paying tribute to the Middle Eastern middlemen who skimmed profits off overland trading ventures. The island was called Guanahani by the Natives of the island, and the name was promptly changed following Spanish colonization. In the 17th century, San Salvador was settled by an English Buccaneer, John Watling (alternately referred to as George Watling), who gave the island its alternative historical name. The United Kingdom gained control of what are now the Bahamas in the early 18th century. In 1925 the name [...] "San Salvador" [...] was officially transferred from another place, now called Cat Island, and given to [...] "Watlings Island," [...] based on historians believing this was a more likely match for Columbus' description of Guanahani.
