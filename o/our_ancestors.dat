5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Among {{all kinds}} of apes, only gibbons have the slim body as human. Gibbons can move in the forest by cross arm swing, what was the {{locomotion}} mode of <b>our</b> arboreal <b>ancestor.</b> Since <b>our</b> <b>ancestor</b> had much heavier body but weaker arms than gibbons, we suppose they had to move with two arm brachiation. Such mode of locomotion can account reasonably for the transition to bipedalism. Firstly, it needed <b>our</b> <b>ancestor</b> to straighten knee and hip joints and flex their lumbar spine. secondly, it evolved the feet of <b>our</b> <b>ancestor</b> with longitudinal arche. And most importantly, it made {{the ratio of the}} length of the upper limbs to that of the lower limbs unsuitable for quadruped walking. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|Most {{scholars}} today {{consider all}} such theories {{not so much}} wrong— they occasionally offer peripheral insights— as comically naïve and irrelevant.

25|$|These men, {{whom you}} see {{slaughtered}} on the ground, were neither Pagans nor Mahometans, at whose death we should rejoice—they were Christians, lately your subjects and your countrymen, {{some of them}} your relations.

25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships {{as more of a}} priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London researchers say it’s evolutionary and we can blame <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> for this.|$|E

25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of <b>our</b> <b>ancestors.</b> These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshed“, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, {{and go back to}} where you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> and for the welfare of our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{of these}} ideas on current {{thinking}} on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure not to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might {{prove to be a}} fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.|$|E

25|$|If, therefore, in the {{following}} pages I fall into any errors, I hope they will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place {{at a time when}} the Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres , and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. <b>Our</b> <b>ancestors</b> were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.|$|E
25|$|Von Däniken {{was born}} in Zofingen, Aargau. Brought up as a Roman Catholic, he {{attended}} the Saint-Michel International Catholic School in Fribourg, Switzerland. During his time at the school he rejected the church's interpretations of the Bible and developed an interest in astronomy and the phenomenon of flying saucers. At the age of 19, {{he was given a}} four-month suspended sentence for theft. He left the school and was apprenticed to a Swiss hotelier for a time, before moving to Egypt. In December 1964, von Däniken wrote Hatten unsere Vorfahren Besuch aus dem Weltraum? ("Did <b>our</b> <b>Ancestors</b> have a Visit from Space?") for the German-Canadian periodical Der Nordwesten. While in Egypt, he was involved in a jewelry deal which resulted in a nine-month conviction for fraud and embezzlement upon his return to Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment {{in accordance with the}} custom of <b>our</b> <b>ancestors)</b> consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.|$|E

25|$|And so {{with the}} Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital matter of taxation. They are in a {{minority}} in Congress. Their representation in Congress, is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they are taxed {{by the people of}} the North for their benefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> in the British parliament for their benefit. For the last forty years, the taxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of the North. The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue to promote, by prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.|$|E
