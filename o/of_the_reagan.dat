5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election marked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in {{at the age of}} 70.|$|E

5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> CSG {{performed}} {{humanitarian assistance}} and disaster relief {{operations in the}} Philippines on 24 June 2008 after that country was devastated by Typhoon Fengshen, killing hundreds from the central island regions and <b>the</b> main island <b>of</b> Luzon. <b>The</b> typhoon also capsized the passenger ferry MV Princess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stars. Working in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armed Forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, <b>Reagan</b> and her escorts of CSG 7 focused their efforts on <b>the</b> island <b>of</b> Panay in <b>the</b> Central Visayas. For eight days, SH-60 Seahawk helicopters and C-2A Greyhound aircraft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> CSG helped deliver more than [...] of rice, fresh water, and other supplies to areas of Panay, which were not reachable by truck due to flooded roads. The mission in Panay earned the entire strike group the Navy's Humanitarian Service Medal.|$|R

25|$|On 4 January 1982, Reagan {{signed the}} top secret National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17), giving the CIA the {{authority}} to recruit and support the contras with $19 million in military aid.

50|$|Carol McCain {{moved to}} La Mesa, California, {{where she lived}} for several months with <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> top <b>Reagan</b> {{associate}} Edwin Meese.

25|$|The EPA {{published}} the first Hazard Ranking System (HRS) in 1981, {{and the first}} National Priorities List (NPL) in 1983. Implementation during early years, the two terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration was ineffective, as only 16 of the 799 Superfund sites were cleaned up, and only $40 million of $700 million in recoverable funds from responsible parties were collected. Reagan's policies were described as laissez-faire.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. the Reagan Era of {{conservative}} national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control {{with the election}} of Ronald Reagan in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of Barack Obama in 2008 represented an end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the Late-2000s recession with prolonged unemployment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{administration}} (1981–1985), Kudlow was associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), {{a part of the}} Executive Office of the President.

25|$|At {{least one}} {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Doctrine technically pre-dated the Reagan Presidency. In Afghanistan, the Carter administration began providing limited covert military assistance to Afghanistan's mujahideen {{in an effort}} to drive the Soviets out of the nation, or at least raise the military and political cost of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The policy of aiding the mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services. It enjoyed broad bipartisan political support.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, President Reagan {{promoted}} Weld to {{head of the}} Criminal Division of the Justice Department in Washington, where Weld oversaw 700 employees.
