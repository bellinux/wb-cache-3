5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and the engine room scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E

25|$|As Cyclops {{lifeboats}} {{were launched}} and got clear, Kersley {{and some of}} his officers remained aboard to ensure that everyone who was still alive had left. 29 minutes after the first attack U-123 fired a second torpedo from one of her stern tubes, which hit Cyclops port side.

25|$|A popular Dairy Queen, {{which had}} been in {{business}} for 54 years, {{was a victim of}} the storm (but it reopened in late September), along with two large car dealerships, and several other businesses along Riverside Drive and Iowa Highway 1. The 134-year-old Saint Patrick's Catholic Church was heavily damaged <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> after Holy Thursday Mass, with most of its roof destroyed. The building was ruled a total loss and has since been demolished. The downtown business district as well as the eastern residential area and several parks suffered scattered damage of varying degrees.|$|E
25|$|By December 1971, the RLAF faced a fresh threat. North Vietnamese attacks {{into the}} Plaine des Jarres were {{supported}} by an air cover of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighters, forcing a temporary withdrawal of the RLAF. However, RLAF T-28s and AC-47s soon returned to action, flying from Long Tieng. Although operating off an airstrip menaced by intruding tanks and under occasional 130mm shell fire, the RLAF continued to strike the enemy. Many of the T-28 bombing sorties flown were <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> in duration, because the enemy was so close. Combat sorties for the year amounted to about 30,000.|$|E
25|$|Dublin Port is {{situated}} {{closer to the}} city centre than Dún Laoghaire Harbour. It operates up to 18 daily sailings to the UK and the continent.

The port also handles about 1.3 million tourists yearly. The port is <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> from Dublin city centre and is accessed by a number of Dublin Bus routes.

25|$|Spurs then faced London rivals West Ham in a scrappy affair. West Ham {{took the}} lead through a Carlton Cole volley, however <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> later, Cole mis-placed a pass {{directly}} {{into the path of}} Jermain Defoe to give Tottenham a way back into the game. Spurs then took all three points when Aaron Lennon cut in from the right to slam the ball past Robert Green late in the game. Three wins out the first three games produced Tottenham's most successful start to a season since the double-winning team of 1961 and left them topping the table after the first three games of the season.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{excitation}} of {{the sample}} with a radio frequency (60–1000MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. A spectrum from a single FID has a low signal-to-noise ratio, but fortunately it improves readily with averaging of repeated acquisitions. Good 1H NMR spectra can be acquired with 16 repeats, which takes <b>only</b> <b>minutes.</b> However, for elements heavier than hydrogen, the relaxation time is rather long, e.g. around 8 seconds for 13C. Thus, acquisition of quantitative heavy-element spectra can be time-consuming, taking tens of minutes to hours.|$|E
25|$|As for Die Walküre, {{the first}} act of this opera {{probably}} gave Wagner more trouble than any other act in the entire tetralogy. In his two prose sketches for it Wotan enters Hunding's house in his guise as Der Wanderer ("The Wanderer") and thrusts the sword into the ash tree, which Siegmund then withdraws <b>only</b> <b>minutes</b> later; the fully worked-out prose draft also brings Wotan onto the stage. It was only at a later stage {{in the evolution of}} the text that Wagner banished the Wanderer and his sword to the backstory which Sieglinde narrates to Siegmund. Now the sword is already embedded in the tree as the curtain goes up on Act 1 and Siegmund's withdrawal of it becomes a climactic piece of dramaturgy.|$|E
