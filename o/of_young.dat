5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study <b>of</b> <b>young</b> people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% <b>of</b> <b>young</b> females, and 22% <b>of</b> <b>young</b> males admitting to self-harm.
