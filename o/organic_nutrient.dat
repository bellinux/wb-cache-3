50|$|Fungal {{growth is}} {{affected}} by the presence of optimal nutrients necessary for growth, by the presence of minerals, by temperature, by pH and by osmotic pressure. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium that C. coronatus finds itself in favors the formation of vegetative germ tubes, with glucose inducing vegetative germ growth far more effectively than asparagine. In terms of necessary nutrients for growth and survival, glucose and trehalose are both good sources of carbon for C. coronatus, other adequate sources of carbon are fructose, mannose, maltose, glycerol, oleate, stearate, palmitate and casamino acids, whereas galactose, starch and glycogen are all poor sources of carbon for C. coronatus. When looking at nitrogen, complex nitrogen sources seem to be best suited for optimal C. coronatus growth, however L-asparagine, ammonium salts, L-aspartic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and urea can all adequately be used by the fungus as nitrogen sources to varying extents. This fungus is unable to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. Certain minerals are able to stimulate fungal growth, for C. coronatus these minerals are Magnesium and Zinc. In terms of temperature effects on fungal growth, the temperature at which C. coronatus growth is at an optimal stage on agar is 27 °C, and the minimum temperature at which it is able to grow on agar is 6 °C. Though there is no growth seen below 6 °C, good survival of C. coronatus has been demonstrated at temperatures of 1 °C. Finally, the maximum growth temperature of C. coronatus on agar is 33 °C, this maximum growth temperature increases to 40 °C when the fungus is grown in liquid culture.In terms of pH effects on C. coronatus, the optimal pH broad range of growth for this fungus is pH 5.5 to pH 7, however sub-optimal growth can occur anywhere within the range of pH 3.5 to pH 8. In terms of pH dependent physiology, there is more frequent production of germ tubes on mildly acidic or neutral media (range of pH 5 to pH 7) with the greatest percent of germination occurring at pH 5. In addition, the percentage of spores that produce secondary spores is far greater on acidic media than on both neutral and basic media. In addition to <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> and mineral presence, temperature and pH, osmotic pressure also has an effect on C. coronatus growth and dispersal. The spores of this fungus are more likely to germinate at lower osmotic pressures, and any medium with osmotic pressures greater than 10 atm will almost entirely inhibit germination of this fungus.|$|E

Over the range conditions tested, this strain of V. cholerae showed maximum response as determined by increased plate counts and direct microscopic counts in microcosms prepared with a chemically defined sea salts solution at a salinity of 25 %, but with lower or higher salinity levels, the maximum population size declined. When added organic concentrations of less than 1, 000 micrograms/liter were present, a marked salinity effect on the growth of V. cholerae was detected. However, at or above an <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentration of 1, 000 micrograms/liter, {{the need for an}} optimum salinity level was spared.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the internal stoichiometry of a temperate latitude shelf sea system is presented which reveals strong vertical and horizontal gradients in dissolved nutrient and particulate concentrations and in the elemental stoichiometry of those pools. Such gradients have implications for carbon and nutrient export from coastal waters to the open ocean. The mixed layer inorganic nutrient stoichiometry shifted from balanced N:P in winter, to elevated N:P in spring and to depleted N:P in summer, relative to the Redfield ratio. This pattern suggests increased likelihood of P limitation of fast growing phytoplankton species in spring and of N limitation of slower growing species in summer. However, as only silicate concentrations were below potentially limiting concentrations during summer and autumn the stoichiometric shifts in inorganic nutrient N:P are considered due to phytoplankton nutrient preference patterns rather than nutrient exhaustion. Elevated particulate stoichiometries corroborate non-Redfield optima underlying organic matter synthesis and nutrient uptake. Seasonal variation in the stoichiometry of the inorganic and <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> pools has the potential to influence the efficiency of nutrient export. In summer, when <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations were at their highest and inorganic nutrient concentrations were at their lowest, the <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> pool was comparatively C poor whilst the inorganic nutrient pool was comparatively C rich. The cross-shelf export of these pools at this time would be associated with different efficiencies regardless of the total magnitude of exchange. In autumn the elemental stoichiometries increased with depth in all pools revealing widespread carbon enrichment of shelf bottom waters with P more intensely recycled than N, N more intensely recycled than C, and Si weakly remineralized relative to C. Offshelf carbon fluxes were most efficient via the inorganic nutrient pool, intermediate for the <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> pool and least efficient for the particulate pool. N loss from the shelf however was most efficient via the dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> pool. Mass balance calculations suggest that 28 % of PO 43 −, 34 % of NO 3 − and 73 % of Si drawdown from the mixed layer fails to reappear in the benthic water column thereby indicating the proportion of the nutrient pools that must be resupplied from the ocean each year to maintain shelf wide productivity. Loss to the neighbouring ocean, the sediments, transference to the dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> pool and higher trophic levels are considered the most likely fate for these missing nutrients...|$|E

Here we assessed, in the laboratory, the growth rate and nutrient uptake responses of U. prolifera to different nutrient treatments.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} marine phytoplankton (especially coccolithophores) to utilize organic nutrients {{and the influence of}} CO 2 -induced changes of environmental conditions like a decreased ratio of inorganic to organic nutrients on a phytoplankton community. A North Atlantic phytoplankton assemblage showed no effect on the composition of the assemblage under a changed ratio of inorganic to organic nutrients, but some diatom genera preferred inorganic or organic nutrients. The ability of genera to utilize organic nutrients indicates a competitive advantage of these genera compared to inorganic nutrient preferring genera when organic nutrients are available. Three coccolithophores were grown on seven different <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> compounds to investigate if the utilization of <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> compounds is species-specific. All three coccolithophores were able to utilize a range of different organic nutrients, but two species did not grow on some organic nutrients. This disability could indicate their dependence on nitrate and phosphate and lead to a competitive advantage over other species which are able to utilize these organic nutrients. The results of this thesis are a further step to understand the utilizability and importance of organic nutrients in the ocean. Species which are not able to utilize organic nutrients may be nitrogen or phosphorus limited under a decreased inorganic to <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> ratio. These limitations may affect silicification and calcification and therefore change biogeochemical cycles...|$|E

Efficient utilization of organic P sources in agriculture will help to preserve P resources and thereby {{has the potential to}} close nutrient cycles and prevent unwanted P-losses to the environment, one of the major causes for eutrophication of water bodies. Unfortunately, organic P sources usually contain also various detrimental substances, such as potentially toxic elements or organic contaminants like pharmaceuticals as well as pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, the utilization of some of these substrates such as sewage sludge or animal by-products is legally limited in agriculture because of the potential risk to contaminate sites with potentially toxic elements and organic contaminants.

The {{influence of}} biodegradable <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> load on biofouling was investigated at varying (i) crossflow velocity, (ii) nutrient concentration, (iii) shear, and (iv) feed spacer thickness. Experimental studies were performed with membrane fouling simulators (MFSs) containing a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane and a 31 mil thick feed spacer, commonly applied in practice in RO and nanofiltration (NF) spiral-wound membrane modules. Numerical modeling studies were done with identical feed spacer geometry differing in thickness (28, 31 and 34 mil). Additionally, experiments were done applying a forward osmosis (FO) membrane with varying spacer thickness (28, 31 and 34 mil), addressing the permeate flux decline and biofilm development. Assessed were the development of feed channel pressure drop (MFS studies), permeate flux (FO studies) and accumulated biomass amount measured by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and total organic carbon (TOC). Our studies showed that the <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> load determined the accumulated amount of biomass. The same amount of accumulated biomass was found at constant nutrient load irrespective of linear flow velocity, shear, and/or feed spacer thickness. The impact of the same amount of accumulated biomass on feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux was influenced by membrane process design and operational conditions. Reducing the nutrient load by pretreatment slowed-down the biofilm formation. The impact of accumulated biomass on membrane performance was reduced by applying a lower crossflow velocity and/or a thicker and/or a modified geometry feed spacer.

According to Ghotaslou and Behnaz (2013), oxygen depletion of 0 to 1 % (<[*] 3  mg/l) could lead to stress in P. aeruginosa affecting its antibiotics sensitivity. These authors revealed that changes in oxygen pressure contributed to increased antibiotic resistance in hypoxia (1 %) with penicillin, tobramycin and carbapenem drugs, while the inhibition diameter values in normoxia 21 % (5 – 7  mg/l) remained unchanged. During the sampling campaign, the concentrations of dissolved organic matters obtained were different to those of oligotrophic groundwaters (<[*] 1  mg/l) where <b>organic</b> <b>nutrient</b> limitation leads to nutrient stress against bacteria.
