5|$|In the 2006-2007 school year, 964 {{students}} attended North. North's minority enrollment {{has grown}} in {{the last twenty years}} despite attempts to keep it low. In 1987 North's minority enrollment was 46%. Minority enrollment continued to grow, becoming over 60% in 1991. Today, only three percent of students are white, with the majority of students, 69%, being black. Currently, 82% of students qualify for free or reduced priced lunch, an indicator of poverty. 16% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> limited English proficiency and 22% of students qualified for special education.|$|E
5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, {{his father had been}} suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E

A few days later 40 {{boarders}} occupied the quarters {{to the west of}} the building. There were then 540 students in 14 classes. About one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> a European (mostly Portuguese) connection.|$|E

25|$|A major {{challenge}} for medical training programs is recruitment of GTAs and MUTAs. It {{is not easy}} to find potential teaching assistants who are healthy, are capable of instructing students well, and are comfortable with having their breasts or genital areas palpated by medical students. A 2016 survey of Canadian medical schools found that only 65% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> performed a urogenital examination on a patient during their introductory clinical skills sessions.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of brigadier commander Wu Yunping of the 44th Airborne Brigade, troops advanced on the Monument and at about 4:40 am, shot out the students' loud speakers. By then, the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> been persuaded by Liu Xiaobo, Hou Dejian to leave the Square. The students left the Square to the southeast. Some were beaten by soldiers along the way. Army vehicles then ran over the tent city. By 5:30 am the Square was cleared. Debris was lifted out by helicopter.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} two shootings, Harris removed his trench coat and aimed his 9mm carbine down the west {{staircase}} toward three youths: 15-year-olds Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves and 16-year-old Lance Kirklin. The three friends had been ascending the staircase directly below the shooters. Kirklin later reported seeing Klebold and Harris standing {{at the top of}} the staircase before the pair opened fire. All three youths were shot and wounded. Inside the school, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> believed that they were bearing witness to a senior prank by the two seniors. But in the cafeteria, Dave Sanders, a computer and business teacher as well as a varsity coach, quickly realized it was not a prank but a deliberate attack on the school.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} was renewed in 2008, when {{several members of}} the graduating class stole the statue from its secure location on campus. Despite rumors that the statue was locked in the college's military bunker, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> seen the statue returned to the basement of a college dormitory after the reunion festivities of 2007. In late April 2008, the students staged a fake poker game {{in the basement of the}} dormitory; while two kept a lookout at the building's entrances, a third picked the lock to the basement storage room, and a fourth student backed a getaway car up to the dorm's loading dock. The heist was completed in under 20 minutes, and the statue was promptly transported to Vassar College, where it was left in the dorm room of a student's girlfriend.|$|E

In 2001, at Field, 42% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> limited English proficiency, and 94% of the students received free or reduced lunch.

Washington joined other groups of students not permitted to enroll in other local colleges. Local estimates placed the student population of Roosevelt College at about 1/8black and 1/2Jewish. A full 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> enrolled because of the [...] "nondiscriminatory progressive principles."

40|$|Background: Role {{of youngsters}} in {{voluntary}} blood donation {{is crucial to}} meet <b>the</b> demand <b>of</b> safe blood. Therefore understanding the various factors contributing to knowledge, attitude and practice of voluntary blood donation (VBD) among youngsters is important. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} assess <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> knowledge, attitude and practice regarding blood donation among the health care medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 students in second MBBS in a tertiary care teaching Hospital in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, using a structured survey questionnaire. Results: The present study shows majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>students</b> <b>have</b> very good knowledge and attitude towards blood donation. Compared to knowledge and attitude, the practice is good and 66 % of responses were above average. Majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> an intention to donate blood and 46 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> donated blood. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> positive attitude towards blood donation, even the reason for non-donation is just not getting opportunity for donation. The non-donors showed positive attitude by expressing their willingness to donate blood if they were asked to donate blood. Conclusions: The present study shows second MBBS <b>students</b> participated in <b>the</b> study has adequate knowledge and attitude. <b>The</b> practice <b>of</b> blood donation is also good and further can be improved by educational programmes.

60|$|It {{was growing}} dark {{when they reached}} the college grounds and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> gone in to supper. Tom said he did not feel much like eating, but his brother told him he had better have a little food, and they went in together. They saw Songbird and the others at another table. The would-be poet and Spud nodded to them, but Stanley paid no attention.|$|E
60|$|Bright {{and early}} the next morning the cadets {{assembled}} for their last breakfast in the mess-room. The parade was dispensed with, for some had to leave by the early boat on the lake {{in order to make the}} proper connections. Many were the handshakings and the kind words of farewell. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> graduated and were not to come back. Of these a few were bound for college, while others were going into various lines of business.|$|E
60|$|He slept very badly. The {{next day}} was Sunday, and he worked at his biology. He sat with the book in front of him, forming the words with his lips in order to fix his attention, but he could {{remember}} nothing. He found his thoughts going back to Mildred every minute, and he repeated to himself the exact words of the quarrel they had had. He had to force himself back to his book. He {{went out for a}} walk. The streets on the South side of the river were dingy enough on week-days, but there was an energy, a coming and going, which gave them a sordid vivacity; but on Sundays, with no shops open, no carts in the roadway, silent and depressed, they were indescribably dreary. Philip thought that day would never end. But he was so tired that he slept heavily, and when Monday came he entered upon life with determination. Christmas was approaching, and a good many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> gone into the country for the short holiday between the two parts of the winter session; but Philip had refused his uncle's invitation to go down to Blackstable. He had given the approaching examination as his excuse, but in point of fact he had been unwilling to leave London and Mildred. He had neglected his work so much that now he had only a fortnight to learn what the curriculum allowed three months for. He set to work seriously. He found it easier each day not to think of Mildred. He congratulated himself on his force of character. The pain he suffered was no longer anguish, but a sort of soreness, like what one might be expected to feel if one had been thrown off a horse and, though no bones were broken, were bruised all over and shaken. Philip found {{that he was able to}} observe with curiosity the condition he had been in during the last few weeks. He analysed his feelings with interest. He was a little amused at himself. One thing that struck him was how little under those circumstances it mattered what one thought; the system of personal philosophy, which had given him great satisfaction to devise, had not served him. He was puzzled by this.|$|E
