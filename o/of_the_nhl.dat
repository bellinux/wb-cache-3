5|$|Although young, Kennedy was {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NHL.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many of Canada's {{top players}} were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) {{pushed for the}} ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NHL</b> season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, {{the trophy}} was donated in 1892, by then Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston, as {{an award for}} Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club.

5|$|The Stanley Cup is {{a trophy}} awarded {{annually}} to the playoff champion club of the National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey league.

Inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy {{as the result of}} challenge games and league play. Professional clubs came to dominate the competition {{in the early years of}} the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) (forerunner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NHL)</b> and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup.
