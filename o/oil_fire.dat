5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|Fusō sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a {{few dozen}} men survived the rapid sinking and <b>oil</b> <b>fire.</b> There is {{evidence}} {{that some of these}} were rescued by the destroyer , which was itself sunk a short time later; {{it is also possible that}} some who escaped the sinking reached Leyte only to be killed by Filipinos, as is known to have happened to survivors from other Japanese warships sunk in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Implacable was recommissioned on 16 January 1952 as the {{flagship}} of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. On 13 February {{she arrived at}} Dover {{to serve as the}} port's guard ship before and after the state funeral of King George VI, to salute royalty and heads of state arriving by sea. After its conclusion, the ship sailed for the western Mediterranean to rendezvous with her sister for exercises. In June the two sisters represented a fast troop convoy being attacked by aircraft during an air defence exercise. They visited Copenhagen in the next month before returning home. Implacable sailed for Gibraltar on 25 September and made a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal before returning to Devonport for a refit. On 16 November she had an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> in her galley that damaged her electrical wiring badly enough to require extending her refit to 20 January 1953. She spent most of February and March in the western Mediterranean together with her sister, participating in exercises before sailing to Southampton for a brief refit.|$|E

This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E

25|$|Kormoran was stationary, and at 18:25, Detmers {{ordered the}} ship to be abandoned, as damage to the raider's engine room had knocked out the {{fire-fighting}} systems, {{and there was no}} way to control or contain the <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> before it reached the magazines or the mine hold. All boats and liferafts were launched by 21:00, and all but one filled: a skeleton crew manned the weapons while the officers prepared to scuttle the ship. Kormoran was abandoned at midnight; the ship sank slowly until the mine hold exploded 30 minutes later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two damaged steel liferafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72 people, one boat with 31 men aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26 sailors. During the evacuation, a rubber liferaft carrying 60 people, mostly wounded, sank without warning; drowning all but three aboard. Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese laundryman.|$|E
500|$|One or two torpedoes, {{possibly}} {{fired by}} the destroyer , hit Fusō amidships on the starboard side at 03:09 on the 25th; she listed to starboard, slowed down, and fell out of formation. Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour, but they specifically mentioned only {{the size of the}} fire on the water, and not any details of the ship. Historian John Toland agreed in 1970 that Fusō had broken in two, but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009, [...] "Fuso was torpedoed, {{and as a result of}} progressive flooding, upended and capsized within forty minutes." [...] She sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a few dozen men survived her rapid descent and massive <b>oil</b> <b>fire,</b> and only ten reached shore.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Golden Lane" [...] ("Dos Bocas-Alamo structure" [...] or The Ridge") {{refers to}} a series of oil fields aligned in an arc onshore and a {{symmetrical}} alignment offshore, forming two sides of a Cretaceous atoll 180km long. The structure was discovered in 1908 by Weetman Pearson's Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company San diego de la Mar No. 1 well, which flowed 2,500 bbl/day. The Golden Lane oil fields penetrate a massive elliptical reef platform, identified as the Sierra del Abra limestone (consisting of reef, backreef and lagoonal facies), which dips southeast. The site for the discovery well was selected due to the presence of petroleum seeps, just as was Edward Laurence Doheny's La Paz No. well in the Ebano-Panuco petroleum district west of Tampico, Tamaulipas, the first Mexican discovery well in 1904. In 1908, the infamous Dos Bocas <b>oil</b> <b>fire</b> occurred after the San Diego de la Mar No. 3 blowout. This was followed by the Potrero del Llano No. 4 well, flowing 100,000 bbl per day during the three months it was out of control. Doheny's Cerro Azul No. 4 well, located by Ezequiel Ordonez, became the largest daily production record holder in 1916 at 260,000 bbl. Geophysical studies, in particular gravimetry, starting in 1920 led to the discovery of the Poza Rica Field in 1932 and Moralillo Field in 1948, on the west flank of the Golden Lane in the Tamabra forereef facies. Refraction seismography surveys started in 1930, augemented in 1948 with reflection seismography, which led to the discovery of the southern extent of the atoll with the Ezequiel Ordonez No. 1 well in 1952 and additional discoveries through 1968. Marine seismic and magnetometer surveys starting in 1957 showed the extent of the atoll offshore and led to the first offshore well, Isla de Lobos No. 1-B, in 1963. The depths of wells are on the order of 500 m onshore and 2000 m offshore.|$|E
6000|$|Mark how {{virtue is}} rewarded! Another of our destroyers {{an hour or}} so {{previously}} had been knocked clean out of action, before she had done anything, by a big shell which gutted a boiler-room and started an <b>oil</b> <b>fire.</b> (That is the drawback to oil.) She crawled out between the battleships till she [...] "reached an area of comparative calm" [...] and repaired damage. She says: [...] "The fire having been dealt with it was found a mat kept the stokehold dry. My only trouble now being lack of speed, I looked round for useful employment, and saw a destroyer in great difficulties, so closed her." [...] That destroyer was our paralytic friend of the intermittent torpedo-tubes, and a grateful ship she was when her crippled sister (but still good for a few knots) offered her a tow, [...] "under very trying conditions with large enemy ships approaching." [...] So the two set off together, Cripple and Paralytic, with heavy shells falling round them, as sociable as a couple of lame hounds. Cripple worked up to 12 knots, and the weather grew vile, and the tow parted. Paralytic, by this time, had raised steam in a boiler or two, and made shift to get along slowly on her own, Cripple hirpling beside her, till Paralytic could not make any more headway in that rising sea, and Cripple had to tow her once more. Once more the tow parted. So they tied Paralytic up rudely and effectively with a cable round her after bollards and gun (presumably because of strained forward bulkheads) and hauled her stern-first, through heavy seas, at continually reduced speeds, doubtful of their position, unable to sound because of the seas, and much pestered by a wind which backed without warning, till, at last, they made land, and turned into the hospital appointed for brave wounded ships. Everybody speaks well of Cripple. Her name crops up in several reports, with such compliments as the men of the sea use when they see good work. She herself speaks well of her Lieutenant, who, as executive officer, [...] "took charge of the fire and towing arrangements in a very creditable manner," [...] and also of Tom Battye and Thomas Kerr, engine-room artificer and stoker petty officer, who [...] "were in the stokehold {{at the time of the}} shell striking, and performed cool and prompt decisive action, although both suffering from shock and slight injuries." ...|$|E
