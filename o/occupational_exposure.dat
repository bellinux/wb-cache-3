5|$|In adults, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> is {{the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in {{facilities}} that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} to what extent <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> may explain socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer incidence after adjusting for smoking and dietary factors. Analyses were based on a subsample of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC study), a prospective cohort. The analyses included 703 incident lung cancer cases among men in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece. The socioeconomic position was measured using the highest level of education. The estimates of relative indices of inequality (RII) were computed with Cox regression models. We first adjusted for smoking (with detailed information on duration and quantity) and dietary factors (fruits and vegetables consumption) and then for <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> The exposure to three carcinogens [asbestos, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ] was analyzed. The <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> explained 14 % of the socioeconomic inequalities remaining after adjustment for smoking and fruits and vegetables consumption. The inequalities remained nevertheless statistically significant. The RII decreased from 1. 87 (95 % CI: 1. 36 - 2. 56) to 1. 75 (1. 27 - 2. 41). The decrease was more pronounced when adjusting for asbestos than for heavy metals or PAH. Analyses by birth cohort suggested an effect of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> among older men, while due to small number of endpoints, no conclusion could be drawn about the role of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> in educational inequalities among younger men. Our study revealed that the impact of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence, rarely studied until now, exists while of modest magnitude...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{cross-infection}} {{risks for}} dentists {{have been well}} recognised, and much has been published regarding the incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to patient body fluids. Less has been reported regarding the risks to dental assistants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to patient body fluids among dental assistants, to assess the rate of reporting of such incidents, and to evaluate the association of various factors with these exposures. METHOD: All 84 dental assistants working at Birmingham Dental Hospital were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire to provide retrospective information regarding the nature and incidence of any <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> they had experienced. RESULTS: An overall response rate of 94 % was achieved. Dental nurses experienced fewer <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> than dental students at the same institution, and reported incidents more frequently. More injuries occurred after the treatment session. Handling local anaesthetic syringes was associated with more injuries, and percutaneous injuries predominated. Trainee nurses had experienced more occupational injuries in the preceding six months than their qualified colleagues. There was no significant association with any of the other factors evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The general incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> among the dental assistants in this survey was low in comparison to dental students at the same institution. A further reduction may be possible by increasing the training of unqualified nurses with particular regard to post-treatment handling of sharp dental instruments and equipment...|$|R

5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to {{contaminated}} {{biological material}} in dental teaching settings can place students {{at higher risk}} of bloodborne infections. Methods This cross sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire culturally adapted to Portuguese language, Brazil. In total, 173 undergraduate dental students {{agreed to participate in}} the study, answered the questionnaire, and filled in the details about their own <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> The association of these factors was analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test using Stata® software. Results High prevalence of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> (40 %) was observed among the participants, and 52 % of the accidents were not reported to the clinical instructor. The most frequent type of accident was related to &# 8220;puncture/cut/abrasion&# 8221; (56 %). Significant correlation was observed between number of exposures and academic year (p= 0. 002), age (p= 0. 012), gender (p= 0. 010), and between number of injuries in the last 6 months and academic year (p= 0. 003). No significant correlation was observed between number of exposures and dominant hand, use of protective eyewear or Hepatitis B vaccination status (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Retrospective {{exposure}} assessment in community-based studies is largely reliant on questionnaire information. Expert assessment {{is often used}} to assess lifetime <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures,</b> but these assessments generally lack transparency and are very time-consuming. We explored the agreement between a rule-based assessment approach and case-by-case expert assessment of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> in a community-based study. Methods: We used data from a case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which parental <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> were originally assigned by expert assessment. Key questions were identified from the completed parent questionnaires and, based on these, rules were written to assign exposure levels to diesel exhaust, pesticides, and solvents. We estimated exposure prevalence separately for fathers and mothers, and used Kappa statistics to assess the agreement between the two {{exposure assessment}} methods. Results: Exposures were assigned to 5829 jobs among 1079 men and 6189 jobs among 1234 women. For both sexes, agreement was good for the two assessment methods of exposure to diesel exhaust at a job level (κ= 0. 70 for men and κ= 0. 71 for women) and at a person level (κ= 0. 74 and κ= 0. 75). The agreement was good to excellent for pesticide exposure among men (κ= 0. 74 for jobs and κ= 0. 84 at a person level) and women (κ= 0. 68 and κ= 0. 71 at a job and person level, respectively). Moderate to good agreement was observed for assessment of solvent exposure, which was better for women than men.
