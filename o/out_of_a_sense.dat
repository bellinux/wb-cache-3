5|$|Voltaire {{depicts the}} worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of Candide is a {{discussion}} of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of El Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of obligation.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may {{have thought it was}} in his own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of paternalism.|$|E
5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E

Although Eden was fluent in French and German and able to converse with the Chinese premier Chou En-lai in French at Geneva in 1954, he preferred to have diplomats present to translate at meetings <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of professionalism, as when he met Hitler in February 1934.|$|E
25|$|The Windsor Report was criticised by liberals (for example, in The Windsor Report: A Liberal Response) for {{seeming to}} take for granted that the actions of New Hampshire and New Westminster—and {{homosexuality}} in general—were wrong.

50|$|Global {{warming and}} its {{consequences}} present new challenges to modern society. Among these is <b>a</b> degree <b>of</b> uncertainty among scientists about how to communicate the dramatic environmental changes that may be in store. For example, in 2007 James Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies published a paper about scientific reticence in Environmental Research Letters, an on-line science journal open to the public. He proposed that normally quite articulate scientists become reluctant to communicate the full threat of potentially large and damaging future sea-level rise <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misplaced <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> scientific conservatism.|$|R

On these recommendations, King recruited St. Laurent to his World War II cabinet as Minister of Justice, Lapointe's old post, on 9 December. St. Laurent agreed to go to Ottawa <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of duty, but only on the understanding that his foray into politics was temporary and that he would return to Quebec {{at the conclusion of the}} war.

25|$|Paulus {{was convicted}} and given a 35-year sentence. Robinson claimed that Paulus had loved his {{daughter}} and that her actions were born <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of justice for avenging Robinson Hill's death. He continued to maintain his own innocence. Paulus subsequently appealed, and in October 1981, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, ruling {{that there was not}} enough evidence to prove Paulus's guilt, and that McKittrick's evidence was unreliable. This decision was then overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in May 1982, reinstating the conviction and the original sentence. Paulus died of breast cancer at the Gatesville prison on May 16, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss began thorough, active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided that her linguistic abilities were sufficient to yield usable results. Linguists designed their tests to measure both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology. They also continued to observe her in everyday conversations to gauge what pragmatics of language she acquired. The research team considered her language acquisition to be {{a substantial part of}} their larger goal of helping her to integrate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could learn on her own, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of obligation they sometimes stepped in to assist her.|$|E

5000|$|English {{literary}} modernism {{developed in}} the early twentieth-century <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> disillusionment with Victorian era attitudes of certainty, conservatism, and belief {{in the idea of}} objective truth. The movement was influenced by the ideas of Charles Darwin (1809-82), Ernst Mach (1838-1916), Henri Bergson (1859-1941), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), James G. Frazer (1854-1941), Karl Marx (1818-83) (Das Kapital, 1867), and the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), among others. The continental art movements of Impressionism, and later Cubism, were also important. Important literary precursors of modernism, were: Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-81) ( [...] Walt Whitman (1819-92); Charles Baudelaire (1821-67); Rimbaud (1854-91); August Strindberg (1849-1912).|$|R

On October 24, he was given command of XIV Corps (which, because he was also given command of the Department of the Cumberland, would soon be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), {{replacing}} the ineffectual Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who had just fought the inconclusive Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, against Gen. Braxton Bragg, but was accused of moving too cautiously. Rosecrans was promoted to the rank of major general (of volunteers, as opposed to his brigadier rank in the regular army). The promotion was applied retroactive to March 21, 1862, so that he would outrank fellow Maj. Gen. Thomas; Thomas had earlier been offered Buell's command, but turned down the opportunity <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of personal loyalty. Grant was not unhappy that Rosecrans was leaving his command.|$|E
25|$|Though Senna's consistency, the car's {{competitiveness}} and the Williams's unreliability {{at the beginning}} of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the car before it was too late. These modifications enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season. Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of loyalty.|$|E

25|$|Like other {{immigrant}} groups, Filipino immigrants clustered together both <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of community}} {{and in response to}} prejudice against them.

Between 1965 and 1985, more than 400,000 Filipinos immigrated to the United States. In 1970, immigrants made up more than half (53 percent) of all Filipino Americans. In 1980, Filipino Americans were the largest group of Asian Americans in the entire United States; half a million of the Filipino American population were Filipino immigrants, making up 3.6 percent of all immigrants in the United States, outnumbering United States-born Filipino Americans two to one. In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s {{more than half a million}} Filipinos obtained legal permanent resident status in the United States during each decade. In 1992, the U.S. Navy ended the Philippines Enlistment Program due to the end of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement; the program allowed about thirty-five thousand Filipinos to join the U.S. Navy, many of whom immigrated to the United States. Filipino Americans trended to settle in major metropolitan areas, and in the West. Filipino Americans had a tendency to settle in a more dispersed fashion, and to intermarry more than other Asian Americans.|$|E
