The present study aimed at determining the growth pattern and velocity in impoverished children between the age of 2 - 11 years, [n= 360], from an urban Indian slum through anthropometric measurements <b>over</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> duration. The mode of data collection was longitudinal wherein every six months all anthropometric measurements were recorded on all subjects. Initial data showed that 20, 29 and 59 % of children had normal weight, height and weight/height ratio respectively revealing a high prevalence of undernutriton,wasting and stunting. Longitudinal anthropometry indicated the compromised growth of children <b>over</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> period with growth velocity being much lower than normal children {{and the extent of}} insult was higher as children grew older. These observations indicate that interventions are needed to correct nutritional deficiencies and prevent the negative impact of undernutrition on secondary growth spurt of growing children...|$|R
