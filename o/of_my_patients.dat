6000|$|I {{never saw}} him again. I am bound to say, however, that {{thereafter}} my business increased, I recovered much of my old practice, and a few <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patients</b> recovered also. I became rich. I had a brougham and {{a house in the}} West End. But I often wondered, pondering on that wonderful man's penetration and insight, if, in some lapse of consciousness, I had not really stolen his cigar case! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For three years," [...] he replied, quietly, [...] "I was the {{physician}} {{in charge of}} that institution.

I made notes <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patient's</b> pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. There was nothing markedly abnormal {{in any of these}} conditions, which harmonized with my former experiences. I had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so leaving <b>my</b> <b>patient</b> seated in his chair, I ran down to get it. There was some little delay in finding it--five minutes, let us say--and then I returned. Imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone.|$|R

30|$|Given these premises, guaranteeing human {{subjects}} protection is mandatory for authors, editors and publishers, firstly because “the health <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patient</b> will be <b>my</b> first consideration” (from the World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva [1]), {{but also because}} biomedical publishing is not exempt from possible litigation. Since editors are ultimately responsible for what is published, they have to enforce strict requirements to ensure that proper ethical standards are fulfilled. Sometimes such requirements seem to subject authors to a burden of paperwork that equals the scientific effort, but intolerance of this is generated by a misinterpretation: science and ethics cannot stand alone, nor can they be neatly separated in any research project.|$|R

Now, it is a principle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> system never {{to go on for}} one move with a game when I find myself suspected. The slightest symptom of distrust, and--I back out immediately.

It saves one from all those twinges one feels about sudden friendships, for you know, after all, in a way, nothing at Étaples counted. You were just the most charming <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patients,</b> and the most interesting, but still a patient. Here, you simply walk into my life and take me by storm.

Up {{to a certain extent}} it will be a good thing for you, but mind, I distinctly forbid you to attempt any such folly as to try to walk from the Quartier Latin up to Passy. Let me see," [...] he added, thoughtfully. [...] "Yes, I think it can be managed. I will send you home by the ambulance that will be here to-morrow morning at eight o'clock. You are to keep yourself quiet all day, and I will get Madame de Millefleurs to send her carriage round for you at eleven o'clock next day, to take you round by Passy. She has told me many times that it is always at the disposal of any <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patients</b> to whom it would be useful. I will see her some time to-morrow and arrange about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "you will {{understand}} why I put such strange questions to you. My friend and I are both hard-working men. We go very little into society, as the phrase is; and {{neither he nor}} I had ever heard the name of Winterfield. As a certain proportion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>patients</b> happen to be people with a large experience of society, I undertook to make inquiries, so that the packet might be delivered, if possible, to the right person. You heard how Mrs. Eyrecourt (surely a likely lady to assist me?) received my unlucky reference to the madhouse; and you saw how I puzzled Sir John. I consider myself most fortunate, Father Benwell, in having had the honor of meeting you. Will you accompany me to the asylum to-morrow?
