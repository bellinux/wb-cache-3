5|$|From the 8th century AD <b>onward,</b> astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century <b>onward</b> they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eurostar {{initiated}} the Eurostar-Plus program, offering connecting tickets for <b>onward</b> journeys from Lille and Paris {{to dozens of}} destinations in France.|$|E
5|$|Micrography of {{thousands}} of snowflakes from 1885 <b>onward,</b> starting with Wilson Alwyn Bentley, revealed the wide diversity of snowflakes within a classifiable set of patterns. Closely matching snow crystals have been observed.|$|E
5|$|Nobel, P. (2005). <b>Onward</b> and upward? Four {{years after}} 9/11 – at perhaps {{the peak of}} the real estate bubble – very tall has never been hotter. Metropolis, 25, 66–72.|$|E
5|$|On the 21st, {{the local}} defence forces were enlisted to help mop up straggling German troops, and the 4th Indian Division pressed <b>onward</b> through a heavy gale {{and passed out}} of the country.|$|E
5|$|The ISSF {{announced}} that all finals from 2017 <b>onward</b> {{will have an}} additional 2 shots per initial string {{for a total of}} 24 shots fired in the final.|$|E
5|$|A {{centre of}} capitalism, Manchester {{was once the}} scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater {{political}} recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819. The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there, and Manchester was {{the centre of the}} Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 <b>onward.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 7.0 <b>onward,</b> FreeBSD {{supports}} the ZFS filesystem. ZFS was previously an open source filesystem that was first developed by Sun Microsystems, but when Oracle acquired Sun, ZFS became a proprietary product. However, the FreeBSD project is still developing and improving its ZFS implementation via the OpenZFS project.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} <b>onward</b> there was {{lobbying}} against gay bathhouses blaming them {{for being a}} focus of infection encouraging the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).|$|E
5|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and proventriculus, and then <b>onward</b> to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum, or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
5|$|Henry Dubar (who {{had helped}} recruit Doe {{personally}} years before) was promoted in one leap from captain to lieutenant general as Chief of Staff. From 1980 <b>onward,</b> Doe's systematic promotion of ethnic Krahn to sensitive {{posts in the}} government and military, began to drive deepening divisions within the AFL, among others with Quiwonkpa's Gio tribe, and to hamper morale.|$|E
5|$|In 1812 the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, also a horse-operated plateway, {{constructed}} to carry coal from the Kilmarnock {{area to the}} harbour at Troon, for <b>onward</b> conveyance by coastal shipping; {{it was the first}} railway in Scotland to have an authorising Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, kibbutz Beit Guvrin, {{was founded}} on the former town's lands. The {{excavated}} areas of the successive Judahite, Hellenistic, Roman-Byzantine and Crusader towns {{have been included in}} a large Israeli national park with major points of attraction for tourists. There is little focus on any traces of Arab presence within the park, the period from the 7th century <b>onward</b> receiving little attention.|$|E
5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, Superman: Ultimate Flight {{was ranked}} as three separate entries from 2002 through to 2010. The entries were grouped from 2012 <b>onward.</b> The ride's ranking {{in the polls}} {{is shown in the}} table below.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, DC {{established}} that characters appearing in comics published {{prior to the}} Silver Age lived on a parallel Earth the company dubbed Earth-Two. Characters introduced in the Silver Age and <b>onward</b> lived on Earth-One. It was {{established that}} the two realities were separated by a vibrational field that could be crossed, should a storyline involve superheroes from different worlds teaming up.|$|E
5|$|Japan Echo was {{at first}} {{released}} on a quarterly basis, but switched to a bimonthly format from 1997 and <b>onward.</b> It also had a French language edition which existed from 1979 and 2009 and a Spanish language edition from 1988 to 2009.|$|E
5|$|Lundy has {{evidence}} of visitation or occupation from the Neolithic period <b>onward,</b> with Mesolithic flintwork, Bronze Age burial mounds, four inscribed gravestones {{from the early}} medieval period, and an early medieval monastery (possibly dedicated to St Elen or St Helen).|$|E
5|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' {{frequent}} collaborator, {{composed the}} music for the pilot of Fringe, before handing over duties to his assistants Chad Seiter and Chris Tilton; Tilton took over scoring duties from Season 2 <b>onward.</b> While Giacchino retains an on-screen credit, Abrams himself wrote the series theme music.|$|E
5|$|Monssen {{avoided the}} wreck of Barton and steamed <b>onward</b> looking for targets. She was noticed by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare who had just {{finished}} blasting Laffey. They smothered Monssen with gunfire, damaging her severely and forcing the crew to abandon ship. The ship sank some time later.|$|E
5|$|National Rail {{services}} {{are available for}} <b>onward</b> journeys, from stations at Oban, which has direct services to Glasgow and from Kyle of Lochalsh to Inverness. There are scheduled flights from Broadford Airfield Skye, Colonsay Airport, Islay Airport near Port Ellen and Tiree Airport.|$|E
5|$|National Rail {{services}} {{are available for}} <b>onward</b> journeys, from stations at Oban, which has direct services to Glasgow. However, parliamentary approval notwithstanding, plans in the 1890s to lay a railway connection to Ullapool were unable to obtain sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|Past Forward Road, NY321 becomes {{concurrent}} with CR66 as {{maintenance of}} the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to OnondagaCounty. The state designation {{comes to an end}} at NY5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of Camillus shortly after; however, CR66 continues <b>onward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{minutes after}} initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other, {{at about the}} same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated {{ordering}} their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks stacked with high explosive (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, was momentarily uncertain if he should withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue <b>onward.</b> He decided to continue <b>onward.</b> Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements, and delayed too long in acting.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} streams has cut combes through the hills {{down to the}} sea, which are now wooded, {{although}} much of Exmoor is open heathland. There is an outlier of Exmoor at North Hill near Minehead. Iron working was formerly carried out, probably from the Roman period <b>onward.</b>|$|E
5|$|The highway heads <b>onward</b> {{through the}} town of Mendon, leaving the densely {{populated}} village and its lightly populated outskirts for the rolling, open areas that dominate much of southern Monroe County. Three miles (5km) {{to the north of}} Honeoye Falls, NY65 intersects NY251 by way of a roundabout northeast of the hamlet of Rochester Junction. The community, located on NY251, marks the point where the Lehigh Valley Railroad spur that went to the railroad's station in downtown Rochester returned to the main line. The route continues <b>onward,</b> passing alongside the western edge of Mendon Ponds Park as it enters the town of Pittsford. At the northern edge of the park, NY65 curves to the northeast and passes over the New York State Thruway (Interstate90).|$|E
5|$|The programme's pilot {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on 16 April 2007 {{and was the}} entitled The Professor of Curiosity. The guests for this episode were Alastair Fothergill, Victoria Finlay and Simon Munnery. This pilot, recorded at the Rutherford Room at the institute of Physics, has not been broadcast. The first series was recorded at the Pleasance Theatre in Islington and, since then, the show has been recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre, with occasional recordings at other venues, such as the Shaw Theatre and RADA Studios (formerly The Drill Hall), all in London. The series was created by Lloyd, Richard Turner and Dan Schreiber. Turner and Schreiber also produce the show. The show's researchers are James Harkin, Xander Cansell (for series one), Molly Oldfield (from series two <b>onward)</b> and Stevyn Colgan (Series 5 <b>onward).</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the U.S. Congress approved the Jones–Shafroth Act, which extended United States citizenship (the Puerto Rican House of Delegates rejected US citizenship) with limitations upon Puerto Ricans and made them eligible for the military draft. As citizens of the United States, Puerto Ricans have participated in every major United States military engagement from World War I <b>onward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wood {{began her}} career {{appearing}} in several made-for-television films from 1994 <b>onward,</b> also playing an occasional {{role in the}} television series American Gothic. After a one-season role on the television drama Profiler, Wood was cast in the supporting role of Jessie Sammler on the television show Once and Again.|$|E
5|$|All {{three main}} {{terminals}} {{used by the}} Eurostar service – St Pancras International, Paris Gare du Nord, and Brussels Midi/Zuid – are served by domestic trains and by local urban transport networks such as the London Underground and the Paris Metro. Standard Eurostar tickets no longer include free <b>onward</b> connections to or from any other station in Belgium: this is now available for a flat-rate supplement, currently £5.50.|$|E
5|$|Amfortas arrives, borne on a {{stretcher}} by Knights of the Grail. He calls out for Gawain, whose attempt at relieving the King's pain had failed. He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy. Raising himself somewhat, the King says going off without leave ("?") {{is the sort of}} impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall. He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him <b>onward</b> to his bath.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 <b>onward</b> of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 <b>onward,</b> the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E
5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century <b>onward,</b> however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{was elected}} king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking {{personal}} glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–1618 (the end of Dymitriads), in 1619 he went to Silesia, looking {{for an opportunity to}} aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years' War. That opportunity never came, but from that point <b>onward,</b> Władysław had a good relationship with George William, Elector of Brandenburg.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, Pichilemu had 1,468 inhabitants. In 1787, Pichilemu held 1,688 inhabitants, and the {{population}} rose to 11,829 by 1895. From there <b>onward,</b> the city's population progressively decreased: 7,787 inhabitants in 1907; 7,424 in 1920; 6,929 in 1930; and 6,570 in 1940. In 1952, the city's population increased to 7,150 inhabitants; however, the 1960 census showed it decreased to 5,724 inhabitants, and to 5,459 in 1970. The {{number of people in}} Pichilemu reached 8,844 in 1982, and in 1992, 10,510. As of the 2002 census, {{the population}} comprised 12,392 people, and 6,228 households.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s <b>onward,</b> the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
