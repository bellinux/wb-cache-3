5000|$|The 100 krooni {{banknote}} (100 EEK) is a denomination of the Estonian kroon, {{the former}} currency of Estonia. Lydia Koidula (1843-1886), {{who was an}} Estonian poet and playwright, is featured on the front side <b>of</b> the <b>banknote,</b> <b>which</b> is why the 100 krooni banknote is often called a [...] "Koidula".|$|R
5|$|The Kombo Moyana series {{refers to}} a series <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>which</b> carried Kombo Moyana's {{signature}} after being appointed governor of the Reserve Bank from 1983 to August 1993. The series bears the new name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is indifferent to the last two series except for the date and signature.|$|R
50|$|The portrait's {{placement}} {{differed from}} earlier banknote series {{that had an}} oval-framed portrait in the centre <b>of</b> the <b>banknote,</b> <b>which</b> was more susceptible to wearing as it occurred at the crease point for a folded banknote. This was the first series to include the Canadian coat <b>of</b> arms, <b>which</b> appeared centrally {{in the background of}} the obverse.|$|R
50|$|Jiaozi {{was a form}} <b>of</b> <b>banknote</b> <b>which</b> {{appeared}} around 10th {{century in}} the Sichuan capital of Chengdu, China.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Morrison was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Currency Note Design Group, an advisory committee which assisted with the design <b>of</b> new <b>banknotes</b> <b>which</b> were issued when Australia replaced its pounds, shillings, and pence with [...] "dismal guernsey" [...] (decimal currency) on 14 February 1966.

25|$|The fourth was {{introduced}} in 1990 by the Bundesbank to counter advances in forgery technology. The notes depicted German artists and scientists together with symbols and tools of their trade. This series added a 200-mark denomination, to decrease the use <b>of</b> 100-mark <b>banknotes,</b> <b>which</b> made up 54% of all circulating banknotes, and {{to fill the gap}} between the DM 100 and DM 500 denominations.|$|R
50|$|Economic conditions, {{together}} with poor management and political intrigue, {{led to a}} move by the board to wind up the Bank in January 1844, which was not completed until December 1848 with its sale to new owners. William Brown Phipps, who had been Manager since 1841, returned to become Manager of the revived Bank in March 1849. In June 1849, it flooded Toronto and Buffalo with new issues <b>of</b> its <b>banknotes,</b> <b>which</b> were subsequently boycotted by merchants. It was finally closed in 1854.|$|R
50|$|Money art is {{a subject}} related to counterfeiting—it is art that {{incorporates}} currency designs or themes. Some of these works of art are similar enough to actual bills that their legality is in question. While a counterfeit is made with deceptive intent, money art is not; however, the law {{may or may not}} differentiate between the two. JSG Boggs was an American artist best known for his hand-drawn, one-sided copies <b>of</b> US <b>banknotes,</b> <b>which</b> he sold for the face value of the note.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{departed}} {{inside the}} bank and reappeared {{in the course of}} a few moments. His breast coat pocket was bulging. On our way back he drew out five packets <b>of</b> <b>banknotes,</b> <b>which</b> he counted carefully. Captain Bannister watched him out of the corner of his eye with a hungry expression. We were only absent from the flat altogether about a quarter of an hour, and the rest of the affair was promptly settled. The notes were counted by Mr. Cheape, the document signed by Captain Bannister and Mrs. Delaporte.|$|R
50|$|The Zimbabwean {{approached}} Johannesburg-based {{advertising agency}} TBWA/Hunt/Lascaris for {{ideas on how}} to make the export of the paper to Zimbabwe economically viable. The concept for the campaign was born from a meeting between the two companies, when representatives from the newspaper showed examples of the currency used to purchase The Zimbabwean in Zimbabwe itself. After years of hyperinflation, the Zimbabwean Dollar had reached the point where the face value <b>of</b> many <b>banknotes</b> (<b>which</b> had reached denominations as high as Z$100,000,000,000,000) was less than the value of the paper itself.|$|R

His son, Dr. G.P.C. de Kock also served as a Governor of the South African Reserve Bank.|$|R
50|$|Loder, {{who still}} owes money to disreputable {{characters}} {{at the local}} inn, is still in possession <b>of</b> Mauleverer’s <b>banknote,</b> <b>which</b> {{he has no intention}} of passing to Prout. He plans to “borrow” the banknote to place a bet on a racehorse, “Gay Goldfish”, and use his winnings to repay his debts and replace the note. But his plans are frustrated by Billy Bunter, who is hoping to borrow some of the ten pounds himself, and who asks Prout whether Mauleverer could be permitted to have a small part of the remittance. Prout, who knows nothing of the matter, questions Loder, who is forced to hand over the banknote to the temporary headmaster. Loder is admonished by Prout for his apparent carelessness.|$|R
50|$|There are drug levels above <b>which</b> <b>banknotes</b> need to {{be taken}} out of circulation, and over £15 million worth of notes are {{destroyed}} annually for this reason. The destruction is more often done as a precaution than because the money poses a serious health hazard.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, the Bank of Canada hired The Strategic Counsel for $476,000 {{to create}} an image {{catalogue}} from <b>which</b> <b>banknote</b> images would be drawn. The research firm polled focus groups in six cities, finding that themes related to diversity and multiculturalism had strong support. This resulted in 41 images reflecting eight themes that were scored by the firm and presented to the Bank of Canada.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 October 2009, 5,000-kyats {{banknotes}} {{were issued}} measuring 150 x 70mm. Along the top front is written Central Bank of Myanmar in Burmese, {{and in the}} centre is a white elephant. On the back {{is a picture of}} the Central Bank of Myanmar with [...] "FIVE THOUSAND KYATS 5000" [...] written in English. This new denomination is five times larger than the previous largest denomination. Public response has been mixed, with some welcoming a higher value note reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>which</b> need to be carried. Other responses have suggested a widespread fear that this will simply fuel the current rate <b>of</b> inflation, <b>which</b> was supported by a jump in the black market exchange rates following the public announcement of this change. The Central Bank of Myanmar introduced new 5,000-kyats banknotes on 1 October 2014 to prevent counterfeiting, it reported on 18 September. The revised notes are varnished and have enhancements made to the printing, watermarks, and security thread and is the same size, colour and design as the 2009 issue, which continues to be used.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority issued {{banknotes}} in denominations of 1, 5, 20 and 100 dollars, all featuring Pietro Annigoni’s 1956 {{portrait of}} Queen Elizabeth II in regalia of Order of the Garter. The first {{issues in the}} name of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in 1985 were of the same denominations, with the addition of 10-dollar notes. The last 1-dollar notes were issued in 1989 and 50-dollar notes were introduced in 1993. On April 1, 2008, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank issued a new series <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>which</b> are like the preceding issues, except for omitting both the barcode and the country code letters <b>which</b> form part <b>of</b> the serial number on current notes. In 2012, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank issued a series of banknotes with Braille features in an effort to provide notes which are easier for blind and visually impaired persons to use. The raised Braille characters on the upgraded notes feature a cricket theme in the form of balls and stumps. These characters have been added to the 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-dollar notes.|$|R
5000|$|The Trillion Dollar Campaign was {{launched}} in March 2009. Banknotes of denominations between Z$1,000,000 and Z$100,000,000,000, each bearing one of four English-language advertising slogans, the website address for The Zimbabwean, its logo, and its tagline [...] "A voice for the voiceless", were handed out to motorists stopped at busy intersections in Johannesburg. Rolls of the altered currency were mailed to industry figures, media personalities, and politicians. Posters were put up at every location selling copies of the newspaper in the city, murals 1.5 m tall by 5 m wide were pasted across walls along streets with heavy foot traffic, and billboard spaces were purchased overlooking several highways. All were composed of hundreds or thousands <b>of</b> <b>banknotes,</b> <b>which</b> could be detached and taken home {{by members of the}} public. The four slogans used in the campaign were [...] "Fight The Regime That Has Crippled A Country", [...] "Its Cheaper To Print This On Money Than Paper", [...] "Z$250 000 000 Cannot Buy The Paper To Print This Poster On", and [...] "Thanks to Mugabe This Money Is Wallpaper".|$|R

25|$|In the post-communist period, {{there has}} been a switch in the {{material}} used for banknotes and coins. Banknotes have switched from special paper to special plastic, while coins switched from aluminum to more common coin alloys (probably partly due to technical limitations of coin-operated vending machines). The transition has been gradual for both, but much faster for the <b>banknotes</b> <b>which</b> are currently all made of plastic. There has been a period in <b>which</b> all <b>banknotes</b> were made of plastic and all coins were made of aluminum, a very distinctive combination.|$|R
