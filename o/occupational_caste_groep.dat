40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>caste</b> is {{deprived}} {{in terms}} of education, and landholding. Due to this laboring and agriculture (specially small animals like goats and poultry) remain the prominent {{source of income for}} them. Average income from salaried job is the highest followed by remittance and that from laboring is the lowest. This led to the high concentration of <b>Occupational</b> <b>caste</b> under third and fourth income quartile (poorer). A share of income from agriculture in total income is the highest and the share from laboring is the lowest. Relative concentration coefficient (RCC-ci or gi) shows salaried job has both the highest income disequalizing effect (ci = 1. 56 or gi = 1. 49) as well as the highest factor inequality weight (wici) followed by agriculture. In case of Melauli, however, salaried job followed by remittance has the highest income disequalizing effect. Negative values of Relative Concentration Coefficient and factor inequality weight for laboring indicate that income from it has the income equalizing effect. Thus, agricultural promotion in rural areas based on labor demand increasing policies with proper market arrangement for the agricultural produce will be helpful to reduce the income inequality. In addition, regulation regarding working hour and minimal wage rate should be strictly enforced for the welfare of those involved in laboring, which is also the poorest. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{research}} goals and procedures were ambitious; to empirically bring together interactions of individual, culture, community and institutions, relating real individuals, not merely statistical patterns, for functional-historical analysis of character formation {{at the village}} level in the three settlements chosen: Bakrana, a Hindu village in Gujarat; Sujarupa, a Hindu hamlet in Rajputana; and Adhon, a predominantly Muslim village in the United Provinces. Bakrana was a farming economy in fertile flatlands, exclusively Hindu and with an active caste system, largely untouched by the former British rule or by land reform changes current then in India. Sujarupa hamlet was a single-caste community in the upland valleys. Adhon was controlled by pro-independence Muslims, with more <b>occupational</b> <b>castes</b> and subgroups than Bakrana, with religious minorities.|$|R

40|$|Realizing the {{importance}} of food self-sufficiency in achieving the household food security, this paper tried to assess the food self-sufficiency situation in village areas of Nepal. Agriculture was {{the main source of}} livelihood and Bahun/Chhetri was the dominant ethnic group. Involvement of households in agriculture was found declining with the attainment of higher level of education resulting into higher concentration of illiterate and just literate manpower in this sector. The major resource determining food self-sufficiency of households, land holding and coverage of irrigation was higher among Bahun/Chhetri ethnic group and in Tarai ecological region. The better irrigation coverage together with relatively high assess to production resources led to the higher yield among Bahun/Chhetri ethnic group and in Tarai. Thus, Tarai was experiencing surplus food crops production, which was merely enough to fulfill the deficit of Hills and Mountain regions. Food self-sufficiency was achieved among 72 % of households in Tarai region while the figure of Mountain region was only 11 %. Similarly, the highest proportion (53 %) of Bahun/Chhetri households achieved food self-sufficiency compared to mere 10 % of <b>Occupational</b> <b>caste</b> households. Together with small land holding and land productivity, production shift from food crops to cash crops were also the major factors responsible for food self-insufficiency. Purchasing was the most dominant means to fulfill the deficit food. About 19 % of food self-insufficient households were unable to meet minimum level of food security threshold income for deficit months. This constituted 10 % of sample households, who were in chronic food insecurity situation. The incidence of chronic food insecurity as well as poverty gap was the highest in female-headed households, Mountain region, <b>Occupational</b> <b>caste,</b> daily wage laborers and small landholders. Education received the highest priority for the cash income expenditure followed by food items and agriculture promotion. This expenditure patterns show the positive indication to move towards food self-sufficiency and ultimately to food security if provided with better off farm employment opportunities and better market for both farm produces and essential inputs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyze the {{relationship}} between household’s resource endow-ment and food security status. It also aims to find out the household’s coping strategies when they face food deficit condition. The analysis indicates that the distribution of resources is highly favorable to higher caste and has direct impact on household food security condition. It also shows that the depth and the severity of food insecurity vary according to socio-economic characteristics of household. Both depth and severity are higher in <b>occupational</b> <b>caste,</b> small landholders, fewer livestock holders, laborers, and households with less consumption expenses. To become more food secure and in response to food deficit condition, households adopted both ex ante and ex post coping strategies, such as casual laboring, occupational work, selling of agricultural and livestock products, collection of wild foods, borrowing food or money, use of savings, seasonal migration to the places outside the district, within the country or in foreign countries, small business, use of pension, and so on...|$|R
5000|$|In the Central Highlands, many {{traditions of}} the Kingdom of Kandy were {{preserved}} from its 1818 collapse beyond independence in 1948 and the Land Reform Act of the 1970s. Although large agricultural landlords belonged to the Govigama caste, many now may not own land. Most Goyigama were however ordinary farmers and tenants as absolute land ownership was exclusive to the king until the British colonial period. In addition to the Govigama, there were several strata of <b>occupational</b> <b>castes.</b> Wahumpura or Deva were the caste who traditionally made jaggery and farmed. The Bathgama caste was also engaged in agriculture with access to some land. The Navandanna (Achari) caste were artisans. The Rada were washers, and this caste is still prevalent in Sri Lanka's laundry sector. The Berava were traditional drummers and agricultural wage laborers. The Kinnara caste did menial work and were segregated {{from the rest of}} the community. The most important feature of the Kandyan system was Rajakariya ("the king's work"), which linked each caste to an occupation and demanded service to the court and religious institutions.|$|R

40|$|Involvement {{of higher}} {{proportion}} of economically active population in agriculture and laboring among the <b>Occupational</b> <b>caste</b> resulted into higher incidence of poverty, which is also severer and deeper. This resulted into as high as 71 % incidence of poverty in Banjhkateri, purely remote village. The incidence, depth and severity of poverty are the highest among large family size households, illiterate households, and small land and livestock holding households. Share of income from agriculture, remittance, and salaried job shares {{is the most significant}} one contributing 46. 1 %, 23. 3 % and 19. 0 % of total income, respectively. However, income from salaried job and remittance has income disequalizing effect and also has higher factor inequality weight acting as the source of income inequality. Agriculture and laboring, upon which huge proportion of economically active population is engaged and entry is also not restricted, however has income equalizing effect. This suggests the need for promotion of labor-intensive agriculture as a better rural development policy in the rural Nepalese context. In the context of lack of well-defined working hours as well as minimum wage rate such rural development policies should be supplemented by formulation and effective enforcement of labor policy. ...|$|R
