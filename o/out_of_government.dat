He also restored the Earl of Marlborough to all his offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> affairs, {{and he did not}} make her regent in his absences though she was now his heir apparent.|$|E

Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in their role as Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|Antigua had {{a general}} {{election}} in 2004, following the dissolution of Parliament in late February; with the ALP running a full slate, Joseph was nominated for the St Mary's North seat. The ALP were conclusively defeated by the United Progressive Party (UPP) and forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> Joseph lost his seat to Bertrand Joseph.

In 2007, he was appointed by Bird to act as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Education. In the 2009 general election he again ran for St Mary's North, defeating Bertrand Joseph by 21 votes; despite this, the UPP retained power. Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest against the UPP government, Joseph and six other senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were {{arrested and charged with}} public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined.|$|E

5|$|Most {{migrants}} {{were people}} from the lower economic strata who had been left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and economic jobs; their lands had been confiscated due to heavy taxation under the Portuguese in Goa. As {{a consequence of the}} wealth and privileges which these Goan migrants enjoyed in Mangalore, they began feeling superior to their landless kindred in Goa. Their captivity at Seringapatam (1784–1799), where many died, were killed, or were forcibly converted to Islam, {{led to the formation of}} a separate and common Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity among members of the group, who hitherto had considered themselves an extension of the larger Goan Catholic community. They no longer self-identified as Goan Catholics. After their years of captivity, prosperity under the British and under Italian Jesuits, followed by migration for employment to Bombay, Calcutta, Poona, the Persian Gulf Arab states, and the English-speaking world, enabled the community to restore their identity. The overwhelming majority of Mangalorean Catholics are of Goud Saraswat Brahmin lineage. Historian Alan Machado Prabhu estimates that almost 95 per cent of Mangalorean Catholics have Goan origins.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its success}} in elections, the PNȚ was blocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> by the Royal Prerogative of King Ferdinand (who had {{preferred}} to nominate Brătianu, Averescu, and Prince Barbu Știrbey).

He also showed himself open to deals proposed by Viscount Rothermere regarding {{a review of the}} Treaty of Trianon and, as King Ferdinand's death approached, started negotiations with the disinherited Prince Carol (King Ferdinand's son), proposing that the latter bypass the Constitution and crown himself in Alba Iulia (as a new foundation for the Romanian Kingdom). Talks with Carol were ended abruptly after the Romanian authorities called on the United Kingdom to expel the Prince from its territory.|$|E

25|$|Because Egyptian society {{under the}} Greeks and Romans was governed bureaucratically, and because Oxyrhynchus was {{the capital of}} the 19th nome, the {{material}} at the Oxyrhynchus dumps included vast amounts of papyri. Accounts, tax returns, census material, invoices, receipts, correspondence on administrative, military, religious, economic, and political matters, certificates and licenses of all kindsall these were periodically cleaned <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> offices, put in wicker baskets, and dumped out in the desert. Private citizens added their own piles of unwanted papyri. Because papyrus was expensive, papyri were often reused: a document might have farm accounts on one side, and a student's text of Homer on the other. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, therefore, contained a complete record {{of the life of the}} town, and of the civilizations and empires of which the town was a part.|$|E
25|$|In 1739, {{conflict}} between Spain and Britain {{led to the}} War of Jenkins' Ear, followed in 1740-41 by the War of the Austrian Succession. The long-serving British Prime Minister Robert Walpole {{was forced to resign}} in February 1742 by an alliance of Tories and pro-war Patriot Whigs. The Whigs promptly did a deal keeping their Tory partners <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> Fury at this led second-rank Tories like the Duke of Beaufort and Lord Barrymore to ask for French support in restoring the Stuarts to the British throne. The group of Scottish Jacobites known as the Association made a similar request but to put James on the throne of Scotland and dissolve the Union. These differences were not lost on the French Chief Minister Cardinal Fleury who consistently viewed Jacobite claims with scepticism and ignored both requests.|$|E
25|$|Loos {{sailed to}} the east coast where for the 1918 {{shipping}} season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.

The Department of Marine and Fisheries took over the vessel and converted Loos to a lighthouse supply and buoy vessel in 1922. In the late 1930s, the vessel was sold <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> service to Marine Industries. However, the RCN reacquired the vessel on 12 December 1940. The former trawler was converted to a gate vessel and re-designated Gate Vessel 14 and deployed at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Following the war, the ship was returned to Marine Industries and broken up in 1949.|$|E
