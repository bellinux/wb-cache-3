The signs and symptoms of neonatal encephalopathy may range from mild to severe, depending on nature and timing of brain injury. The incidence of cerebral palsy has not changed over the last 30 years and one of the obstetricians’challenge is how to recognize babies at intrapartum risk both before and during labour. A detailed description of prepartum and intrapartum risk factors is available. A close surveillance of labour and intrapartum time should be mandatory as the valuation of all available data from <b>obstetrical</b> examination, cardiotocography, <b>ultrasound</b> and labour progression to reach the correct diagnosis with the lowest possible rate of error. The close monitoring should not exclude a humanized and compliant attitude versus labouring women and their families. We analysed the Cagliari Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) activity during the last four years considering 22 asphyxiated babies (coming from 9 different hospitals) who underwent hypothermia treatment. The main result was that the need to resuscitation procedures at birth correlates with adverse outcomes. Asphyxia still remains a matter of great concern also as medico legal claims. Considering that neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous condition, it is unlikely that it will be eradicated.

40|$|BackgroundSystemic {{absorption}} of phthalates and parabens {{has been demonstrated}} after dermal application of body lotion, and medical devices such as intravenous bags and tubing {{have been identified as}} a source of exposure to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). However, use of products during medical procedures such as aqueous gel applied during <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in pregnancy has not been investigated as a potential source of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure. Human studies have associated EDCs with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to identify sources of inadvertent exposure to EDCs especially during vulnerable developmental periods such as pregnancy. ObjectivesWe conducted a pilot study to determine whether use of gel during routine <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound</b> increased urinary concentrations of phthalate and phenol biomarkers. MethodsWe recruited 13 women from the Massachusetts General Hospital who provided spot urine samples {{at the time of their}} second trimester anatomic survey. The first sample was collected prior to the procedure (pre-exposure, time 1), and two additional samples were obtained at approximately 12 ̆ 0132 hours (time 2) and 72 ̆ 01312 hours (time 3) post-exposure following the scan. ResultsUrinary concentrations of several DEHP metabolites and metabolite of diisononyl cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH) increased across time. For example, the geometric mean concentrations of mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate increased from 3. 1 ng/ml to 7. 1 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 03) between time 1 and time 3. We also observed significant differences in concentrations of metabolites of butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP). For example, mono-n-butyl phthalate (metabolite of DnBP) decreased from 3. 5 ng/ml to 1. 8 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 04) between time 1 and time 2, but then increased to 6. 6 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 002) at time 3. Propylparaben concentrations increased from 8. 9 ng/ml to 33. 6 ng/ml between time 1 and time 2 (p-value= 0. 005), followed by a decrease to 12. 9 ng/ml at time 3 (p-value= 0. 01). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed differences are due to other sources of exposure to these compounds. ConclusionsWhile additional research is needed, this pilot study potentially identifies a previously unknown source of phthalate and paraben exposure among pregnant women undergoing routine ultrasound examination.

Among the 355 respondents, (response rate 87 %) we found that 75 % of parents reported that they would take their febrile neonate for immediate medical assessment, with nearly one fifth of the sample reporting that they would not seek medical care. We found no significant associations between the choice to seek medical care and expectant parents socio-demographic characteristics. Despite universal access to high quality health care in Canada, our study highlights concerning gaps in the knowledge of the care of the febrile infant in one fifth of expectant parents. Physicians and health providers should strive to provide early education to expectant parents about how to recognize signs of fever in the neonate and how best to seek medical care. This may improve neonatal health outcomes in Canada...|$|E
40|$|Results from {{ultrasound}} in low-risk {{pregnant women}} are significant when routine screening is performed {{on a large}} population because the anomalies are rare. Professionals expect from routine ultrasound objective information that cannot usually be obtained by clinical procedures. Parents seek reassurance about the absence of fetal congenital anomalies and overall fetal health. Therefore, Europeans view routine ultrasound {{as a part of}} obstetrical care, capable of filling important gaps by delivering much key information for improving obstetrical practice. Fetal anomalies screening (FAS) requires higher education and qualifications than <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The health insurance systems support ultrasound screening and allow its spread in most European countries; approximately 98 % of pregnant women are examined by ultrasound and, frequently, two to three times (usually once per trimester). Detection rate of congenital anomalies is about 28 % in geographical areas (private practice and hospitals), 60 to 80 % in Ob/Gyn's ultrasound labs. Routine ultrasound screening policy has not proved to result in an immoderate use of ultrasound; on the contrary, chaotic use of routine ultrasound can lead to an unproductive and excessive number of scans. New trends in FAS, such as the early detection of fetal defects and chromosomal anomalies, bring more arguments for routine screening. Effectiveness should increase by enhancing education and training and the systematic referral for FAS to accredited laboratories.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{the role}} of folic acid (FA) in {{preventing}} neural tube defects (NTDs) is well documented, its optimal intake in pregnant women is still low in many countries. Here, we prospectively studied the prevalence of NTDs in the newborns and the patterns of FA intake in pregnant Saudi mothers. MethodsThis case–control study was nested within a 3 -year project (July 2010 to June 2013) to study the patterns of birth defects in the offspring of Saudi women who received their antenatal care and delivered at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh—Saudi Arabia. Enrolled mothers were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (FA taken before pregnancy and continued regularly after conception), group 2 (FA taken post-conception), group 3 (no FA intake), and group 4 (did not remember or were unsure of taking FA). Control mothers {{were randomly selected from}} those with normal first <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound</b> scan at 18 – 22 weeks of gestation. ResultsThe cohort included 30, 531 mothers giving birth to 28, 646 infants. We studied 1179 mothers of babies with birth defects (BDs) and 1262 control mothers. There were 237 (9. 7 %) mothers in-group 1; 2001 (82 %) in-group 2; 154 (6. 3 %) in-group 3; and 49 (2 %) in-group 4. There were 49 babies with NTDs, a prevalence of 1. 7 / 1000 total births. Among the studied mothers 2274 (93 %) took FA either full or partial course. ConclusionThe high prevalence of NTDs and the low optimal FA intake highlight the need for a strict implementation of staple food fortification and health education program for Saudi women...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{complete}} {{heart block}} is a life-threatening condition which is highly associated with autoimmune and connective tissue disorders. Presence of maternal autoantibodies for associated conditions {{increases the risk}} of delivering a child with congenital complete heart block, however, less than a half of all women with such antibodies are symptomatic even after delivery. Mortality rate is highest during the neonatal period (45 %) and about two-thirds of all cases will require permanent pacing {{at some point in their}} lives. We report a case of isolated complete heart block in a 5 -year-old HIV-free girl of African descent born to an HIV-infected woman with no prior history of autoimmune disorders. She was referred to us with chief complaints of recurrent syncopal attacks and effort intolerance since birth. A physical examination was unremarkable except for her being small for her age (body mass index 16. 3 kg/m(2)) and bradycardia. Her vital signs were within acceptable range with the exception of her pulse rate, which ranged between 22 and 34 beats/minute. An echocardiogram revealed a sinus bradycardia, otherwise a structurally normal heart. An electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular dissociation in keeping with third-degree atrioventricular block. The child underwent a permanent epicardial pacemaker insertion and has been symptom-free following pacing. Despite its infrequency and life-threatening potential, patients with congenital complete heart block have an excellent survival rate with timely diagnosis and intervention. An incidental detection of bradycardia in a fetus during routine <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound</b> examination should increase the index of suspicion for congenital complete heart block and warrant a screening for associated maternal autoantibodies...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Embora o exame de ultrassonografia seja um procedimento frequente na gravidez, o seu uso rotineiro não demonstrou efetividade sobre a redução da morbi-mortalidade materna ou perinatal. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a cobertura do exame das mamas e da citologia oncótica {{cervical}} entre os exames de pré-natal, comparando-se com o número de ultrassonografias obstétricas realizadas. MÉTODOS: Constituiu-se de uma avaliação transversal, realizada na cidade de Rio Grande (RS), entre maio e julho de 2007. Os dados obtidos por meio de um questionário estruturado foram digitados no programa Epi-Info 6. 04 e analisados no software SPSS. RESULTADOS: Entre as 230 puérperas entrevistadas, 99, 1 % realizaram ultrassonografia durante a gravidez, enquanto 37, 5 % e 33, 6 % realizaram exame clínico das mamas ou colpocitologia cervical, respectivamente. Houve significância estatística (p-valor Although {{ultrasound examination}} {{is a frequent}} procedure during pregnancy, routine use has not been effective to reduce maternal or perinatal morbidity-mortality. OBJECTIVE: Assess frequency of breast examination and of oncotic cervical cytology among prenatal exams and compare it to frequency of <b>obstetrical</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> METHODS: This was a cross-sectional evaluation conducted {{in the city of}} Rio Grande, RS, Brazil between May and July 2007. Data obtained with a structured questionnaire were entered into the Epi-Info 6. 04 program and analyzed using the SPSS software. RESULTS: Among the 230 puerperae interviewed, 99. 1 % had undergone an ultrasound during pregnancy, while 37. 5 % and 33. 6 % had been submitted to clinical examination of the breasts and cervical cytology, respectively. It was noted that a larger number of obstetrical echographies increased the probability that a patient would be submitted to clinical examination of the breasts. On the other hand, the number of cytopathological evaluations of the uterine cervix was not influenced by the number of ultrasound examinations. CONCLUSION: Obstetrical echography was given priority and performed as a routine exam, whereas clinical examination of the breasts and cervical cytopathological examination were not, although considered obligatory during the prenatal period. These data confirm the tendency documented in literature indicating an inversion of priorities, favoring ultrasonography over breast examination and cervical pathological exams. For this reason, further studies and evaluations of health programs, also of the real impact of this inversion on the population health indices are recommended...|$|E
