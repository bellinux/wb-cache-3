In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E

500|$|In the USAF's FY 2015 budget, {{the service}} {{considered}} retiring the A-10 and other single-mission aircraft, prioritizing multi-mission aircraft; cutting a whole fleet and its infrastructure {{was seen as}} the only method for major savings. The U.S. Army had expressed interest in obtaining some A-10s should the Air Force retire them, but later stated there was [...] "no chance" [...] <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening.</b> The U.S. Air Force stated that retirement would save $3.7 billion from 2015 to 2019. The prevalence of guided munitions allow more aircraft to perform the CAS mission and reduces the requirement for specialized aircraft; since 2001 multirole aircraft and bombers have performed 80 percent of operational CAS missions. The Air Force also said that the A-10 was more vulnerable to advanced anti-aircraft defenses, but the Army replied that the A-10 had proved invaluable because of its versatile weapons loads, psychological impact, and limited logistics needs on ground support systems.|$|E
500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening.</b> I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it â€“ he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martha {{is first}} seen in action with UNIT in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively if the Doctor turns {{all of his}} companions into [...] "soldiers". The Doctor also appears to {{disapprove}} over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not carry a gun, and stating that {{she is trying to}} make UNIT [...] "better" [...] from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun-toting: [...] "I never felt any danger <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening.</b> At the end of Series Three, she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still has this caring side to her".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Simon {{received}} {{the first annual}} Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. On being notified of the honor, Simon said, [...] "I am grateful to be {{the recipient of the}} Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> again. It's a songwriter's dream come true." [...] Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is now available as Paul Simon and Friends.|$|E

6000|$|The tale <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> is {{graphically}} {{told by the}} pen of the admiring Macchiavelli, who {{names the}} affair [...] "Il Bellissimo Inganno." [...] That he so named it should suffice us and restrain us from criticisms of our own, accepting that criticism of his. To us, judged from our modern standpoint, the affair of Sinigaglia is {{the last word in}} treachery and iscariotism. But you are here concerned with the standpoint of the Cinquecento, and that standpoint Macchiavelli gives you when he describes this business as [...] "the beautiful stratagem." [...] To offer judgment in despite of that is to commit a fatuity, which too often already has been committed.|$|E
60|$|Darkness {{had closed}} down outside, and the lamp was lighted in Devine's office, which {{occupied}} {{a projection of}} the wooden ranch. Behind it stood the kitchen, and a short corridor, which gave access to both, led back from its inner door to the main building. Another door opened directly on to the clearing, and a grove of willows, past which the trail led, crept close up to it, so that any one standing among them could see into the room. There was, however, little probability <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening,</b> for nobody lived in that stretch of forest, except the miners, whose shanty stood almost a mile away. Devine sat opposite {{the captain of the}} mine across the little table, and he had let his cigar go out, while his face was a trifle grim.|$|E

"If," [...] she continued, [...] "if I {{found it}} was your birth, and your name, and your wealth that I coveted, and had nearly taken, ought I not to feel humiliated, and ask pardon of you and of God? Oh, what perjuries poor Clara was made to speak,--and see what has befallen her! We stood by and heard her without being shocked. We applauded even. And to what shame and misery we brought her! Why did her parents and mine consign her to such ruin! She might have lived pure and happy but for us. With her example before me--not her flight, poor child--I am not afraid <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> to me--but her long solitude, the misery of her wasted years,--my brother's own wretchedness and faults aggravated a hundredfold by his unhappy union with her--I must pause while it is yet time, and recall a promise which I know I should make you unhappy if I fulfilled. I ask your pardon that I deceived you, Lord Farintosh, and feel ashamed for myself that I could have consented to do so." ...|$|E

60|$|Lionel looked up, his eye brightening. Then {{a thought}} {{occurred}} to him; a thought so mean that again the colour flooded into his cheeks, for he was shamed by it. Yet it clung. If he sailed with Oliver, men would {{say that he was}} a partner in the guilt attributed to his brother. He knew--from more than one remark addressed him here or there, and left by him uncontradicted--that the belief was abroad on the countryside that a certain hostility was springing up between himself and Sir Oliver on the score <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>happening</b> in Godolphin Park. His pale looks and hollow eyes had contributed to the opinion that his brother's sin was weighing heavily upon him. He had ever been known for a gentle, kindly lad, in all things the very opposite of the turbulent Sir Oliver, and it was assumed that Sir Oliver in his present increasing harshness used his brother ill because the lad would not condone his crime. A deal of sympathy was consequently arising for Lionel and was being testified to him on every hand. Were he to accede to such a proposal as Oliver now made him, assuredly he must jeopardize all that.|$|E
