5|$|Playing college {{football}} for Louisiana State University (LSU), Taylor led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior. He {{was selected by}} the Packers {{in the second round}} of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used sparingly as a rookie, but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team's all-purpose back, especially when <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> were needed. In this role, his spirited performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it {{just short of the}} goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E

25|$|SR-195 {{started at}} a four-way {{intersection}} with SR-266 {{in what is}} now the city of Holladay; though not state-maintained, the road extended a few blocks south of SR-266, passing Holladay Elementary (now Holladay's city hall), to a nearly 45° three-way intersection with Holladay Boulevard (which itself intersected Murray-Holladay Road (former SR-174) <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> (meters) south of that). The proximity of the two intersections caused complex traffic problems that were solved in the late 2000s (decade) by pedestrianizing Holladay Boulevard northwest of the intersection.|$|E
25|$|He {{collapsed}} in Mexico City on Saturday, December 6, 1924, while attending {{a meeting of}} the Pan-American Federation of Labor. It was recognized that his condition was critical and that he might not survive for long. Gompers expressed the desire to die on American soil, and he was placed aboard a special train and sped toward the border. Gompers was buried at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Gompers is buried <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> away from industrialist Andrew Carnegie, another important figure of industry in the Gilded Age.|$|E

25|$|The club, however, {{embarked}} on a strong FA Cup run, albeit with two replays. They surpassed Leicester City 4–2, Notts County 5–0, Aston Villa 3–0 and Reading 1–0 – all at home – and consequently made it to an FA Cup semi-final, where they were drawn against rivals Manchester United. It {{was the first time}} both teams had met at Wembley, new or old, and the second time they had met in the FA Cup semi-final, with City beating United 3–0 in 1926. Over 86,000 packed Wembley to watch the match with a further 9.5 million watching on TV – nearly half the viewing audience at the time – during the last 15 minutes of the game. United controlled the first 30 minutes with striker Dimitar Berbatov having a one-on-one shot with City goalkeeper Joe Hart saved and seconds later missed from <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> out having spooned his shot over the bar, while Nemanja Vidić headed wide from a pinpoint corner. From the 30th minute, however, City started to come into the game, with a fierce shot from Mario Balotelli saved, a Vincent Kompany shot narrowly missing the target and Joleon Lescott wastefully volleying over from a corner having been in space; City went into the half-time interval with cause for optimism. Roared on by their supporters, City continued the momentum they had generated before the break, with the breakthrough coming in the 52nd minute after Yaya Touré caught central midfielder Michael Carrick unaware, pouncing on a sluggish pass, sliding the ball past Vidić and then through goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar's legs to make the score 1–0. From then on, City had found confidence, controlling the game with some new-found aplomb, limiting United to one opportunity which provoked a strong save from a deflected Nani free-kick. Paul Scholes was later sent off in the 72nd minute after his studs speared into Pablo Zabaleta's right thigh, and the match ultimately finished in a 1–0 City victory, ensuring progression to the FA Cup final. On 10 May, Champions League qualification was secured with a 1–0 win over Tottenham, in which an own goal from Peter Crouch secured the win. A 1–0 win over Stoke on 14 May 2011 secured their fifth FA Cup. The result gave City their first major trophy in 35 years, with Mancini dedicating the victory to the long-suffering supporters and urged his team to use the win to provide impetus for achieving greater success.|$|E

At [...] the troops on the right flank of the 61st Division began to fall back until rallied on a line dug slightly north of Somme Farm. On the right flank, the 13th RS made several attempts to get forward by shell-hole rushes but found it impossible against the massed machine-gun fire from the German fortifications. Two small German counter-attacks from [...] were driven off with help from the 47th Division to the south and German small-arms fire was eventually subdued by constant rifle and Lewis-gun fire. During the evening, reports were received of troops near Beck House, Borry Farm, Iberian Farm and Gallipoli and orders were issued to rush the positions in the dark. The attacks failed against alert opposition but the line was advanced about [...] towards Gallipoli, until cross fire stopped the advance and the new position was consolidated.|$|E
2500|$|Howard led 'D' Company and an {{engineer}} detachment, in a glider-borne assault {{in the early}} hours of 6 June 1944. Released at 8,000 feet over the Normandy coast, three gliders, each carrying about 28 heavily armed troops—in total 90 men, pilots included—clipped the tops of a group of poplar trees skirting a very small field and a dangerous pool and bounced to a halt <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> from each other, at precisely 0016 hours. All gliders were brought to an immediate halt, almost on top of the objectivesthe nose was [...] "buried in barbed wire and almost on the bridge", in the words of a soldier under Howard. [...] The assault troops engaged their objectives almost from the moment they stepped outside of the wreckage of their aircraft. [...] The German defenders were taken completely by surprise for they had almost no time to react, form, and attempt a defence of the objectives; since the British force had, in effect, landed within the boundary of the objective. [...] Some of the Germans were caught asleep in their gun pits. Only one German soldier was able to fire a Very pistol to try to warn soldiers on the Orne bridge a few hundred yards away, but by the time he fired, the other bridge had been overrun. There was no time to attempt to blow the bridge, and even if there had been, the explosives needed for the job had never been fitted to the bridge. It was the classic example of a “commando-style” military operation, where surprise is the attacker’s greatest asset; and when it is executed as planned, surprise is complete because the attackers in the event, face essentially no opposition. And virtually all of their casualties in the assault, are either from friendly fire, or accident.|$|E
