40|$|Hereditary {{multiple}} exostosis (HME) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized {{by two or}} more benign growing, cartilage capped tumors of long bones called <b>osteochondromas.</b> If abnormal growth and clinical symptoms of <b>osteochondromas</b> newly appear in adults, malignant transformation of the usually benign growing tumors should be suspected and diagnostic testing should be initiated. Against the background of hypothesized higher malignant transformation of <b>osteochondromas</b> into chondrosarcoma in individuals with shoulder exostoses, we report a case of bilateral scapulothoracic <b>osteochondromas</b> in a patient suffering from HME. A 60 -year-old female with HME complained of chest pain while being hospitalized for bilateral femoral fractures. A computed tomography scan of the chest was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism. However, bilateral <b>osteochondromas</b> in the scapulothoracic spaces were detected. Due to absence of radiographic evidences for malignant transformation in the patient, invasive diagnostic procedures such as biopsy and histological examination were recommended in order to exclude malignant transformation of both <b>osteochondromas.</b> Physicians {{should be aware that}} patients with HME who present with shoulder pain should be examined for <b>osteochondromas</b> in the scapulothoracic space.

50|$|Tests for <b>osteochondroma</b> {{can also}} {{identify}} {{diseases such as}} secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and Multiple osteochondromatosis. In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises {{at the site of}} <b>osteochondroma</b> due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple osteochondromatosis are similar to solitary <b>osteochondroma,</b> but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to <b>osteochondroma,</b> DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in autosomal dominant mode.|$|E

40|$|Background: Forearm <b>osteochondromas</b> {{are found}} in a vast {{majority}} of patients diagnosed with Multiple Hereditary Exostoses - Multiple <b>Osteochondromas</b> (MHE-MO). Common complaints include pain, functional impairment, and cosmetic concerns. So far, there is no consensus regarding optimal treatment or adequate surgical indications as little research has been performed in this population. Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} retrospectively describe and assess the results on range of motion and pain prior to and after surgical treatment of forearm <b>osteochondromas</b> and deformities. Secondary aim is to evaluate patient general and cosmetic satisfaction, and quality of life. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 82 patients surgically treated for forearm <b>osteochondromas</b> due to pain and/or functional impairment. Also, in a cross-sectional part a questionnaire was sent to all 82 patients. The questionnaire focused on patient general and cosmetic satisfaction, pain, and Quality of life Results: Pre-operative range of motion of the forearm and wrist in MHE-MO patients is limited and increases significantly (short- and long-term) after surgery in patients with an indication for surgery due to functional impairment. Pain decreases after surgery, regardless of the indication for surgery. Overall, MHE-MO patients are satisfied, but quality of life is significantly affected. Conclusion: Significant improvements are made in pain complaints and range of motion by excision of <b>osteochondromas</b> or corrective procedures in patients with forearm deformities in MHE-MO.

30|$|Multiple ostechondromas (MO), {{sometimes}} referred to as multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) is characterized by the outward growth of cartilage-capped bone tumours called <b>osteochondromas.</b> It is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by mutated exostosin genes (EXT 1 or EXT 2) [1]. The <b>osteochondromas</b> develop {{in the first decade of}} life and cease to grow once the patient reaches skeletal maturity. The long bones are almost always affected but <b>osteochondromas</b> are also found on the scapula, the ribs and the pelvis. MO can lead to growth disturbances including unequal limb length, joint deformity and disproportionate short stature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. A considerable number of patients suffer from pain or discomfort due to the disorder which significantly affects their quality of life [7]. Diminished or short stature is a common feature in patients with MO. In the majority of patients their height is below normal average height, but within a normal range [7, 8, 9]. The origin of this short or diminished stature in MO patients is still unknown. Hypothetically it might be due to a local effect from <b>osteochondromas</b> on the local growth plates or it might be due to a systemic effect.|$|R
5000|$|When used in {{the phrases}} [...] "cartilaginous exostosis" [...] or [...] "osteocartilaginous exostosis", the term is {{considered}} synonymous with <b>osteochondroma.</b> Some sources consider the two terms to mean the same thing even without qualifiers, but this interpretation is not universal.|$|E
50|$|Limited normal {{functions}} and movements {{are caused by}} osteochondromas growing slowly and inwardly. The majority of osteochondromas are symptomless and are found incidentally. Each individual with <b>osteochondroma</b> may experience symptoms differently {{and most of the}} time individuals will experience no symptoms at all. Some of the most common symptoms are a hard immobile painless palpable mass, adjacent muscle soreness, and pressure or irritation with heavy exercising.Major symptoms arise when complications such as fractures, bone deformity or mechanical joint problems occur. If the occurrence of an <b>osteochondroma</b> is near a nerve or a blood vessel, the affected limb can experience numbness, weakness, loss of pulse or color change. Periodic changes in the blood flow can also take place. Approximately 20% of patients experiencing nerve compression commonly acknowledge vascular compression, arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm. Formation of pseudoaneurysm and venous thrombosis lead to claudication, pain, acute ischemia, and symptoms of phlebitis. If the tumor is found under a tendon, it can cause pain during movement causing restriction of joint motion. Pain can also occur due to bursal inflammation, swelling or fracture at the base of the tumor stalk. Some of the clinical signs and symptoms of malignant <b>osteochondroma</b> are pain, swelling, and mass enlargement.|$|E

40|$|Aims We {{report a}} {{prospective}} cohort {{study of the}} midterm results of surgical dislocation of the hip (according to Ganz) to perform resection of <b>osteochondromas</b> involving the femoral neck in patients with multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE). Methods Hip range of movement (ROM) was assessed pre-and post-operatively. Patients' judgment of post-operative reduction of pain, symptoms, the Rand 36 -item Health Survey (RAND- 36) and complications were analysed. Results Symptomatic <b>osteochondromas</b> of the femoral neck were removed in 20 hips (17 patients) between 2007 and 2012. There were nine men and eight women {{with a mean age}} at the time of surgery of 29 years (11 to 47). Mean follow-up was 46 months (26 to 73). At latest follow-up, mean ROM was significantly increased in all directions. Post-operatively the pain associated with the lesion was either significantly decreased or non-existent. There was a significant improvement in seven RAND- 36 sub-domains. Encountered complications in four patients were pseudoarthrosis of the trochanteric osteotomy, traumatic separation of the trochanteric osteotomy, a pertrochanteric femoral fracture and avasvular necrosis. Histological analysis revealed <b>osteochondromas</b> in all hips.

50|$|Osteochondromas {{are long}} and slender, pedunculated on a stalk often taking {{the shape of a}} cauliflower. The {{cartilage}} cap is covered by fibrous perichondrium and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the <b>osteochondroma,</b> which is attached to the perichondrium of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma.Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and multiple osteochondromas have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11. About 70-75% of multiple osteochondromas are caused by point mutations, often involving deletion of single or multiple axons as found in 10% of all hereditary cases. In about 10-15% of all cases no genomic alterations are detected. The mechanism behind the formation of multiple <b>osteochondroma</b> is large genomic deletions of EXT1 and EXT2 genes. The identified mechanism behind solitary osteochondromas is the homozygous deletions of the EXT1 gene. However, the exact cause of <b>osteochondroma</b> is unknown. Additionally, the molecular basis of genetics and clinical variability of multiple <b>osteochondroma</b> as well as the underlying causes for the malignant transformation and the onset of <b>osteochondroma</b> in EXT negative patients is also currently unknown.|$|E
50|$|Osteochondromas are benign lesions and do {{not affect}} life expectancy. Complete {{excision}} of <b>osteochondroma</b> is curative and the reoccurrences take place when the removal of tumor is incomplete. Multiple reoccurrences in a well-excised lesion indicate {{that it may be}} malignant. The risk of malignant transformation takes place in 1-5% of individuals. If any symptoms of cancerous tumor takes place, then the patient should be evaluated by a bone specialist. No treatment is necessary for Solitary osteochondromas that are asymptomatic. Treatments for solitary <b>osteochondroma</b> are careful observation over time and taking regular x-rays to monitor any changes in the tumor. If the lesion is causing pain with activity, nerve or vessel impingement, or if the bone growth has fully matured and the presence of a large cartilage cap is prominent, then it is advised that the tumor be surgically removed.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} the length of the ulna as a proportion of height (proportional ulnar length [PUL]), forearm and wrist ranges of motion, and degree of observable deformity in people with hereditary multiple exostoses. METHODS: One hundred forty-two people with hereditary multiple exostoses were examined; 35 were under the age of 15 years and therefore were presumed to be skeletally immature. Elbow, forearm, and wrist motion were measured, and the radius and ulna were palpated for <b>osteochondromas.</b> Ulnar length was estimated as a proportion of height (PUL) in skeletally immature subjects. The relationships between total active motion, number of palpable <b>osteochondromas,</b> and proportional length were examined for one randomly selected limb from each subject. RESULTS: A negative correlation was found between the number of palpable <b>osteochondromas</b> and range of forearm rotation. The degree of forearm motion in those under the age of 15 years was directly related to PUL and indirectly related to the number of palpable <b>osteochondromas.</b> Children whose PUL is within the normal range have a normal range of motion.

Unexpectedly, while studying the role of β-catenin in cartilage development, we found that its conditional deletion induces ectopic chondroma-like cartilage formation in mice. Postnatal ablation of β-catenin in cartilage induced lateral outgrowth of the growth plate within 2 weeks after ablation. The chondroma-like masses were present in the flanking periosteum by 5 weeks and persisted for more than 6 months after β-catenin ablation. These long-lasting ectopic masses rarely contained apoptotic cells. In good correlation, transplants of β-catenin-deficient chondrocytes into athymic mice persisted {{for a longer period of}} time and resisted replacement by bone compared to control wild-type chondrocytes. In contrast, a β-catenin signaling stimulator increased cell death in control chondrocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the amount of detectable β-catenin in cartilage cells of <b>osteochondromas</b> obtained from hereditary multiple exostoses patients was much lower than that in hypertrophic chondrocytes in normal human growth plates.
