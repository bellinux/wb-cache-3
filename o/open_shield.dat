25|$|The design {{criteria}} were speed of build, improved damage-control and anti-aircraft and torpedo capabilities. The hull design was simplified and {{shorter than the}} Fubukis, partly due {{to a reduction in}} the number of boilers, which itself resulted in a significant reduction in speed. The heretofore standard six 5inch, 50 calibre weapons were replaced by three Type 89 5inch/40 calibre guns which performed better than its predecessor in an AA role. The enclosed turrets were also replaced by a forward single <b>open</b> <b>shield</b> and an aft twin open mounting. This major redesign delivered a significantly smaller ship (1,280 tons). A number of the class were modified to transport kaiten.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} designs, distributed on 1 September 1863, differ somewhat {{from those}} legislated in March. This, the Roman eagle, wings outstretched, wearing the princely crown, carries the princely scepter in its right talon and the sword in its left; on its breast appears an <b>open</b> <b>shield</b> topped by the princely crown. On {{the left of}} the shield, over azure and gold, is the Wallachian eagle (a cross in its beak, in left profile and wearing the princely crown); on the right, over red and azure, is the Moldavian aurochs with a star between its horns. Hanging from the scepter and sword is a red ribbon with gold-embossed letters: “HONOR ET PATRIA” (“honor and Fatherland”). In the fly corners the prince’s initial is stitched, surrounded by a laurel wreath; all are golden. Each flag also had inscribed the unit that bore it. The cloth part was 122 centimeter long and 100 centimeter wide. A metal Roman eagle was affixed to the tip of the flagpole. Although the order of 19 March had the Moldavian symbol in the right, nevertheless the first on the shield is the Wallachian eagle. The design was most likely adopted due to customary usage that arose after Bucharest became the single capital in February 1862.|$|E
40|$|Cost-effective and {{permissible}} tunneling {{can occur}} only if ground movement prediction is refined to accommodate changes {{in both the}} urban environment and tunneling technology. As cities age, tunnels are being installed closer to existing structures and in increasingly complicated belowground conditions. The reality of stacked tunnels, abandoned facilities, and more extensive use of underground space {{raises the question of}} whether relationships derived for single open-shield tunnels in free-field conditions can adequately predict ground movement for modern tunneling techniques with more complicated site conditions. Traditional empirical methods to predict maximum surface settlements and the percentage of lost ground for paired tunnels of the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM) in noncohesive soils are evaluated. Predictive data are compared with field measurements for grouted and nongrouted sections. Results showed that the estimated maximum settlement values of an NATM tunnel were highly similar to those of an <b>open</b> <b>shield</b> tunnel for both the grouted and ungrouted sections, although in some cases the Gaussian shape significantly underestimated the depth of the settlement trough in the outer 30 % to 40 %. Grouting substantially altered the amount of settlement. The average percentage of volume of lost ground with grouting was 1. 6 %, whereas the value was 5. 2 % where no grouting occurred. The empirical methods typically generated a fairly reasonable set of responses for an NATM tunnel...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A comprehensive review of the published work is presented on field, laboratory modelling and theoretical data relating to ground movements associated with trenchiess pipelaying techniques. Due to the similarities with convergent trenchiess techniques, soft ground tunnelling work is also reviewed. The factors that influence these ground movements are isolated {{and the ability to}} investigate these considered in terms of model tests. A test facility based on a l. 5 m long,l. 5 m high and l. Om wide steel tank has been developed and this is described together with the philosophy behind its use. The development of appropriate methods of simulating both pipejacking and pipebursting trenchiess techniques using the test facility, based on the installation of a 200 mm diameter semicircular steel pipe section, are described. The use of a stereo-photogrammetry technique for the ground movement data acquisition is also reported and assessed. Three programmes of model tests were conducted: <b>open</b> <b>shield</b> pipejacking, closed shield pipejacking and pipebursting. The test programmes included investigations into the effects on the soil movements of variations in cover depth, overcut ratio (pipejacking tests), bursting ratio (pipebursting tests) and the effect of using different dry sands at different densities. From the photographs obtained during the tests, the sand displacements were determined in both the longitudinal and perpendicular planes to the pipe installation. These displacements allowed contour plots to be produced for the horizontal and vertical components of these displacements. This allowed the interaction of the various areas of sand movement to be appreciated, and the extents and magnitudes to be investigated for the changes in the factors made between each test. The extension of the results to other test conditions not directly investigated and also to the limited field data available, is made by using interpolation and extrapolation of graphical plots of the test data. These graphical plots also allowed trends in the data to be highlighted. This project involved a fundamental study of ground movements. However, guidance is given on how the results obtained from the tests can be used to determine the effects on adjacent services and structures. This is presented bearing in mind that the test results were for laboratory model simulations rather than prototype operations. Two simple theoretical analyses are described, one based on the error function curve and one using a fluid flow method. The error function analysis is used to predict ground movements in the perpendicular plane to the installation, while the fluid flow analysis, with dilation and compression capabilities, is developed to enable ground movements to be predicted in both the perpendicular and longitudinal planes. The analyses were applied to the laboratory model tests and the results correlated very well. The results of the laboratory model tests and the theoretical analyses developed, considerably extend the understanding and knowledge on the ground movements associated with trenchless pipelaying techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} algorithm to rigorously derive the spectral-domain impedance dyadic Green’s function for MMIC’s on general complex anisotropic or bi-anisotropic sub-strates is developed. The main {{advantage of the}} applied tech-nique is that it provides closed-f~rm expressions for transverse propagation constants and related irnmittances in the spectral domain and, therefore, allows the following parameters {{to be taken into}} acconnt: dielectric and magnetic losses of aniso-tropic or bi-anisotropic media without restrictions to the mag-nitude of tensor elements, alternative directions for magnetic bias, the finite metallization thickness of conventional conduc-tors and /or superconductors including their losses, microstrip and coplanar waveguide structures in <b>open,</b> <b>shielded</b> and con-ductor-backed technology. The theory is verified by compari-son with previously published data. The flexibility is demon-strated for both superconductor and conventional conductor (M) MIC structures on ferrite-dielectric or bi-anisotropic sub-strates with different directions for magnetic bias. The CPU time is 10 - 20 seconds per frequency sample on a modern work-station. 1...|$|R

Unlike its predecessors, the Sidestrand could fly at 140 mph making operating the guns in exposed positions difficult, particularly in the nose. The Overstrand was fitted with an enclosed and powered nose turret with a Lewis gun, the first RAF aircraft to have a power-operated turret.

50|$|The first {{operational}} bomber {{to carry}} an enclosed, power-operated turret was the British Boulton & Paul Overstrand twin-engined biplane, which first flew in 1933.
