5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first to fifth tergites.|$|E

5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because {{it was based on}} an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|During a 2003 {{biological}} {{inventory of}} the Mikea Forest, a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus Macrotarsomys was collected. This animal {{turned out to be}} distinct from both previously known species of the genus—bastard big-footed mouse, which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger greater big-footed mouse, known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ankarafantsika National Park. Accordingly, Steven Goodman and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, Macrotarsomys petteri. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist Francis Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed mouse, the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed mouse, which may be its closest relative.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus is {{currently}} regarded as having two valid species: type species E. regalis, and E. annectens. E. regalis is known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, {{dating from the}} late Campanian stage of the late Cretaceous period. At least a dozen individuals are known, including seven skulls with associated postcrania, and five to seven other skulls. The species formerly known as Thespesius edmontoni or Anatosaurus edmontoni represents immature individuals.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself, but <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E
5|$|In 1683, the Sich Rada voted {{that the}} ministers in the Sich's Pokrovskyi Cathedral (the main cathedral of the sich) should be <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mezhyhirya Monastery.

5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus {{from the middle}} Miocene of France. First {{described}} in 2002, it is known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> site of La Grive M, where it occurs with another fossil Miniopterus species, the smaller and more common Miniopterus fossilis. M.zapfei is known from five mandibles (lower jaws) and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M.fossilis and the cingulum shelf surrounding the P4 is less well-developed than in living Miniopterus. The length of the first lower molar is 1.57 to 1.60mm.|$|E

5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|Of the two subfamilies, tyrannosaurines {{appear to}} have been more widespread. Albertosaurines are unknown in Asia, which was home to the tyrannosaurines, such as Tarbosaurus and Zhuchengtyrannus, and Qianzhousaurus and Alioramus of the Alioramini. Both the Tyrannosaurinae and Albertosaurinae subfamilies were present in the Campanian and early Maastrichtian stages of North America, with tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus ranging {{throughout}} the Western Interior, while the albertosaurines Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus are currently known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwestern part of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Polytolypa hystricis {{is known}} <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum.

5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy cabbage flea beetle or the bronze Lundy cabbage flea beetle, is a species of flea beetle endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lundy cabbage.
