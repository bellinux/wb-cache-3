5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since {{only a small part of}} the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E
5|$|When Sony/ATV led the {{consortium}} that acquired EMI Music Publishing in 2012 (with Sony/ATV becoming administrator and 38% shareholder), {{it became the}} largest publishing company in the world, with more than 2 million songs and estimated revenues of over US$1.25billion per year.

25|$|In 1948, Giroux rejoined Harcourt, {{where he}} became {{executive}} editor and worked the supervision of Frank Morley, {{a former director of}} Faber & Faber. He published many novels rejected by <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> houses, such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (1952), Kerouac's The Town and the City (1950) and O'Connor's Wise Blood (1952).

25|$|Early in {{his life}} Maxwell escaped from Nazi occupation, joined the Czechoslovak Army in exile in the Second World War and was {{decorated}} after active service in the British Army. In subsequent years he worked in publishing, building up Pergamon Press to a major publishing house. After six years as an MP during the 1960s, he again put all his energy into business, successively buying the British Printing Corporation, Mirror Group Newspapers and Macmillan, Inc, among <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> companies.|$|E
25|$|In 1779, Casanova found Francesca, an uneducated seamstress, {{who became}} his live-in lover and housekeeper, and who loved him devotedly. Later that year, the Inquisitors {{put him on}} the payroll and sent him to {{investigate}} commerce between the Papal states and Venice. <b>Other</b> <b>publishing</b> and theater ventures failed, primarily from lack of capital. In a downward spiral, Casanova was expelled again from Venice in 1783, after writing a vicious satire poking fun at Venetian nobility. In it he made his only public statement that Grimani was his true father.|$|E
25|$|In addition, war {{narratives}} {{were transformed}} into literature by (among others) the publishing houses, which distorted the perception {{and treatment of}} captivity. Nicolas Beaupré cites the letter of one of Éditions Berger-Levrault’s directors in which he insists on giving a direction to the publication of war stories, more for vainglory than a depiction of events: “Currently we, more than any <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> house, are editing, as much at Nancy as in Paris, with very restrained means. If we can hold on and publish only good publications on the war, the House will emerge from the conflict in more of a starring role than before”. Still, sales for war stories quickly dropped as popular demand shifted elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Several Irish short-story anthologies {{have been}} {{published}} since 2000 {{to meet the demands}} of the reading public, for example: the Faber Book of Best New Irish Short Stories in 2005 and 2007; Irish Short Stories (2011), edited by Joseph O'Connor; Town and Country: New Irish Short Stories (2013), edited and with an introduction by Kevin Barry; The Granta Book of the Irish Short Story was published in 2010, edited and with an introduction by Anne Enright.; Silver Threads of Hope, edited by Anne Enright and Sinéad Gleeson in 2012; and The Long Gaze Back: An Anthology of Irish Women Writers (2015), edited by Sinéad Gleeson.

25|$|These Amnesia Fortnight periods proved fortuitous, as Schafer {{considers}} {{these to}} {{have kept the}} company viable. Upon completion of Brütal Legend, Double Fine started work on its sequel, but was told to stop development shortly after as Electronic Arts decided against publishing it. With no <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> deals lined up at the time, Schafer {{turned back to the}} eight game ideas developed from Amnesia Fortnight, believing they could be developed further into short, complete games. Schafer also looked at the success of smaller focused games like Geometry Wars on the various download services, realizing the potential market for similar titles. Schafer and his team selected the best four, and began shopping the games to various publishers, and successfully worked publishing details with these. Two of these games, Costume Quest and Stacking, were picked up by THQ and released digitally on the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network storefronts; both games were considered successful and THQ expressed interest in helping Double Fine produce similar titles in the future. Iron Brigade (originally titled Trenched but changed due to trademark issues) was developed as an Xbox Live Arcade game in association with Microsoft Game Studios, and similarly received positive praise from journalists. A fourth game, , was published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in association with the Sesame Workshop for the Xbox 360 using the Kinect controller; though initially not a licensed title, Schafer and his team found it to be an ideal fit for their first licensed-property game. The four unused ideas may be used for a game in the future, according to Schafer, but believes some of them may be unsellable to a publisher.|$|E

In 1949, Crawford anonymously edited The Machine-God Laughs, which contained Pragnell's story {{and two more}} stories from Fantasy Book.

[...] In 1953, Crawford's <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> company, FPCI, issued Science and Sorcery, edited by [...] "Garret Ford", the pseudonym used by the Crawfords when they edited Fantasy Book.

500|$|In 1871, John Hollingshead {{commissioned}} Gilbert to {{work with}} Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas, Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old, at the Gaiety Theatre. Thespis outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond {{the length of a}} normal run at the Gaiety, [...] However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways. Gilbert worked again with Clay on Happy Arcadia (1872), and with Alfred Cellier on Topsyturveydom (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contribution for Fun magazine ("Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> interests.|$|E
500|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{originally}} {{going to be}} published by ASCII Entertainment, the publishers for The Silver Case. Policy changes at ASCII meant that the whole project was in danger of being cancelled as they would no longer support the game. Suda ended up pitching to <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> houses, eventually gaining the support of Victor Interactive Software. This approach of pitching to new publishers with each title would be adopted by the developer for multiple subsequent titles to protect their status as an independent studio. It was during this period that he met Yasuhiro Wada, with whom he collaborated on future projects for Grasshopper Manufacture. The change of publisher, along with its release date, was publicly announced in February 2001. Over the following months, the game was featured in multiple Japanese magazines, and was exhibited at that year's first Tokyo Game Show. The game's opening used a mixture of live-action and in-game footage; the live action footage featured actress and model Mia Murano. In addition to its Japanese title, the game's title was translated into English, giving rise to its common acronym [...] "FSR". Flower, Sun, and Rain was released on May 2, 2001. The PS2 version was not released outside Japan. It was speculated that this was due to the game's content mirroring recent terrorist attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Double Fine {{announced}} in March 2014 {{that it would}} begin publishing indie games under the moniker Double Fine Presents. Using that program, Double Fine makes its publishing capabilities and offices available for other independent developers to help them finish their work by funding, publishing, and promoting it. The idea came about during the Amnesia Fortnight 2014, where local San Francisco independent developers were working alongside Double Fine in their studios during the two-week period, {{with the intent to}} help give them exposure through the production process as it was filmed by 2 Player Productions. The idea of Double Fine providing more long-term assistance to these indies arose during this event, forming the basis for this program. According to Double Fine's COO Justin Bailey, the goal of this approach is to [...] "help indies build their own community and empower them with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed on their own", providing them assistance [...] "customized to what indies need without also creating a certain codependence" [...] that <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> means require.|$|E
