25|$|Animal persons (usually {{mammals and}} birds, but {{including}} insects) appear {{to enjoy a}} relative autonomy which is lacking {{in the case of}} the animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they play varying social roles.

Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The howler monkey, for example, is commonly depicted in the social role of a writer and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians.

40|$|Deep avian {{evolutionary}} {{relationships have}} been difficult to resolve {{as a result of a}} putative explosive radiation. Our study examined ~ 32 kilobases of aligned nuclear DNA sequences from 19 independent loci for 169 species, representing all major extant groups, and recovered a robust phylogeny from a genome-wide signal supported by multiple analytical methods. We documented well-supported, previously unrecognized interordinal relationships (such as a sister relationship between passerines and parrots) and corroborated previously contentious groupings (such as flamingos and grebes). Our conclusions challenge current classifications and alter our understanding of trait evolution; for example, some diurnal birds evolved from nocturnal ancestors. Our results provide a valuable resource for phylogenetic and comparative studies in birds. Although well studied, the evolutionaryrelationships among major avian groupsare contentious (1 – 6). Recovering deep evolutionary relationships in birds is difficult, probably reflecting a rapid divergence early in their evolutionary history (1 – 3, 7, 8) that has resulted in many distinctive, morphologically co-hesive groups (e. g., <b>owls,</b> <b>parrots,</b> and doves) wit...|$|R

Cornell did not like to give interviews, and prior to his death the most information available was found in the catalog for his one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art.

50|$|More {{and more}} {{tourists}} are venturing into western Queensland {{and the most}} preferred campsites are {{on the edges of}} lakes and waterholes. Visitors use the riparian timber for campfire fuel, especially hollow branches and logs and over a long period totally degrade habitat for hollow-dwelling fauna such as ducks, <b>parrots,</b> <b>owls,</b> bats and reptiles. Disturbance of nesting birds by human activity in the heat of a summer’s day can result in the death of unhatched chicks. Unleashed pet dogs can also be devastating to ground-nesting waterbirds and can also disturb wading birds and ground-dwelling fauna. Some visitors also create new vehicle tracks, which tend to draw others to continually expand their presence and impact. Other issues include the inappropriate disposal of rubbish and human excrement.|$|R

50|$|As the thorax is {{compressed}} by {{the flight}} muscles during downstroke, the upper {{ends of the}} furcula spread apart, expanding {{by as much as}} 50% of its resting width, and then contracts. X-ray films of starlings in flight have shown that in addition to strengthening the thorax, the furcula acts like a spring in the pectoral girdle during flight. It expands when the wings are pulled downward and snaps back as they are raised. Acting like a spring, the furcula is able to store some of the energy generated by contraction in the breast muscles, expanding the shoulders laterally, and then releasing the energy during upstroke as the furcula snaps back to the normal position. This, in turn, draws the shoulders toward the midline of the body. While the starling has a moderately large and strong furcula for a bird of its size, there are many species where the furcula is completely absent, for instance scrubbirds, some toucans and New World barbets, some <b>owls,</b> some <b>parrots,</b> turacos, and mesites. These birds are still fully capable of flying. They also have close relatives where the furcula is vestigal, reduced to a thin strap of ossified ligament, seemingly purposeless. Other species have evolved the furcula in the opposite direction, where it has increased in size and become too stiff or massive to act as a spring. In strong flyers like cranes and falcons, the arms of the furcula are large, hollow and quite rigid.|$|R
40|$|All {{birds have}} in common that their {{offspring}} hatch from eggs that develop outside the mother's body, but the structural and functional state in which young birds hatch varies enormously between species. When megapode chicks emerge from their egg, buried in warm soil or decomposing litter, they are fully feathered and capable of digging themselves to the surface, walking about, keeping warm and finding their own food without any help from their parents, and they can fly within a day. At the other extreme, the chicks of most songbirds, <b>owls</b> and <b>parrots</b> hatch without any feathers, with closed eyes and poorly developed muscles, and incapable of doing much more than raise their heads and beg for food when something (a parent?) arrives at the nest, swallow, and digest. They are almost totally dependent on their parents for staying warm, detecting predators, and food acquisition. They remain so {{for an extended period}} in which they stay in the nest and, for some aspects like feeding, even beyond. Many other bird species fall at varying points in between these two extremes, both with respect to the state of the chick at hatching and to the subsequent developmental trajectory. This diversity includes multiple anatomical and physiological traits, behaviour, and parent-offspring relationships. These traits partly vary independently of each other, but there is sufficient covariation among them to distinguish a single major axis of variation, which is known as the altricial-precocial spectrum (Nice 1962, Starck & Ricklefs 1998). Of the several classifications that have been proposed to subdivide this gradient, that of (Nice 1962) has become the most used (fig. 1. 1). ...|$|R
5000|$|In most {{aspects of}} their behavior, great horned owls are typical of owls and most birds of prey. From {{experimentally}} raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington {{felt that they were}} a bird of “essentially low intelligence” who could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt. On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared his captive raised behaviorally great horned <b>owls</b> to <b>parrots,</b> which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful “it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance”. Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive. Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for falconry or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington. Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as “completely random as Errington suggested”; while “Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...Cottontails, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.” ...|$|R
