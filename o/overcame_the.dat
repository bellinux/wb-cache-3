40|$|In {{a number}} of {{countries}} in the world since the nineteenth century transitions have taken place from authoritarian to liberal democratic systems. The transformation of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes has become a central topic of political science investigations. These studies aimed at analyzing the causes, elements and the course of such transformations. But the form of dealing with the past in the transformation process was only marginally considered. In Germany, after 1945 <b>the</b> concept of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past was developed for this group of problems as a result of analyzing the inheritance of dictatorship. The concept was revived when the system changed in the former German Democratic Republic and a desire arose to overhaul the past of this dictatorship. Despite the lively discussion about <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past up to now there still does not exist a generally accepted definition, let alone a theory of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past. Generally speaking one may understand by <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past the method of dealing with the inheritance of dictatorial regimes. Not only in Germany, but in any country that goes through a process of transformation there appears a questioning of the truth regarding the crimes committed during the dictatorship, the responsibility of the authors, the amnesty or criminal prosecution, restitution for the victims and not least the reconciliation of the society. In the present study this set of problems is taken up. The specific goal of the study is to perform an analysis of the role played by <b>the</b> way of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past in the system change. The basic thesis is that <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is a central element in the system change and that both processes mutually influence each other. <b>The</b> role of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past played in a transition is analyzed based on the case example of democratization in Chile. From <b>the</b> thesis that <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is a central element of the system change derives the second goal of this study: to provide building blocks for a theory of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past. However, this study can not provide a complete theory as this would have to be accomplished in a meaningful way with a comparative analysis between processes of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past in different countries. For this reason, the present study is restricted to only provide building blocks for a theory of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past. To follow the goals of the study, first of all the concepts to be used are explained. Therefore the existing literature about the topic of a system change as well as about <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is reviewed. A profound analysis of the different theories regarding system changes led to the conclusion that Merkel’s theory integration represents the best guide to study the case example. For this reason and based on Merkel models the phases of the Chilean transition are defined. Afterwards the methods that were applied in each stage to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past are described. In addition, it is analyzed which actors took part in <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past and what interests they pursued. Methods and actors are analyzed at the political system and political culture levels. Between 1970 and 1973 the Chilean political system suffered due to its inability to handle the different demands and confrontations of the social and political groups. Chile went during these years from a limited to a general crisis, which ended up in a growing political polarization and a “disinstitutionalization” of the ways of confrontation. These conditions led to the military coup executed by the armed and police forces in 1973. After the coup a military junta took over the control of the government. Chile lived for fifteen years under different states of martial law which favored human rights violations. According to estimates 18, 000 people were apprehended till December 1973; until 1975 the number rose to between 40, 000 and 50, 000. In addition, many Chileans were forced to go into exile or lost their jobs due to politically motivated measures. According to the report of the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation and its successor organization 3, 179 people lost their lives. After the failure of a system change forced from below, {{by the end of the}} eighties a Negotiated Way to Transition was developed in Chile. Opposition and government got into the typical stalemate situation that finally produces this form of transition. This scenario had fundamental consequences for <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past. The subsequent democratic government was forced to base its actions to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past on the negotiated transition rules. On the other hand and in view of the stalemate situation it had to take into account the opinion of the other side in the execution of its measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past. <b>Overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is a process that takes place in a transition from an authoritarian to a democratic political system. Since <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is embedded in the process of transition, this latter influences its course. An example thereof is the influence that the manner of ending the authoritarian system has on the possible measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past. In addition, <b>the</b> process to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past changes in the course of transition. In this sense the necessary measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past differ according to the different phases of transition. During the phase of institutionalization of democracy the foundations of the coming new democracy as well as those of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past are set. On the other hand, already in this period of time the conflict lines of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past become apparent. Depending on the progress of democratic consolidation the goals as well as <b>the</b> ways of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past differ. During the early years the symbols and measures of reparation as well as the unveiling of the truth of human rights violations are important to mitigate the pressure exerted on the political system. As soon as democracy has become more consolidated, the method of criminal proceedings to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past can be reinforced without endangering the democracy. <b>The</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past takes place in the political system as well as in the political culture. In the political system <b>the</b> ways of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past and along with them the measures to be taken against the crimes committed in the past are defined. Regarding the political culture <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past refers to the different assessments that a specific society assigns to the common history during transition. The Chilean case shows, however, that the unveiling of human rights violations committed by the former regime and the discussion about the interpretation of history can truly get the opposing groups closer together, but do not necessarily lead them to a common history. Thanks to the differing measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past, but also to the discussion about the history within the society the past is worked up by the political system and the political culture. But no <b>overcoming</b> of <b>the</b> past takes place. This may be observed by the repeated appearance of discussions regarding the past in the Chilean transition. The pass of time will perhaps allow to forget the past, but it will not be able to <b>overcome</b> it. However, <b>the</b> past not <b>overcome</b> does not prevent society from democratically living together. The democratic living together of a society does not unconditionally need a common history as its foundation, but the belief in institutions that make the channelling of conflicts possible is absolutely unavoidable and, therefore, an indispensable backbone of a democratic political culture. The first goal of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past is the society’s analysis of the wrongs committed in the past. During the early years of transition the pressure on the political system is so great, that <b>the</b> measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past first seek to pacify the political system. If the political system does not react to the inputs of the different actors of <b>the</b> process to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past, these shall seek a solution beyond democratic rules. In this context <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past contributes to consolidate a new democracy. In addition <b>the</b> measures to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> past serve to legitimate the different institutions of the new democracy. To achieve <b>the</b> goals of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past the methods selected are of decisive importance. The application of these methods depends on the type and also on the phase of the transition. Differing actors participate in <b>the</b> process of <b>overcoming</b> <b>the</b> past. Just as it can be observed in the Chilean case, the actors try to impose their interests in the political system...|$|R
