5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy can have a stabilizing effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> contrary to new classical theory.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that while the subsidy reform plan needs further adaptation and fine-tuning, citizens must separate the questions of public policy from the issues of government legitimacy.

The Economist Intelligence Unit has also praised Iran's subsidies reform plan for its positive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, was prompted by the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union that resulted from Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia.

5|$|The {{duration}} of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role.

5|$|The written sources do {{not offer}} deep insight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of the kingdom; it counted mainly on {{agriculture}} during the Middle Bronze Age but, by the Late Bronze Age, it became based on trade with surrounding regions. Securing raw materials scarce near the city was an important concern for the rulers; basalt was an important building tool and it was probably acquired from the Salamiyah region or Al-Rastan. Calcite was provided from either the Syrian coast or Egypt, amber came from the Baltic region, while regions in modern Afghanistan provided carnelian and lapis-lazul.|$|E

5|$|Trucks are vitally {{important}} to U.S. industry, however, measuring {{the impact of}} trucking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is more difficult, because trucking services are so intertwined with all sectors of the economy.

5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and {{over a period of}} 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> {{depended}} greatly {{upon the}} railroads in the area. The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E

5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, {{but these are not}} extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|Marco Antonio Barbaro, the Venetian bailo who {{had been}} imprisoned since 1570, {{conducted}} the negotiations. In view of the Republic's inability to regain Cyprus, the resulting treaty, signed on 7 March 1573, confirmed the new state of affairs: Cyprus became an Ottoman province, and Venice paid an indemnity of 300,000 ducats. In addition, {{the border between the}} two powers in Dalmatia was modified by the Turkish occupation of small but important parts of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities, with adverse effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia.|$|E
5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E

5|$|The end of World War II was {{followed}} by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on decreasing government expenditures on the military as quickly as possible. Demobilizing the military and reducing {{the size of the}} various services was a cost-saving priority. The effect of demobilization <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> was unknown, but fears existed that the nation would slide back into a depression. A great deal of work had to be done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. Government officials did not have consensus as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should take. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} {{which had}} plagued Honiara and the islands {{since the late}} 1990s had a devastating impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> {{due to the fact}} that virtually all tourist organisations around the world specifically warned tourists wishing to visit the islands to stay away, especially in 2002 and 2003 at the peak of the troubles. In 1998, the country earned around $13million from tourism and just $629,000 in 1999, equating to an average spend per visit of only US$254 (about US$35/day). In 1999, tourism in the city and nation accounted for just 4.38% of the total GDP.|$|E
5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would have a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and the food supply.
